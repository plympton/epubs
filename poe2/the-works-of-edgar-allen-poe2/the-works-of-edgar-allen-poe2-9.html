<p>(*1) Moraux is here derived from moeurs, and its meaning is "fashionable" or more strictly "of manners."</p>

<p>(*1) An incident, similar in outline to the one here imagined, occurred, not very long ago, in England. The name of the fortunate heir was Thelluson. I first saw an account of this matter in the "Tour" of Prince Puckler Muskau, who makes the sum inherited <i>ninety millions of pounds</i>, and justly observes that "in the contemplation of so vast a sum, and of the services to which it might be applied, there is something even of the sublime." To suit the views of this article I have followed the Prince's statement, although a grossly exaggerated one. The germ, and in fact, the commencement of the present paper was published many years ago&#8212;previous to the issue of the first number of Sue's admirable <i>Juif Errant</i>, which may possibly have been suggested to him by Muskau's account.</p>
