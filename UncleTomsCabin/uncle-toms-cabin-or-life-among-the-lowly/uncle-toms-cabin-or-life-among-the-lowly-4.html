<p>"I rather think I am," said honest John, with some considerable emphasis.</p>
<p>"I thought so," said the senator.</p>
<p>"If there's anybody comes," said the good man, stretching his tall, muscular form upward, "why here I'm ready for him: and I've got seven sons, each six foot high, and they'll be ready for 'em. Give our respects to 'em," said John; "tell 'em it's no matter how soon they call,&#8212;make no kinder difference to us," said John, running his fingers through the shock of hair that thatched his head, and bursting out into a great laugh.</p>
<p>Weary, jaded, and spiritless, Eliza dragged herself up to the door, with her child lying in a heavy sleep on her arm. The rough man held the candle to her face, and uttering a kind of compassionate grunt, opened the door of a small bed-room adjoining to the large kitchen where they were standing, and motioned her to go in. He took down a candle, and lighting it, set it upon the table, and then addressed himself to Eliza.</p>
<p>"Now, I say, gal, you needn't be a bit afeard, let who will come here. I'm up to all that sort o' thing," said he, pointing to two or three goodly rifles over the mantel-piece; "and most people that know me know that 't wouldn't be healthy to try to get anybody out o' my house when I'm agin it. So <i>now</i> you jist go to sleep now, as quiet as if yer mother was a rockin' ye," said he, as he shut the door.</p>
<p>"Why, this is an uncommon handsome un," he said to the senator. "Ah, well; handsome uns has the greatest cause to run, sometimes, if they has any kind o' feelin, such as decent women should. I know all about that."</p>
<p>The senator, in a few words, briefly explained Eliza's history.</p>
<p>"O! ou! aw! now, I want to know?" said the good man, pitifully; "sho! now sho! That's natur now, poor crittur! hunted down now like a deer,&#8212;hunted down, jest for havin' natural feelin's, and doin' what no kind o' mother could help a doin'! I tell ye what, these yer things make me come the nighest to swearin', now, o' most anything," said honest John, as he wiped his eyes with the back of a great, freckled, yellow hand. "I tell yer what, stranger, it was years and years before I'd jine the church, 'cause the ministers round in our parts used to preach that the Bible went in for these ere cuttings up,&#8212;and I couldn't be up to 'em with their Greek and Hebrew, and so I took up agin 'em, Bible and all. I never jined the church till I found a minister that was up to 'em all in Greek and all that, and he said right the contrary; and then I took right hold, and jined the church,&#8212;I did now, fact," said John, who had been all this time uncorking some very frisky bottled cider, which at this juncture he presented.</p>
<p>"Ye'd better jest put up here, now, till daylight," said he, heartily, "and I'll call up the old woman, and have a bed got ready for you in no time."</p>
<p>"Thank you, my good friend," said the senator, "I must be along, to take the night stage for Columbus."</p>
<p>"Ah! well, then, if you must, I'll go a piece with you, and show you a cross road that will take you there better than the road you came on. That road's mighty bad."</p>
<p>John equipped himself, and, with a lantern in hand, was soon seen guiding the senator's carriage towards a road that ran down in a hollow, back of his dwelling. When they parted, the senator put into his hand a ten-dollar bill.</p>
<p>"It's for her," he said, briefly.</p>
<p>"Ay, ay," said John, with equal conciseness.</p>
<p>They shook hands, and parted.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00020">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00021">The Property Is Carried Off</h6>
<p>The February morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of Uncle Tom's cabin. It looked on downcast faces, the images of mournful hearts. The little table stood out before the fire, covered with an ironing-cloth; a coarse but clean shirt or two, fresh from the iron, hung on the back of a chair by the fire, and Aunt Chloe had another spread out before her on the table. Carefully she rubbed and ironed every fold and every hem, with the most scrupulous exactness, every now and then raising her hand to her face to wipe off the tears that were coursing down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Tom sat by, with his Testament open on his knee, and his head leaning upon his hand;&#8212;but neither spoke. It was yet early, and the children lay all asleep together in their little rude trundle-bed.</p>
<p>Tom, who had, to the full, the gentle, domestic heart, which woe for them! has been a peculiar characteristic of his unhappy race, got up and walked silently to look at his children.</p>
<p>"It's the last time," he said.</p>
<p>Aunt Chloe did not answer, only rubbed away over and over on the coarse shirt, already as smooth as hands could make it; and finally setting her iron suddenly down with a despairing plunge, she sat down to the table, and "lifted up her voice and wept."</p>
<p>"S'pose we must be resigned; but oh Lord! how ken I? If I know'd anything whar you 's goin', or how they'd sarve you! Missis says she'll try and 'deem ye, in a year or two; but Lor! nobody never comes up that goes down thar! They kills 'em! I've hearn 'em tell how dey works 'em up on dem ar plantations."</p>
<p>"There'll be the same God there, Chloe, that there is here."</p>
<p>"Well," said Aunt Chloe, "s'pose dere will; but de Lord lets drefful things happen, sometimes. I don't seem to get no comfort dat way."</p>
<p>"I'm in the Lord's hands," said Tom; "nothin' can go no furder than he lets it;&#8212;and thar's <i>one</i> thing I can thank him for. It's <i>me</i> that's sold and going down, and not you nur the chil'en. Here you're safe;&#8212;what comes will come only on me; and the Lord, he'll help me,&#8212;I know he will."</p>
<p>Ah, brave, manly heart,&#8212;smothering thine own sorrow, to comfort thy beloved ones! Tom spoke with a thick utterance, and with a bitter choking in his throat,&#8212;but he spoke brave and strong.</p>
<p>"Let's think on our marcies!" he added, tremulously, as if he was quite sure he needed to think on them very hard indeed.</p>
<p>"Marcies!" said Aunt Chloe; "don't see no marcy in 't! 'tan't right! tan't right it should be so! Mas'r never ought ter left it so that ye <i>could</i> be took for his debts. Ye've arnt him all he gets for ye, twice over. He owed ye yer freedom, and ought ter gin 't to yer years ago. Mebbe he can't help himself now, but I feel it's wrong. Nothing can't beat that ar out o' me. Sich a faithful crittur as ye've been,&#8212;and allers sot his business 'fore yer own every way,&#8212;and reckoned on him more than yer own wife and chil'en! Them as sells heart's love and heart's blood, to get out thar scrapes, de Lord'll be up to 'em!"</p>
<p>"Chloe! now, if ye love me, ye won't talk so, when perhaps jest the last time we'll ever have together! And I'll tell ye, Chloe, it goes agin me to hear one word agin Mas'r. Wan't he put in my arms a baby?&#8212;it's natur I should think a heap of him. And he couldn't be spected to think so much of poor Tom. Mas'rs is used to havin' all these yer things done for 'em, and nat'lly they don't think so much on 't. They can't be spected to, no way. Set him 'longside of other Mas'rs&#8212;who's had the treatment and livin' I've had? And he never would have let this yer come on me, if he could have seed it aforehand. I know he wouldn't."</p>
<p>"Wal, any way, thar's wrong about it <i>somewhar</i>," said Aunt Chloe, in whom a stubborn sense of justice was a predominant trait; "I can't jest make out whar 't is, but thar's wrong somewhar, I'm <i>clar</i> o' that."</p>
<p>"Yer ought ter look up to the Lord above&#8212;he's above all&#8212;thar don't a sparrow fall without him."</p>
<p>"It don't seem to comfort me, but I spect it orter," said Aunt Chloe. "But dar's no use talkin'; I'll jes wet up de corn-cake, and get ye one good breakfast, 'cause nobody knows when you'll get another."</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the sufferings of the negroes sold south, it must be remembered that all the instinctive affections of that race are peculiarly strong. Their local attachments are very abiding. They are not naturally daring and enterprising, but home-loving and affectionate. Add to this all the terrors with which ignorance invests the unknown, and add to this, again, that selling to the south is set before the negro from childhood as the last severity of punishment. The threat that terrifies more than whipping or torture of any kind is the threat of being sent down river. We have ourselves heard this feeling expressed by them, and seen the unaffected horror with which they will sit in their gossipping hours, and tell frightful stories of that "down river," which to them is</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>"That undiscovered country, from whose bourn<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; No traveller returns."</i><a id="footref-3" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-3">[3]</a><br/>
</div>
<p>A missionary figure among the fugitives in Canada told us that many of the fugitives confessed themselves to have escaped from comparatively kind masters, and that they were induced to brave the perils of escape, in almost every case, by the desperate horror with which they regarded being sold south,&#8212;a doom which was hanging either over themselves or their husbands, their wives or children. This nerves the African, naturally patient, timid and unenterprising, with heroic courage, and leads him to suffer hunger, cold, pain, the perils of the wilderness, and the more dread penalties of recapture.</p>
<p>The simple morning meal now smoked on the table, for Mrs. Shelby had excused Aunt Chloe's attendance at the great house that morning. The poor soul had expended all her little energies on this farewell feast,&#8212;had killed and dressed her choicest chicken, and prepared her corn-cake with scrupulous exactness, just to her husband's taste, and brought out certain mysterious jars on the mantel-piece, some preserves that were never produced except on extreme occasions.</p>
<p>"Lor, Pete," said Mose, triumphantly, "han't we got a buster of a breakfast!" at the same time catching at a fragment of the chicken.</p>
<p>Aunt Chloe gave him a sudden box on the ear. "Thar now! crowing over the last breakfast yer poor daddy's gwine to have to home!"</p>
<p>"O, Chloe!" said Tom, gently.</p>
<p>"Wal, I can't help it," said Aunt Chloe, hiding her face in her apron; "I 's so tossed about it, it makes me act ugly."</p>
<p>The boys stood quite still, looking first at their father and then at their mother, while the baby, climbing up her clothes, began an imperious, commanding cry.</p>
<p>"Thar!" said Aunt Chloe, wiping her eyes and taking up the baby; "now I's done, I hope,&#8212;now do eat something. This yer's my nicest chicken. Thar, boys, ye shall have some, poor critturs! Yer mammy's been cross to yer."</p>
<p>The boys needed no second invitation, and went in with great zeal for the eatables; and it was well they did so, as otherwise there would have been very little performed to any purpose by the party.</p>
<p>"Now," said Aunt Chloe, bustling about after breakfast, "I must put up yer clothes. Jest like as not, he'll take 'em all away. I know thar ways&#8212;mean as dirt, they is! Wal, now, yer flannels for rhumatis is in this corner; so be careful, 'cause there won't nobody make ye no more. Then here's yer old shirts, and these yer is new ones. I toed off these yer stockings last night, and put de ball in 'em to mend with. But Lor! who'll ever mend for ye?" and Aunt Chloe, again overcome, laid her head on the box side, and sobbed. "To think on 't! no crittur to do for ye, sick or well! I don't railly think I ought ter be good now!"</p>
<p>The boys, having eaten everything there was on the breakfast-table, began now to take some thought of the case; and, seeing their mother crying, and their father looking very sad, began to whimper and put their hands to their eyes. Uncle Tom had the baby on his knee, and was letting her enjoy herself to the utmost extent, scratching his face and pulling his hair, and occasionally breaking out into clamorous explosions of delight, evidently arising out of her own internal reflections.</p>
<p>"Ay, crow away, poor crittur!" said Aunt Chloe; "ye'll have to come to it, too! ye'll live to see yer husband sold, or mebbe be sold yerself; and these yer boys, they's to be sold, I s'pose, too, jest like as not, when dey gets good for somethin'; an't no use in niggers havin' nothin'!"</p>
<p>Here one of the boys called out, "Thar's Missis a-comin' in!"</p>
<p>"She can't do no good; what's she coming for?" said Aunt Chloe.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelby entered. Aunt Chloe set a chair for her in a manner decidedly gruff and crusty. She did not seem to notice either the action or the manner. She looked pale and anxious.</p>
<p>"Tom," she said, "I come to&#8212;" and stopping suddenly, and regarding the silent group, she sat down in the chair, and, covering her face with her handkerchief, began to sob.</p>
<p>"Lor, now, Missis, don't&#8212;don't!" said Aunt Chloe, bursting out in her turn; and for a few moments they all wept in company. And in those tears they all shed together, the high and the lowly, melted away all the heart-burnings and anger of the oppressed. O, ye who visit the distressed, do ye know that everything your money can buy, given with a cold, averted face, is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy?</p>
<p>"My good fellow," said Mrs. Shelby, "I can't give you anything to do you any good. If I give you money, it will only be taken from you. But I tell you solemnly, and before God, that I will keep trace of you, and bring you back as soon as I can command the money;&#8212;and, till then, trust in God!"</p>
<p>Here the boys called out that Mas'r Haley was coming, and then an unceremonious kick pushed open the door. Haley stood there in very ill humor, having ridden hard the night before, and being not at all pacified by his ill success in recapturing his prey.</p>
<p>"Come," said he, "ye nigger, ye'r ready? Servant, ma'am!" said he, taking off his hat, as he saw Mrs. Shelby.</p>
<p>Aunt Chloe shut and corded the box, and, getting up, looked gruffly on the trader, her tears seeming suddenly turned to sparks of fire.</p>
<p>Tom rose up meekly, to follow his new master, and raised up his heavy box on his shoulder. His wife took the baby in her arms to go with him to the wagon, and the children, still crying, trailed on behind.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelby, walking up to the trader, detained him for a few moments, talking with him in an earnest manner; and while she was thus talking, the whole family party proceeded to a wagon, that stood ready harnessed at the door. A crowd of all the old and young hands on the place stood gathered around it, to bid farewell to their old associate. Tom had been looked up to, both as a head servant and a Christian teacher, by all the place, and there was much honest sympathy and grief about him, particularly among the women.</p>
<p>"Why, Chloe, you bar it better 'n we do!" said one of the women, who had been weeping freely, noticing the gloomy calmness with which Aunt Chloe stood by the wagon.</p>
<p>"I's done <i>my</i> tears!" she said, looking grimly at the trader, who was coming up. "I does not feel to cry 'fore dat ar old limb, no how!"</p>
<p>"Get in!" said Haley to Tom, as he strode through the crowd of servants, who looked at him with lowering brows.</p>
<p>Tom got in, and Haley, drawing out from under the wagon seat a heavy pair of shackles, made them fast around each ankle.</p>
<p>A smothered groan of indignation ran through the whole circle, and Mrs. Shelby spoke from the verandah,&#8212;"Mr. Haley, I assure you that precaution is entirely unnecessary."</p>
<p>"Don' know, ma'am; I've lost one five hundred dollars from this yer place, and I can't afford to run no more risks."</p>
<p>"What else could she spect on him?" said Aunt Chloe, indignantly, while the two boys, who now seemed to comprehend at once their father's destiny, clung to her gown, sobbing and groaning vehemently.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Tom, "that Mas'r George happened to be away."</p>
<p>George had gone to spend two or three days with a companion on a neighboring estate, and having departed early in the morning, before Tom's misfortune had been made public, had left without hearing of it.</p>
<p>"Give my love to Mas'r George," he said, earnestly.</p>
<p>Haley whipped up the horse, and, with a steady, mournful look, fixed to the last on the old place, Tom was whirled away.</p>
<p>Mr. Shelby at this time was not at home. He had sold Tom under the spur of a driving necessity, to get out of the power of a man whom he dreaded,&#8212;and his first feeling, after the consummation of the bargain, had been that of relief. But his wife's expostulations awoke his half-slumbering regrets; and Tom's manly disinterestedness increased the unpleasantness of his feelings. It was in vain that he said to himself that he had a <i>right</i> to do it,&#8212;that everybody did it,&#8212;and that some did it without even the excuse of necessity;&#8212;he could not satisfy his own feelings; and that he might not witness the unpleasant scenes of the consummation, he had gone on a short business tour up the country, hoping that all would be over before he returned.</p>
<p>Tom and Haley rattled on along the dusty road, whirling past every old familiar spot, until the bounds of the estate were fairly passed, and they found themselves out on the open pike. After they had ridden about a mile, Haley suddenly drew up at the door of a blacksmith's shop, when, taking out with him a pair of handcuffs, he stepped into the shop, to have a little alteration in them.</p>
<p>"These yer 's a little too small for his build," said Haley, showing the fetters, and pointing out to Tom.</p>
<p>"Lor! now, if thar an't Shelby's Tom. He han't sold him, now?" said the smith.</p>
<p>"Yes, he has," said Haley.</p>
<p>"Now, ye don't! well, reely," said the smith, "who'd a thought it! Why, ye needn't go to fetterin' him up this yer way. He's the faithfullest, best crittur&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," said Haley; "but your good fellers are just the critturs to want ter run off. Them stupid ones, as doesn't care whar they go, and shifless, drunken ones, as don't care for nothin', they'll stick by, and like as not be rather pleased to be toted round; but these yer prime fellers, they hates it like sin. No way but to fetter 'em; got legs,&#8212;they'll use 'em,&#8212;no mistake."</p>
<p>"Well," said the smith, feeling among his tools, "them plantations down thar, stranger, an't jest the place a Kentuck nigger wants to go to; they dies thar tol'able fast, don't they?"</p>
<p>"Wal, yes, tol'able fast, ther dying is; what with the 'climating and one thing and another, they dies so as to keep the market up pretty brisk," said Haley.</p>
<p>"Wal, now, a feller can't help thinkin' it's a mighty pity to have a nice, quiet, likely feller, as good un as Tom is, go down to be fairly ground up on one of them ar sugar plantations."</p>
<p>"Wal, he's got a fa'r chance. I promised to do well by him. I'll get him in house-servant in some good old family, and then, if he stands the fever and 'climating, he'll have a berth good as any nigger ought ter ask for."</p>
<p>"He leaves his wife and chil'en up here, s'pose?"</p>
<p>"Yes; but he'll get another thar. Lord, thar's women enough everywhar," said Haley.</p>
<p>Tom was sitting very mournfully on the outside of the shop while this conversation was going on. Suddenly he heard the quick, short click of a horse's hoof behind him; and, before he could fairly awake from his surprise, young Master George sprang into the wagon, threw his arms tumultuously round his neck, and was sobbing and scolding with energy.</p>
<p>"I declare, it's real mean! I don't care what they say, any of 'em! It's a nasty, mean shame! If I was a man, they shouldn't do it,&#8212;they should not, <i>so</i>!" said George, with a kind of subdued howl.</p>
<p>"O! Mas'r George! this does me good!" said Tom. "I couldn't bar to go off without seein' ye! It does me real good, ye can't tell!" Here Tom made some movement of his feet, and George's eye fell on the fetters.</p>
<p>"What a shame!" he exclaimed, lifting his hands. "I'll knock that old fellow down&#8212;I will!"</p>
<p>"No you won't, Mas'r George; and you must not talk so loud. It won't help me any, to anger him."</p>
<p>"Well, I won't, then, for your sake; but only to think of it&#8212;isn't it a shame? They never sent for me, nor sent me any word, and, if it hadn't been for Tom Lincon, I shouldn't have heard it. I tell you, I blew 'em up well, all of 'em, at home!"</p>
<p>"That ar wasn't right, I'm 'feard, Mas'r George."</p>
<p>"Can't help it! I say it's a shame! Look here, Uncle Tom," said he, turning his back to the shop, and speaking in a mysterious tone, <i>"I've brought you my dollar!"</i></p>
<p>"O! I couldn't think o' takin' on 't, Mas'r George, no ways in the world!" said Tom, quite moved.</p>
<p>"But you <i>shall</i> take it!" said George; "look here&#8212;I told Aunt Chloe I'd do it, and she advised me just to make a hole in it, and put a string through, so you could hang it round your neck, and keep it out of sight; else this mean scamp would take it away. I tell ye, Tom, I want to blow him up! it would do me good!"</p>
<p>"No, don't Mas'r George, for it won't do <i>me</i> any good."</p>
<p>"Well, I won't, for your sake," said George, busily tying his dollar round Tom's neck; "but there, now, button your coat tight over it, and keep it, and remember, every time you see it, that I'll come down after you, and bring you back. Aunt Chloe and I have been talking about it. I told her not to fear; I'll see to it, and I'll tease father's life out, if he don't do it."</p>
<p>"O! Mas'r George, ye mustn't talk so 'bout yer father!"</p>
<p>"Lor, Uncle Tom, I don't mean anything bad."</p>
<p>"And now, Mas'r George," said Tom, "ye must be a good boy; 'member how many hearts is sot on ye. Al'ays keep close to yer mother. Don't be gettin' into any of them foolish ways boys has of gettin' too big to mind their mothers. Tell ye what, Mas'r George, the Lord gives good many things twice over; but he don't give ye a mother but once. Ye'll never see sich another woman, Mas'r George, if ye live to be a hundred years old. So, now, you hold on to her, and grow up, and be a comfort to her, thar's my own good boy,&#8212;you will now, won't ye?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I will, Uncle Tom," said George seriously.</p>
<p>"And be careful of yer speaking, Mas'r George. Young boys, when they comes to your age, is wilful, sometimes&#8212;it is natur they should be. But real gentlemen, such as I hopes you'll be, never lets fall on words that isn't 'spectful to thar parents. Ye an't 'fended, Mas'r George?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed, Uncle Tom; you always did give me good advice."</p>
<p>"I's older, ye know," said Tom, stroking the boy's fine, curly head with his large, strong hand, but speaking in a voice as tender as a woman's, "and I sees all that's bound up in you. O, Mas'r George, you has everything,&#8212;l'arnin', privileges, readin', writin',&#8212;and you'll grow up to be a great, learned, good man and all the people on the place and your mother and father'll be so proud on ye! Be a good Mas'r, like yer father; and be a Christian, like yer mother. 'Member yer Creator in the days o' yer youth, Mas'r George."</p>
<p>"I'll be <i>real</i> good, Uncle Tom, I tell you," said George. "I'm going to be a <i>first-rater</i>; and don't you be discouraged. I'll have you back to the place, yet. As I told Aunt Chloe this morning, I'll build our house all over, and you shall have a room for a parlor with a carpet on it, when I'm a man. O, you'll have good times yet!"</p>
<p>Haley now came to the door, with the handcuffs in his hands.</p>
<p>"Look here, now, Mister," said George, with an air of great superiority, as he got out, "I shall let father and mother know how you treat Uncle Tom!"</p>
<p>"You're welcome," said the trader.</p>
<p>"I should think you'd be ashamed to spend all your life buying men and women, and chaining them, like cattle! I should think you'd feel mean!" said George.</p>
<p>"So long as your grand folks wants to buy men and women, I'm as good as they is," said Haley; "'tan't any meaner sellin' on 'em, that 't is buyin'!"</p>
<p>"I'll never do either, when I'm a man," said George; "I'm ashamed, this day, that I'm a Kentuckian. I always was proud of it before;" and George sat very straight on his horse, and looked round with an air, as if he expected the state would be impressed with his opinion.</p>
<p>"Well, good-by, Uncle Tom; keep a stiff upper lip," said George.</p>
<p>"Good-by, Mas'r George," said Tom, looking fondly and admiringly at him. "God Almighty bless you! Ah! Kentucky han't got many like you!" he said, in the fulness of his heart, as the frank, boyish face was lost to his view. Away he went, and Tom looked, till the clatter of his horse's heels died away, the last sound or sight of his home. But over his heart there seemed to be a warm spot, where those young hands had placed that precious dollar. Tom put up his hand, and held it close to his heart.</p>
<p>"Now, I tell ye what, Tom," said Haley, as he came up to the wagon, and threw in the handcuffs, "I mean to start fa'r with ye, as I gen'ally do with my niggers; and I'll tell ye now, to begin with, you treat me fa'r, and I'll treat you fa'r; I an't never hard on my niggers. Calculates to do the best for 'em I can. Now, ye see, you'd better jest settle down comfortable, and not be tryin' no tricks; because nigger's tricks of all sorts I'm up to, and it's no use. If niggers is quiet, and don't try to get off, they has good times with me; and if they don't, why, it's thar fault, and not mine."</p>
<p>Tom assured Haley that he had no present intentions of running off. In fact, the exhortation seemed rather a superfluous one to a man with a great pair of iron fetters on his feet. But Mr. Haley had got in the habit of commencing his relations with his stock with little exhortations of this nature, calculated, as he deemed, to inspire cheerfulness and confidence, and prevent the necessity of any unpleasant scenes.</p>
<p>And here, for the present, we take our leave of Tom, to pursue the fortunes of other characters in our story.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00022">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00023">In Which Property Gets into an Improper State of Mind</h6>
<p>It was late in a drizzly afternoon that a traveler alighted at the door of a small country hotel, in the village of N&#8212;&#8212;, in Kentucky. In the barroom he found assembled quite a miscellaneous company, whom stress of weather had driven to harbor, and the place presented the usual scenery of such reunions. Great, tall, raw-boned Kentuckians, attired in hunting-shirts, and trailing their loose joints over a vast extent of territory, with the easy lounge peculiar to the race,&#8212;rifles stacked away in the corner, shot-pouches, game-bags, hunting-dogs, and little negroes, all rolled together in the corners,&#8212;were the characteristic features in the picture. At each end of the fireplace sat a long-legged gentleman, with his chair tipped back, his hat on his head, and the heels of his muddy boots reposing sublimely on the mantel-piece,&#8212;a position, we will inform our readers, decidedly favorable to the turn of reflection incident to western taverns, where travellers exhibit a decided preference for this particular mode of elevating their understandings.</p>
<p>Mine host, who stood behind the bar, like most of his country men, was great of stature, good-natured and loose-jointed, with an enormous shock of hair on his head, and a great tall hat on the top of that.</p>
<p>In fact, everybody in the room bore on his head this characteristic emblem of man's sovereignty; whether it were felt hat, palm-leaf, greasy beaver, or fine new chapeau, there it reposed with true republican independence. In truth, it appeared to be the characteristic mark of every individual. Some wore them tipped rakishly to one side&#8212;these were your men of humor, jolly, free-and-easy dogs; some had them jammed independently down over their noses&#8212;these were your hard characters, thorough men, who, when they wore their hats, <i>wanted</i> to wear them, and to wear them just as they had a mind to; there were those who had them set far over back&#8212;wide-awake men, who wanted a clear prospect; while careless men, who did not know, or care, how their hats sat, had them shaking about in all directions. The various hats, in fact, were quite a Shakespearean study.</p>
<p>Divers negroes, in very free-and-easy pantaloons, and with no redundancy in the shirt line, were scuttling about, hither and thither, without bringing to pass any very particular results, except expressing a generic willingness to turn over everything in creation generally for the benefit of Mas'r and his guests. Add to this picture a jolly, crackling, rollicking fire, going rejoicingly up a great wide chimney,&#8212;the outer door and every window being set wide open, and the calico window-curtain flopping and snapping in a good stiff breeze of damp raw air,&#8212;and you have an idea of the jollities of a Kentucky tavern.</p>
<p>Your Kentuckian of the present day is a good illustration of the doctrine of transmitted instincts and peculiarities. His fathers were mighty hunters,&#8212;men who lived in the woods, and slept under the free, open heavens, with the stars to hold their candles; and their descendant to this day always acts as if the house were his camp,&#8212;wears his hat at all hours, tumbles himself about, and puts his heels on the tops of chairs or mantelpieces, just as his father rolled on the green sward, and put his upon trees and logs,&#8212;keeps all the windows and doors open, winter and summer, that he may get air enough for his great lungs,&#8212;calls everybody "stranger," with nonchalant <i>bonhommie</i>, and is altogether the frankest, easiest, most jovial creature living.</p>
<p>Into such an assembly of the free and easy our traveller entered. He was a short, thick-set man, carefully dressed, with a round, good-natured countenance, and something rather fussy and particular in his appearance. He was very careful of his valise and umbrella, bringing them in with his own hands, and resisting, pertinaciously, all offers from the various servants to relieve him of them. He looked round the barroom with rather an anxious air, and, retreating with his valuables to the warmest corner, disposed them under his chair, sat down, and looked rather apprehensively up at the worthy whose heels illustrated the end of the mantel-piece, who was spitting from right to left, with a courage and energy rather alarming to gentlemen of weak nerves and particular habits.</p>
<p>"I say, stranger, how are ye?" said the aforesaid gentleman, firing an honorary salute of tobacco-juice in the direction of the new arrival.</p>
<p>"Well, I reckon," was the reply of the other, as he dodged, with some alarm, the threatening honor.</p>
<p>"Any news?" said the respondent, taking out a strip of tobacco and a large hunting-knife from his pocket.</p>
<p>"Not that I know of," said the man.</p>
<p>"Chaw?" said the first speaker, handing the old gentleman a bit of his tobacco, with a decidedly brotherly air.</p>
<p>"No, thank ye&#8212;it don't agree with me," said the little man, edging off.</p>
<p>"Don't, eh?" said the other, easily, and stowing away the morsel in his own mouth, in order to keep up the supply of tobacco-juice, for the general benefit of society.</p>
<p>The old gentleman uniformly gave a little start whenever his long-sided brother fired in his direction; and this being observed by his companion, he very good-naturedly turned his artillery to another quarter, and proceeded to storm one of the fire-irons with a degree of military talent fully sufficient to take a city.</p>
<p>"What's that?" said the old gentleman, observing some of the company formed in a group around a large handbill.</p>
<p>"Nigger advertised!" said one of the company, briefly.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson, for that was the old gentleman's name, rose up, and, after carefully adjusting his valise and umbrella, proceeded deliberately to take out his spectacles and fix them on his nose; and, this operation being performed, read as follows:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Ran away from the subscriber, my mulatto boy, George. Said<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; George six feet in height, a very light mulatto, brown curly<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; hair; is very intelligent, speaks handsomely, can read and<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; write, will probably try to pass for a white man, is deeply<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; scarred on his back and shoulders, has been branded in his<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; right hand with the letter H.<br/><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I will give four hundred dollars for him alive, and the<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; same sum for satisfactory proof that he has been <i>killed."</i>
</div>
<p>The old gentleman read this advertisement from end to end in a low voice, as if he were studying it.</p>
<p>The long-legged veteran, who had been besieging the fire-iron, as before related, now took down his cumbrous length, and rearing aloft his tall form, walked up to the advertisement and very deliberately spit a full discharge of tobacco-juice on it.</p>
<p>"There's my mind upon that!" said he, briefly, and sat down again.</p>
<p>"Why, now, stranger, what's that for?" said mine host.</p>
<p>"I'd do it all the same to the writer of that ar paper, if he was here," said the long man, coolly resuming his old employment of cutting tobacco. "Any man that owns a boy like that, and can't find any better way o' treating on him, <i>deserves</i> to lose him. Such papers as these is a shame to Kentucky; that's my mind right out, if anybody wants to know!"</p>
<p>"Well, now, that's a fact," said mine host, as he made an entry in his book.</p>
<p>"I've got a gang of boys, sir," said the long man, resuming his attack on the fire-irons, "and I jest tells 'em&#8212;'Boys,' says I,&#8212;'<i>run</i> now! dig! put! jest when ye want to! I never shall come to look after you!' That's the way I keep mine. Let 'em know they are free to run any time, and it jest breaks up their wanting to. More 'n all, I've got free papers for 'em all recorded, in case I gets keeled up any o' these times, and they know it; and I tell ye, stranger, there an't a fellow in our parts gets more out of his niggers than I do. Why, my boys have been to Cincinnati, with five hundred dollars' worth of colts, and brought me back the money, all straight, time and agin. It stands to reason they should. Treat 'em like dogs, and you'll have dogs' works and dogs' actions. Treat 'em like men, and you'll have men's works." And the honest drover, in his warmth, endorsed this moral sentiment by firing a perfect <i>feu de joi</i> at the fireplace.</p>
<p>"I think you're altogether right, friend," said Mr. Wilson; "and this boy described here <i>is</i> a fine fellow&#8212;no mistake about that. He worked for me some half-dozen years in my bagging factory, and he was my best hand, sir. He is an ingenious fellow, too: he invented a machine for the cleaning of hemp&#8212;a really valuable affair; it's gone into use in several factories. His master holds the patent of it."</p>
<p>"I'll warrant ye," said the drover, "holds it and makes money out of it, and then turns round and brands the boy in his right hand. If I had a fair chance, I'd mark him, I reckon so that he'd carry it <i>one</i> while."</p>
<p>"These yer knowin' boys is allers aggravatin' and sarcy," said a coarse-looking fellow, from the other side of the room; "that's why they gets cut up and marked so. If they behaved themselves, they wouldn't."</p>
<p>"That is to say, the Lord made 'em men, and it's a hard squeeze gettin 'em down into beasts," said the drover, dryly.</p>
<p>"Bright niggers isn't no kind of 'vantage to their masters," continued the other, well entrenched, in a coarse, unconscious obtuseness, from the contempt of his opponent; "what's the use o' talents and them things, if you can't get the use on 'em yourself? Why, all the use they make on 't is to get round you. I've had one or two of these fellers, and I jest sold 'em down river. I knew I'd got to lose 'em, first or last, if I didn't."</p>
<p>"Better send orders up to the Lord, to make you a set, and leave out their souls entirely," said the drover.</p>
<p>Here the conversation was interrupted by the approach of a small one-horse buggy to the inn. It had a genteel appearance, and a well-dressed, gentlemanly man sat on the seat, with a colored servant driving.</p>
<p>The whole party examined the new comer with the interest with which a set of loafers in a rainy day usually examine every newcomer. He was very tall, with a dark, Spanish complexion, fine, expressive black eyes, and close-curling hair, also of a glossy blackness. His well-formed aquiline nose, straight thin lips, and the admirable contour of his finely-formed limbs, impressed the whole company instantly with the idea of something uncommon. He walked easily in among the company, and with a nod indicated to his waiter where to place his trunk, bowed to the company, and, with his hat in his hand, walked up leisurely to the bar, and gave in his name as Henry Butter, Oaklands, Shelby County. Turning, with an indifferent air, he sauntered up to the advertisement, and read it over.</p>
<p>"Jim," he said to his man, "seems to me we met a boy something like this, up at Beman's, didn't we?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mas'r," said Jim, "only I an't sure about the hand."</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't look, of course," said the stranger with a careless yawn. Then walking up to the landlord, he desired him to furnish him with a private apartment, as he had some writing to do immediately.</p>
<p>The landlord was all obsequious, and a relay of about seven negroes, old and young, male and female, little and big, were soon whizzing about, like a covey of partridges, bustling, hurrying, treading on each other's toes, and tumbling over each other, in their zeal to get Mas'r's room ready, while he seated himself easily on a chair in the middle of the room, and entered into conversation with the man who sat next to him.</p>
<p>The manufacturer, Mr. Wilson, from the time of the entrance of the stranger, had regarded him with an air of disturbed and uneasy curiosity. He seemed to himself to have met and been acquainted with him somewhere, but he could not recollect. Every few moments, when the man spoke, or moved, or smiled, he would start and fix his eyes on him, and then suddenly withdraw them, as the bright, dark eyes met his with such unconcerned coolness. At last, a sudden recollection seemed to flash upon him, for he stared at the stranger with such an air of blank amazement and alarm, that he walked up to him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilson, I think," said he, in a tone of recognition, and extending his hand. "I beg your pardon, I didn't recollect you before. I see you remember me,&#8212;Mr. Butler, of Oaklands, Shelby County."</p>
<p>"Ye&#8212;yes&#8212;yes, sir," said Mr. Wilson, like one speaking in a dream.</p>
<p>Just then a negro boy entered, and announced that Mas'r's room was ready.</p>
<p>"Jim, see to the trunks," said the gentleman, negligently; then addressing himself to Mr. Wilson, he added&#8212;"I should like to have a few moments' conversation with you on business, in my room, if you please."</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson followed him, as one who walks in his sleep; and they proceeded to a large upper chamber, where a new-made fire was crackling, and various servants flying about, putting finishing touches to the arrangements.</p>
<p>When all was done, and the servants departed, the young man deliberately locked the door, and putting the key in his pocket, faced about, and folding his arms on his bosom, looked Mr. Wilson full in the face.</p>
<p>"George!" said Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p>"Yes, George," said the young man.</p>
<p>"I couldn't have thought it!"</p>
<p>"I am pretty well disguised, I fancy," said the young man, with a smile. "A little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown, and I've dyed my hair black; so you see I don't answer to the advertisement at all."</p>
<p>"O, George! but this is a dangerous game you are playing. I could not have advised you to it."</p>
<p>"I can do it on my own responsibility," said George, with the same proud smile.</p>
<p>We remark, <i>en passant</i>, that George was, by his father's side, of white descent. His mother was one of those unfortunates of her race, marked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her possessor, and the mother of children who may never know a father. From one of the proudest families in Kentucky he had inherited a set of fine European features, and a high, indomitable spirit. From his mother he had received only a slight mulatto tinge, amply compensated by its accompanying rich, dark eye. A slight change in the tint of the skin and the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the Spanish-looking fellow he then appeared; and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly manners had always been perfectly natural to him, he found no difficulty in playing the bold part he had adopted&#8212;that of a gentleman travelling with his domestic.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson, a good-natured but extremely fidgety and cautious old gentleman, ambled up and down the room, appearing, as John Bunyan hath it, "much tumbled up and down in his mind," and divided between his wish to help George, and a certain confused notion of maintaining law and order: so, as he shambled about, he delivered himself as follows:</p>
<p>"Well, George, I s'pose you're running away&#8212;leaving your lawful master, George&#8212;(I don't wonder at it)&#8212;at the same time, I'm sorry, George,&#8212;yes, decidedly&#8212;I think I must say that, George&#8212;it's my duty to tell you so."</p>
<p>"Why are you sorry, sir?" said George, calmly.</p>
<p>"Why, to see you, as it were, setting yourself in opposition to the laws of your country."</p>
<p>"<i>My</i> country!" said George, with a strong and bitter emphasis; "what country have I, but the grave,&#8212;and I wish to God that I was laid there!"</p>
<p>"Why, George, no&#8212;no&#8212;it won't do; this way of talking is wicked&#8212;unscriptural. George, you've got a hard master&#8212;in fact, he is&#8212;well he conducts himself reprehensibly&#8212;I can't pretend to defend him. But you know how the angel commanded Hagar to return to her mistress, and submit herself under the hand;<a id="footref-4" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-4">[4]</a> and the apostle sent back Onesimus to his master."<a id="footref-5" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-5">[5]</a></p>
<p>"Don't quote Bible at me that way, Mr. Wilson," said George, with a flashing eye, "don't! for my wife is a Christian, and I mean to be, if ever I get to where I can; but to quote Bible to a fellow in my circumstances, is enough to make him give it up altogether. I appeal to God Almighty;&#8212;I'm willing to go with the case to Him, and ask Him if I do wrong to seek my freedom."</p>
<p>"These feelings are quite natural, George," said the good-natured man, blowing his nose. "Yes, they're natural, but it is my duty not to encourage 'em in you. Yes, my boy, I'm sorry for you, now; it's a bad case&#8212;very bad; but the apostle says, 'Let everyone abide in the condition in which he is called.' We must all submit to the indications of Providence, George,&#8212;don't you see?"</p>
<p>George stood with his head drawn back, his arms folded tightly over his broad breast, and a bitter smile curling his lips.</p>
<p>"I wonder, Mr. Wilson, if the Indians should come and take you a prisoner away from your wife and children, and want to keep you all your life hoeing corn for them, if you'd think it your duty to abide in the condition in which you were called. I rather think that you'd think the first stray horse you could find an indication of Providence&#8212;shouldn't you?"</p>
<p>The little old gentleman stared with both eyes at this illustration of the case; but, though not much of a reasoner, he had the sense in which some logicians on this particular subject do not excel,&#8212;that of saying nothing, where nothing could be said. So, as he stood carefully stroking his umbrella, and folding and patting down all the creases in it, he proceeded on with his exhortations in a general way.</p>
<p>"You see, George, you know, now, I always have stood your friend; and whatever I've said, I've said for your good. Now, here, it seems to me, you're running an awful risk. You can't hope to carry it out. If you're taken, it will be worse with you than ever; they'll only abuse you, and half kill you, and sell you down the river."</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilson, I know all this," said George. "I <i>do</i> run a risk, but&#8212;" he threw open his overcoat, and showed two pistols and a bowie-knife. "There!" he said, "I'm ready for 'em! Down south I never <i>will</i> go. No! if it comes to that, I can earn myself at least six feet of free soil,&#8212;the first and last I shall ever own in Kentucky!"</p>
<p>"Why, George, this state of mind is awful; it's getting really desperate George. I'm concerned. Going to break the laws of your country!"</p>
<p>"My country again! Mr. Wilson, <i>you</i> have a country; but what country have <i>I</i>, or any one like me, born of slave mothers? What laws are there for us? We don't make them,&#8212;we don't consent to them,&#8212;we have nothing to do with them; all they do for us is to crush us, and keep us down. Haven't I heard your Fourth-of-July speeches? Don't you tell us all, once a year, that governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed? Can't a fellow <i>think</i>, that hears such things? Can't he put this and that together, and see what it comes to?"</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson's mind was one of those that may not unaptly be represented by a bale of cotton,&#8212;downy, soft, benevolently fuzzy and confused. He really pitied George with all his heart, and had a sort of dim and cloudy perception of the style of feeling that agitated him; but he deemed it his duty to go on talking <i>good</i> to him, with infinite pertinacity.</p>
<p>"George, this is bad. I must tell you, you know, as a friend, you'd better not be meddling with such notions; they are bad, George, very bad, for boys in your condition,&#8212;very;" and Mr. Wilson sat down to a table, and began nervously chewing the handle of his umbrella.</p>
<p>"See here, now, Mr. Wilson," said George, coming up and sitting himself determinately down in front of him; "look at me, now. Don't I sit before you, every way, just as much a man as you are? Look at my face,&#8212;look at my hands,&#8212;look at my body," and the young man drew himself up proudly; "why am I <i>not</i> a man, as much as anybody? Well, Mr. Wilson, hear what I can tell you. I had a father&#8212;one of your Kentucky gentlemen&#8212;who didn't think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his dogs and horses, to satisfy the estate, when he died. I saw my mother put up at sheriff's sale, with her seven children. They were sold before her eyes, one by one, all to different masters; and I was the youngest. She came and kneeled down before old Mas'r, and begged him to buy her with me, that she might have at least one child with her; and he kicked her away with his heavy boot. I saw him do it; and the last that I heard was her moans and screams, when I was tied to his horse's neck, to be carried off to his place."</p>
<p>"Well, then?"</p>
<p>"My master traded with one of the men, and bought my oldest sister. She was a pious, good girl,&#8212;a member of the Baptist church,&#8212;and as handsome as my poor mother had been. She was well brought up, and had good manners. At first, I was glad she was bought, for I had one friend near me. I was soon sorry for it. Sir, I have stood at the door and heard her whipped, when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart, and I couldn't do anything to help her; and she was whipped, sir, for wanting to live a decent Christian life, such as your laws give no slave girl a right to live; and at last I saw her chained with a trader's gang, to be sent to market in Orleans,&#8212;sent there for nothing else but that,&#8212;and that's the last I know of her. Well, I grew up,&#8212;long years and years,&#8212;no father, no mother, no sister, not a living soul that cared for me more than a dog; nothing but whipping, scolding, starving. Why, sir, I've been so hungry that I have been glad to take the bones they threw to their dogs; and yet, when I was a little fellow, and laid awake whole nights and cried, it wasn't the hunger, it wasn't the whipping, I cried for. No, sir, it was for <i>my mother</i> and <i>my sisters</i>,&#8212;it was because I hadn't a friend to love me on earth. I never knew what peace or comfort was. I never had a kind word spoken to me till I came to work in your factory. Mr. Wilson, you treated me well; you encouraged me to do well, and to learn to read and write, and to try to make something of myself; and God knows how grateful I am for it. Then, sir, I found my wife; you've seen her,&#8212;you know how beautiful she is. When I found she loved me, when I married her, I scarcely could believe I was alive, I was so happy; and, sir, she is as good as she is beautiful. But now what? Why, now comes my master, takes me right away from my work, and my friends, and all I like, and grinds me down into the very dirt! And why? Because, he says, I forgot who I was; he says, to teach me that I am only a nigger! After all, and last of all, he comes between me and my wife, and says I shall give her up, and live with another woman. And all this your laws give him power to do, in spite of God or man. Mr. Wilson, look at it! There isn't <i>one</i> of all these things, that have broken the hearts of my mother and my sister, and my wife and myself, but your laws allow, and give every man power to do, in Kentucky, and none can say to him nay! Do you call these the laws of <i>my</i> country? Sir, I haven't any country, anymore than I have any father. But I'm going to have one. I don't want anything of <i>your</i> country, except to be let alone,&#8212;to go peaceably out of it; and when I get to Canada, where the laws will own me and protect me, <i>that</i> shall be my country, and its laws I will obey. But if any man tries to stop me, let him take care, for I am desperate. I'll fight for my liberty to the last breath I breathe. You say your fathers did it; if it was right for them, it is right for me!"</p>
<p>This speech, delivered partly while sitting at the table, and partly walking up and down the room,&#8212;delivered with tears, and flashing eyes, and despairing gestures,&#8212;was altogether too much for the good-natured old body to whom it was addressed, who had pulled out a great yellow silk pocket-handkerchief, and was mopping up his face with great energy.</p>
<p>"Blast 'em all!" he suddenly broke out. "Haven't I always said so&#8212;the infernal old cusses! I hope I an't swearing, now. Well! go ahead, George, go ahead; but be careful, my boy; don't shoot anybody, George, unless&#8212;well&#8212;you'd <i>better</i> not shoot, I reckon; at least, I wouldn't <i>hit</i> anybody, you know. Where is your wife, George?" he added, as he nervously rose, and began walking the room.</p>
<p>"Gone, sir gone, with her child in her arms, the Lord only knows where;&#8212;gone after the north star; and when we ever meet, or whether we meet at all in this world, no creature can tell."</p>
<p>"Is it possible! astonishing! from such a kind family?"</p>
<p>"Kind families get in debt, and the laws of <i>our</i> country allow them to sell the child out of its mother's bosom to pay its master's debts," said George, bitterly.</p>
<p>"Well, well," said the honest old man, fumbling in his pocket: "I s'pose, perhaps, I an't following my judgment,&#8212;hang it, I <i>won't</i> follow my judgment!" he added, suddenly; "so here, George," and, taking out a roll of bills from his pocket-book, he offered them to George.</p>
<p>"No, my kind, good sir!" said George, "you've done a great deal for me, and this might get you into trouble. I have money enough, I hope, to take me as far as I need it."</p>
<p>"No; but you must, George. Money is a great help everywhere;&#8212;can't have too much, if you get it honestly. Take it,&#8212;<i>do</i> take it, <i>now</i>,&#8212;do, my boy!"</p>
<p>"On condition, sir, that I may repay it at some future time, I will," said George, taking up the money.</p>
<p>"And now, George, how long are you going to travel in this way?&#8212;not long or far, I hope. It's well carried on, but too bold. And this black fellow,&#8212;who is he?"</p>
<p>"A true fellow, who went to Canada more than a year ago. He heard, after he got there, that his master was so angry at him for going off that he had whipped his poor old mother; and he has come all the way back to comfort her, and get a chance to get her away."</p>
<p>"Has he got her?"</p>
<p>"Not yet; he has been hanging about the place, and found no chance yet. Meanwhile, he is going with me as far as Ohio, to put me among friends that helped him, and then he will come back after her.</p>
<p>"Dangerous, very dangerous!" said the old man.</p>
<p>George drew himself up, and smiled disdainfully.</p>
<p>The old gentleman eyed him from head to foot, with a sort of innocent wonder.</p>
<p>"George, something has brought you out wonderfully. You hold up your head, and speak and move like another man," said Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p>"Because I'm a <i>freeman</i>!" said George, proudly. "Yes, sir; I've said Mas'r for the last time to any man. <i>I'm free!"</i></p>
<p>"Take care! You are not sure,&#8212;you may be taken."</p>
<p>"All men are free and equal <i>in the grave</i>, if it comes to that, Mr. Wilson," said George.</p>
<p>"I'm perfectly dumb-founded with your boldness!" said Mr. Wilson,&#8212;"to come right here to the nearest tavern!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilson, it is <i>so</i> bold, and this tavern is so near, that they will never think of it; they will look for me on ahead, and you yourself wouldn't know me. Jim's master don't live in this county; he isn't known in these parts. Besides, he is given up; nobody is looking after him, and nobody will take me up from the advertisement, I think."</p>
<p>"But the mark in your hand?"</p>
<p>George drew off his glove, and showed a newly-healed scar in his hand.</p>
<p>"That is a parting proof of Mr. Harris' regard," he said, scornfully. "A fortnight ago, he took it into his head to give it to me, because he said he believed I should try to get away one of these days. Looks interesting, doesn't it?" he said, drawing his glove on again.</p>
<p>"I declare, my very blood runs cold when I think of it,&#8212;your condition and your risks!" said Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p>"Mine has run cold a good many years, Mr. Wilson; at present, it's about up to the boiling point," said George.</p>
<p>"Well, my good sir," continued George, after a few moments' silence, "I saw you knew me; I thought I'd just have this talk with you, lest your surprised looks should bring me out. I leave early tomorrow morning, before daylight; by tomorrow night I hope to sleep safe in Ohio. I shall travel by daylight, stop at the best hotels, go to the dinner-tables with the lords of the land. So, good-by, sir; if you hear that I'm taken, you may know that I'm dead!"</p>
<p>George stood up like a rock, and put out his hand with the air of a prince. The friendly little old man shook it heartily, and after a little shower of caution, he took his umbrella, and fumbled his way out of the room.</p>
<p>George stood thoughtfully looking at the door, as the old man closed it. A thought seemed to flash across his mind. He hastily stepped to it, and opening it, said,</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilson, one word more."</p>
<p>The old gentleman entered again, and George, as before, locked the door, and then stood for a few moments looking on the floor, irresolutely. At last, raising his head with a sudden effort&#8212;"Mr. Wilson, you have shown yourself a Christian in your treatment of me,&#8212;I want to ask one last deed of Christian kindness of you."</p>
<p>"Well, George."</p>
<p>"Well, sir,&#8212;what you said was true. I <i>am</i> running a dreadful risk. There isn't, on earth, a living soul to care if I die," he added, drawing his breath hard, and speaking with a great effort,&#8212;"I shall be kicked out and buried like a dog, and nobody'll think of it a day after,&#8212;<i>only my poor wife!</i> Poor soul! she'll mourn and grieve; and if you'd only contrive, Mr. Wilson, to send this little pin to her. She gave it to me for a Christmas present, poor child! Give it to her, and tell her I loved her to the last. Will you? <i>Will</i> you?" he added, earnestly.</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly&#8212;poor fellow!" said the old gentleman, taking the pin, with watery eyes, and a melancholy quiver in his voice.</p>
<p>"Tell her one thing," said George; "it's my last wish, if she <i>can</i> get to Canada, to go there. No matter how kind her mistress is,&#8212;no matter how much she loves her home; beg her not to go back,&#8212;for slavery always ends in misery. Tell her to bring up our boy a free man, and then he won't suffer as I have. Tell her this, Mr. Wilson, will you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, George. I'll tell her; but I trust you won't die; take heart,&#8212;you're a brave fellow. Trust in the Lord, George. I wish in my heart you were safe through, though,&#8212;that's what I do."</p>
<p>"<i>Is</i> there a God to trust in?" said George, in such a tone of bitter despair as arrested the old gentleman's words. "O, I've seen things all my life that have made me feel that there can't be a God. You Christians don't know how these things look to us. There's a God for you, but is there any for us?"</p>
<p>"O, now, don't&#8212;don't, my boy!" said the old man, almost sobbing as he spoke; "don't feel so! There is&#8212;there is; clouds and darkness are around about him, but righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. There's a <i>God</i>, George,&#8212;believe it; trust in Him, and I'm sure He'll help you. Everything will be set right,&#8212;if not in this life, in another."</p>
<p>The real piety and benevolence of the simple old man invested him with a temporary dignity and authority, as he spoke. George stopped his distracted walk up and down the room, stood thoughtfully a moment, and then said, quietly,</p>
<p>"Thank you for saying that, my good friend; I'll <i>think of that</i>."</p>
