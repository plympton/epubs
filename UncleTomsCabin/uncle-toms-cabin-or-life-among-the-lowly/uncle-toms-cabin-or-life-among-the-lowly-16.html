</div>
<p>"Blast the girl!" said Legree. "I'll choke her.&#8212;Em! Em!" he called, harshly; but only a mocking echo from the walls answered him. The sweet voice still sung on:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Parents and children there shall part!<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Parents and children there shall part!<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Shall part to meet no more!"<br/>
</div>
<p>And clear and loud swelled through the empty halls the refrain,</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "O there'll be mourning, mourning, mourning,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; O there'll be mourning, at the judgment-seat of Christ!"<br/>
</div>
<p>Legree stopped. He would have been ashamed to tell of it, but large drops of sweat stood on his forehead, his heart beat heavy and thick with fear; he even thought he saw something white rising and glimmering in the gloom before him, and shuddered to think what if the form of his dead mother should suddenly appear to him.</p>
<p>"I know one thing," he said to himself, as he stumbled back in the sitting-room, and sat down; "I'll let that fellow alone, after this! What did I want of his cussed paper? I b'lieve I am bewitched, sure enough! I've been shivering and sweating, ever since! Where did he get that hair? It couldn't have been <i>that!</i> I burnt <i>that</i> up, I know I did! It would be a joke, if hair could rise from the dead!"</p>
<p>Ah, Legree! that golden tress <i>was</i> charmed; each hair had in it a spell of terror and remorse for thee, and was used by a mightier power to bind thy cruel hands from inflicting uttermost evil on the helpless!</p>
<p>"I say," said Legree, stamping and whistling to the dogs, "wake up, some of you, and keep me company!" but the dogs only opened one eye at him, sleepily, and closed it again.</p>
<p>"I'll have Sambo and Quimbo up here, to sing and dance one of their hell dances, and keep off these horrid notions," said Legree; and, putting on his hat, he went on to the verandah, and blew a horn, with which he commonly summoned his two sable drivers.</p>
<p>Legree was often wont, when in a gracious humor, to get these two worthies into his sitting-room, and, after warming them up with whiskey, amuse himself by setting them to singing, dancing or fighting, as the humor took him.</p>
<p>It was between one and two o'clock at night, as Cassy was returning from her ministrations to poor Tom, that she heard the sound of wild shrieking, whooping, halloing, and singing, from the sitting-room, mingled with the barking of dogs, and other symptoms of general uproar.</p>
<p>She came up on the verandah steps, and looked in. Legree and both the drivers, in a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping, upsetting chairs, and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces at each other.</p>
<p>She rested her small, slender hand on the window-blind, and looked fixedly at them;&#8212;there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce bitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so. "Would it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch?" she said to herself.</p>
<p>She turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up stairs, and tapped at Emmeline's door.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00073">CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00074">Emmeline and Cassy</h6>
<p>Cassy entered the room, and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear, in the furthest corner of it. As she came in, the girl started up nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her arm, said, "O Cassy, is it you? I'm so glad you've come! I was afraid it was&#8212;. O, you don't know what a horrid noise there has been, down stairs, all this evening!"</p>
<p>"I ought to know," said Cassy, dryly. "I've heard it often enough."</p>
<p>"O Cassy! do tell me,&#8212;couldn't we get away from this place? I don't care where,&#8212;into the swamp among the snakes,&#8212;anywhere! <i>Couldn't</i> we get <i>somewhere</i> away from here?"</p>
<p>"Nowhere, but into our graves," said Cassy.</p>
<p>"Did you ever try?"</p>
<p>"I've seen enough of trying and what comes of it," said Cassy.</p>
<p>"I'd be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees. I an't afraid of snakes! I'd rather have one near me than him," said Emmeline, eagerly.</p>
<p>"There have been a good many here of your opinion," said Cassy; "but you couldn't stay in the swamps,&#8212;you'd be tracked by the dogs, and brought back, and then&#8212;then&#8212;"</p>
<p>"What would he do?" said the girl, looking, with breathless interest, into her face.</p>
<p>"What <i>wouldn't</i> he do, you'd better ask," said Cassy. "He's learned his trade well, among the pirates in the West Indies. You wouldn't sleep much, if I should tell you things I've seen,&#8212;things that he tells of, sometimes, for good jokes. I've heard screams here that I haven't been able to get out of my head for weeks and weeks. There's a place way out down by the quarters, where you can see a black, blasted tree, and the ground all covered with black ashes. Ask anyone what was done there, and see if they will dare to tell you."</p>
<p>"O! what do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I won't tell you. I hate to think of it. And I tell you, the Lord only knows what we may see tomorrow, if that poor fellow holds out as he's begun."</p>
<p>"Horrid!" said Emmeline, every drop of blood receding from her cheeks. "O, Cassy, do tell me what I shall do!"</p>
<p>"What I've done. Do the best you can,&#8212;do what you must,&#8212;and make it up in hating and cursing."</p>
<p>"He wanted to make me drink some of his hateful brandy," said Emmeline; "and I hate it so&#8212;"</p>
<p>"You'd better drink," said Cassy. "I hated it, too; and now I can't live without it. One must have something;&#8212;things don't look so dreadful, when you take that."</p>
<p>"Mother used to tell me never to touch any such thing," said Emmeline.</p>
<p>"<i>Mother</i> told you!" said Cassy, with a thrilling and bitter emphasis on the word mother. "What use is it for mothers to say anything? You are all to be bought and paid for, and your souls belong to whoever gets you. That's the way it goes. I say, <i>drink</i> brandy; drink all you can, and it'll make things come easier."</p>
<p>"O, Cassy! do pity me!"</p>
<p>"Pity you!&#8212;don't I? Haven't I a daughter,&#8212;Lord knows where she is, and whose she is, now,&#8212;going the way her mother went, before her, I suppose, and that her children must go, after her! There's no end to the curse&#8212;forever!"</p>
<p>"I wish I'd never been born!" said Emmeline, wringing her hands.</p>
<p>"That's an old wish with me," said Cassy. "I've got used to wishing that. I'd die, if I dared to," she said, looking out into the darkness, with that still, fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her face when at rest.</p>
<p>"It would be wicked to kill one's self," said Emmeline.</p>
<p>"I don't know why,&#8212;no wickeder than things we live and do, day after day. But the sisters told me things, when I was in the convent, that make me afraid to die. If it would only be the end of us, why, then&#8212;"</p>
<p>Emmeline turned away, and hid her face in her hands.</p>
<p>While this conversation was passing in the chamber, Legree, overcome with his carouse, had sunk to sleep in the room below. Legree was not an habitual drunkard. His coarse, strong nature craved, and could endure, a continual stimulation, that would have utterly wrecked and crazed a finer one. But a deep, underlying spirit of cautiousness prevented his often yielding to appetite in such measure as to lose control of himself.</p>
<p>This night, however, in his feverish efforts to banish from his mind those fearful elements of woe and remorse which woke within him, he had indulged more than common; so that, when he had discharged his sable attendants, he fell heavily on a settle in the room, and was sound asleep.</p>
<p>O! how dares the bad soul to enter the shadowy world of sleep?&#8212;that land whose dim outlines lie so fearfully near to the mystic scene of retribution! Legree dreamed. In his heavy and feverish sleep, a veiled form stood beside him, and laid a cold, soft hand upon him. He thought he knew who it was; and shuddered, with creeping horror, though the face was veiled. Then he thought he felt <i>that hair</i> twining round his fingers; and then, that it slid smoothly round his neck, and tightened and tightened, and he could not draw his breath; and then he thought voices <i>whispered</i> to him,&#8212;whispers that chilled him with horror. Then it seemed to him he was on the edge of a frightful abyss, holding on and struggling in mortal fear, while dark hands stretched up, and were pulling him over; and Cassy came behind him laughing, and pushed him. And then rose up that solemn veiled figure, and drew aside the veil. It was his mother; and she turned away from him, and he fell down, down, down, amid a confused noise of shrieks, and groans, and shouts of demon laughter,&#8212;and Legree awoke.</p>
<p>Calmly the rosy hue of dawn was stealing into the room. The morning star stood, with its solemn, holy eye of light, looking down on the man of sin, from out the brightening sky. O, with what freshness, what solemnity and beauty, is each new day born; as if to say to insensate man, "Behold! thou hast one more chance! <i>Strive</i> for immortal glory!" There is no speech nor language where this voice is not heard; but the bold, bad man heard it not. He woke with an oath and a curse. What to him was the gold and purple, the daily miracle of morning! What to him the sanctity of the star which the Son of God has hallowed as his own emblem? Brute-like, he saw without perceiving; and, stumbling forward, poured out a tumbler of brandy, and drank half of it.</p>
<p>"I've had a h&#8212;l of a night!" he said to Cassy, who just then entered from an opposite door.</p>
<p>"You'll get plenty of the same sort, by and by," said she, dryly.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, you minx?"</p>
<p>"You'll find out, one of these days," returned Cassy, in the same tone. "Now Simon, I've one piece of advice to give you."</p>
<p>"The devil, you have!"</p>
<p>"My advice is," said Cassy, steadily, as she began adjusting some things about the room, "that you let Tom alone."</p>
<p>"What business is 't of yours?"</p>
<p>"What? To be sure, I don't know what it should be. If you want to pay twelve hundred for a fellow, and use him right up in the press of the season, just to serve your own spite, it's no business of mine, I've done what I could for him."</p>
<p>"You have? What business have you meddling in my matters?"</p>
<p>"None, to be sure. I've saved you some thousands of dollars, at different times, by taking care of your hands,&#8212;that's all the thanks I get. If your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs, you won't lose your bet, I suppose? Tompkins won't lord it over you, I suppose,&#8212;and you'll pay down your money like a lady, won't you? I think I see you doing it!"</p>
<p>Legree, like many other planters, had but one form of ambition,&#8212;to have in the heaviest crop of the season,&#8212;and he had several bets on this very present season pending in the next town. Cassy, therefore, with woman's tact, touched the only string that could be made to vibrate.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll let him off at what he's got," said Legree; "but he shall beg my pardon, and promise better fashions."</p>
<p>"That he won't do," said Cassy.</p>
<p>"Won't,&#8212;eh?"</p>
<p>"No, he won't," said Cassy.</p>
<p>"I'd like to know <i>why</i>, Mistress," said Legree, in the extreme of scorn.</p>
<p>"Because he's done right, and he knows it, and won't say he's done wrong."</p>
<p>"Who a cuss cares what he knows? The nigger shall say what I please, or&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Or, you'll lose your bet on the cotton crop, by keeping him out of the field, just at this very press."</p>
<p>"But he <i>will</i> give up,&#8212;course, he will; don't I know what niggers is? He'll beg like a dog, this morning."</p>
<p>"He won't, Simon; you don't know this kind. You may kill him by inches,&#8212;you won't get the first word of confession out of him."</p>
<p>"We'll see,&#8212;where is he?" said Legree, going out.</p>
<p>"In the waste-room of the gin-house," said Cassy.</p>
<p>Legree, though he talked so stoutly to Cassy, still sallied forth from the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him. His dreams of the past night, mingled with Cassy's prudential suggestions, considerably affected his mind. He resolved that nobody should be witness of his encounter with Tom; and determined, if he could not subdue him by bullying, to defer his vengeance, to be wreaked in a more convenient season.</p>
<p>The solemn light of dawn&#8212;the angelic glory of the morning-star&#8212;had looked in through the rude window of the shed where Tom was lying; and, as if descending on that star-beam, came the solemn words, "I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star." The mysterious warnings and intimations of Cassy, so far from discouraging his soul, in the end had roused it as with a heavenly call. He did not know but that the day of his death was dawning in the sky; and his heart throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire, as he thought that the wondrous <i>all</i>, of which he had often pondered,&#8212;the great white throne, with its ever radiant rainbow; the white-robed multitude, with voices as many waters; the crowns, the palms, the harps,&#8212;might all break upon his vision before that sun should set again. And, therefore, without shuddering or trembling, he heard the voice of his persecutor, as he drew near.</p>
<p>"Well, my boy," said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, "how do you find yourself? Didn't I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two? How do yer like it&#8212;eh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? An't quite so crank as ye was last night. Ye couldn't treat a poor sinner, now, to a bit of sermon, could ye,&#8212;eh?"</p>
<p>Tom answered nothing.</p>
<p>"Get up, you beast!" said Legree, kicking him again.</p>
<p>This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally.</p>
<p>"What makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last night."</p>
<p>Tom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master with a steady, unmoved front.</p>
<p>"The devil, you can!" said Legree, looking him over. "I believe you haven't got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon, for yer shines last night."</p>
<p>Tom did not move.</p>
<p>"Down, you dog!" said Legree, striking him with his riding-whip.</p>
<p>"Mas'r Legree," said Tom, "I can't do it. I did only what I thought was right. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will do a cruel thing, come what may."</p>
<p>"Yes, but ye don't know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what you've got is something. I tell you 'tan't anything,&#8212;nothing 't all. How would ye like to be tied to a tree, and have a slow fire lit up around ye;&#8212;wouldn't that be pleasant,&#8212;eh, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Mas'r," said Tom, "I know ye can do dreadful things; but,"&#8212;he stretched himself upward and clasped his hands,&#8212;"but, after ye've killed the body, there an't no more ye can do. And O, there's all ETERNITY to come, after that!"</p>
<p>ETERNITY,&#8212;the word thrilled through the black man's soul with light and power, as he spoke; it thrilled through the sinner's soul, too, like the bite of a scorpion. Legree gnashed on him with his teeth, but rage kept him silent; and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear and cheerful voice,</p>
<p>"Mas'r Legree, as ye bought me, I'll be a true and faithful servant to ye. I'll give ye all the work of my hands, all my time, all my strength; but my soul I won't give up to mortal man. I will hold on to the Lord, and put his commands before all,&#8212;die or live; you may be sure on 't. Mas'r Legree, I ain't a grain afeard to die. I'd as soon die as not. Ye may whip me, starve me, burn me,&#8212;it'll only send me sooner where I want to go."</p>
<p>"I'll make ye give out, though, 'fore I've done!" said Legree, in a rage.</p>
<p>"I shall have <i>help</i>," said Tom; "you'll never do it."</p>
<p>"Who the devil's going to help you?" said Legree, scornfully.</p>
<p>"The Lord Almighty," said Tom.</p>
<p>"D&#8212;n you!" said Legree, as with one blow of his fist he felled Tom to the earth.</p>
<p>A cold soft hand fell on Legree's at this moment. He turned,&#8212;it was Cassy's; but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before, and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the fearful images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that accompanied them.</p>
<p>"Will you be a fool?" said Cassy, in French. "Let him go! Let me alone to get him fit to be in the field again. Isn't it just as I told you?"</p>
<p>They say the alligator, the rhinoceros, though enclosed in bullet-proof mail, have each a spot where they are vulnerable; and fierce, reckless, unbelieving reprobates, have commonly this point in superstitious dread.</p>
<p>Legree turned away, determined to let the point go for the time.</p>
<p>"Well, have it your own way," he said, doggedly, to Cassy.</p>
<p>"Hark, ye!" he said to Tom; "I won't deal with ye now, because the business is pressing, and I want all my hands; but I <i>never</i> forget. I'll score it against ye, and sometime I'll have my pay out o' yer old black hide,&#8212;mind ye!"</p>
<p>Legree turned, and went out.</p>
<p>"There you go," said Cassy, looking darkly after him; "your reckoning's to come, yet!&#8212;My poor fellow, how are you?"</p>
<p>"The Lord God hath sent his angel, and shut the lion's mouth, for this time," said Tom.</p>
<p>"For this time, to be sure," said Cassy; "but now you've got his ill will upon you, to follow you day in, day out, hanging like a dog on your throat,&#8212;sucking your blood, bleeding away your life, drop by drop. I know the man."</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00075">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00076">Liberty</h6>
<div class="intro">"No matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of slavery, the moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the altar and the God sink together in the dust, and he stands redeemed, regenerated, and disenthralled, by the irresistible genius of universal emancipation." CURRAN.<a id="footref-24" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-24">[24]</a></div>
<p>A while we must leave Tom in the hands of his persecutors, while we turn to pursue the fortunes of George and his wife, whom we left in friendly hands, in a farmhouse on the road-side.</p>
<p>Tom Loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean Quaker bed, under the motherly supervision of Aunt Dorcas, who found him to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison.</p>
<p>Imagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap shades waves of silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which overarches thoughtful gray eyes. A snowy handkerchief of lisse crape is folded neatly across her bosom; her glossy brown silk dress rustles peacefully, as she glides up and down the chamber.</p>
<p>"The devil!" says Tom Loker, giving a great throw to the bedclothes.</p>
<p>"I must request thee, Thomas, not to use such language," says Aunt Dorcas, as she quietly rearranged the bed.</p>
<p>"Well, I won't, granny, if I can help it," says Tom; "but it is enough to make a fellow swear,&#8212;so cursedly hot!"</p>
<p>Dorcas removed a comforter from the bed, straightened the clothes again, and tucked them in till Tom looked something like a chrysalis; remarking, as she did so,</p>
<p>"I wish, friend, thee would leave off cursing and swearing, and think upon thy ways."</p>
<p>"What the devil," said Tom, "should I think of <i>them</i> for? Last thing ever <i>I</i> want to think of&#8212;hang it all!" And Tom flounced over, untucking and disarranging everything, in a manner frightful to behold.</p>
<p>"That fellow and gal are here, I s'pose," said he, sullenly, after a pause.</p>
<p>"They are so," said Dorcas.</p>
<p>"They'd better be off up to the lake," said Tom; "the quicker the better."</p>
<p>"Probably they will do so," said Aunt Dorcas, knitting peacefully.</p>
<p>"And hark ye," said Tom; "we've got correspondents in Sandusky, that watch the boats for us. I don't care if I tell, now. I hope they <i>will</i> get away, just to spite Marks,&#8212;the cursed puppy!&#8212;d&#8212;n him!"</p>
<p>"Thomas!" said Dorcas.</p>
<p>"I tell you, granny, if you bottle a fellow up too tight, I shall split," said Tom. "But about the gal,&#8212;tell 'em to dress her up some way, so's to alter her. Her description's out in Sandusky."</p>
<p>"We will attend to that matter," said Dorcas, with characteristic composure.</p>
<p>As we at this place take leave of Tom Loker, we may as well say, that, having lain three weeks at the Quaker dwelling, sick with a rheumatic fever, which set in, in company with his other afflictions, Tom arose from his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man; and, in place of slave-catching, betook himself to life in one of the new settlements, where his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears, wolves, and other inhabitants of the forest, in which he made himself quite a name in the land. Tom always spoke reverently of the Quakers. "Nice people," he would say; "wanted to convert me, but couldn't come it, exactly. But, tell ye what, stranger, they do fix up a sick fellow first rate,&#8212;no mistake. Make jist the tallest kind o' broth and knicknacks."</p>
<p>As Tom had informed them that their party would be looked for in Sandusky, it was thought prudent to divide them. Jim, with his old mother, was forwarded separately; and a night or two after, George and Eliza, with their child, were driven privately into Sandusky, and lodged beneath a hospital roof, preparatory to taking their last passage on the lake.</p>
<p>Their night was now far spent, and the morning star of liberty rose fair before them!&#8212;electric word! What is it? Is there anything more in it than a name&#8212;a rhetorical flourish? Why, men and women of America, does your heart's blood thrill at that word, for which your fathers bled, and your braver mothers were willing that their noblest and best should die?</p>
<p>Is there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation, that is not also glorious and dear for a man? What is freedom to a nation, but freedom to the individuals in it? What is freedom to that young man, who sits there, with his arms folded over his broad chest, the tint of African blood in his cheek, its dark fires in his eyes,&#8212;what is freedom to George Harris? To your fathers, freedom was the right of a nation to be a nation. To him, it is the right of a man to be a man, and not a brute; the right to call the wife of his bosom his wife, and to protect her from lawless violence; the right to protect and educate his child; the right to have a home of his own, a religion of his own, a character of his own, unsubject to the will of another. All these thoughts were rolling and seething in George's breast, as he was pensively leaning his head on his hand, watching his wife, as she was adapting to her slender and pretty form the articles of man's attire, in which it was deemed safest she should make her escape.</p>
<p>"Now for it," said she, as she stood before the glass, and shook down her silky abundance of black curly hair. "I say, George, it's almost a pity, isn't it," she said, as she held up some of it, playfully,&#8212;"pity it's all got to come off?"</p>
<p>George smiled sadly, and made no answer.</p>
<p>Eliza turned to the glass, and the scissors glittered as one long lock after another was detached from her head.</p>
<p>"There, now, that'll do," she said, taking up a hair-brush; "now for a few fancy touches."</p>
<p>"There, an't I a pretty young fellow?" she said, turning around to her husband, laughing and blushing at the same time.</p>
<p>"You always will be pretty, do what you will," said George.</p>
<p>"What does make you so sober?" said Eliza, kneeling on one knee, and laying her hand on his. "We are only within twenty-four hours of Canada, they say. Only a day and a night on the lake, and then&#8212;oh, then!&#8212;"</p>
<p>"O, Eliza!" said George, drawing her towards him; "that is it! Now my fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in sight, and then lose all. I should never live under it, Eliza."</p>
<p>"Don't fear," said his wife, hopefully. "The good Lord would not have brought us so far, if he didn't mean to carry us through. I seem to feel him with us, George."</p>
<p>"You are a blessed woman, Eliza!" said George, clasping her with a convulsive grasp. "But,&#8212;oh, tell me! can this great mercy be for us? Will these years and years of misery come to an end?&#8212;shall we be free?</p>
<p>"I am sure of it, George," said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. "I feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day."</p>
<p>"I will believe you, Eliza," said George, rising suddenly up, "I will believe,&#8212;come let's be off. Well, indeed," said he, holding her off at arm's length, and looking admiringly at her, "you <i>are</i> a pretty little fellow. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your cap. So&#8212;a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it's almost time for the carriage;&#8212;I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?"</p>
<p>The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl's clothes.</p>
<p>"What a pretty girl he makes," said Eliza, turning him round. "We call him Harriet, you see;&#8212;don't the name come nicely?"</p>
<p>The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls.</p>
<p>"Does Harry know mamma?" said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him.</p>
<p>The child clung shyly to the woman.</p>
<p>"Come Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got to be kept away from you?"</p>
<p>"I know it's foolish," said Eliza; "yet, I can't bear to have him turn away from me. But come,&#8212;where's my cloak? Here,&#8212;how is it men put on cloaks, George?"</p>
<p>"You must wear it so," said her husband, throwing it over his shoulders.</p>
<p>"So, then," said Eliza, imitating the motion,&#8212;"and I must stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy."</p>
<p>"Don't exert yourself," said George. "There is, now and then, a modest young man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that character."</p>
<p>"And these gloves! mercy upon us!" said Eliza; "why, my hands are lost in them."</p>
<p>"I advise you to keep them on pretty strictly," said George. "Your slender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be our aunty,&#8212;you mind."</p>
<p>"I've heard," said Mrs. Smyth, "that there have been men down, warning all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy."</p>
<p>"They have!" said George. "Well, if we see any such people, we can tell them."</p>
<p>A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings.</p>
<p>The disguises the party had assumed were in accordance with the hints of Tom Loker. Mrs. Smyth, a respectable woman from the settlement in Canada, whither they were fleeing, being fortunately about crossing the lake to return thither, had consented to appear as the aunt of little Harry; and, in order to attach him to her, he had been allowed to remain, the two last days, under her sole charge; and an extra amount of petting, jointed to an indefinite amount of seed-cakes and candy, had cemented a very close attachment on the part of the young gentleman.</p>
<p>The hack drove to the wharf. The two young men, as they appeared, walked up the plank into the boat, Eliza gallantly giving her arm to Mrs. Smyth, and George attending to their baggage.</p>
<p>George was standing at the captain's office, settling for his party, when he overheard two men talking by his side.</p>
<p>"I've watched every one that came on board," said one, "and I know they're not on this boat."</p>
<p>The voice was that of the clerk of the boat. The speaker whom he addressed was our sometime friend Marks, who, with that valuable perseverance which characterized him, had come on to Sandusky, seeking whom he might devour.</p>
<p>"You would scarcely know the woman from a white one," said Marks. "The man is a very light mulatto; he has a brand in one of his hands."</p>
<p>The hand with which George was taking the tickets and change trembled a little; but he turned coolly around, fixed an unconcerned glance on the face of the speaker, and walked leisurely toward another part of the boat, where Eliza stood waiting for him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smyth, with little Harry, sought the seclusion of the ladies' cabin, where the dark beauty of the supposed little girl drew many flattering comments from the passengers.</p>
<p>George had the satisfaction, as the bell rang out its farewell peal, to see Marks walk down the plank to the shore; and drew a long sigh of relief, when the boat had put a returnless distance between them.</p>
<p>It was a superb day. The blue waves of Lake Erie danced, rippling and sparkling, in the sun-light. A fresh breeze blew from the shore, and the lordly boat ploughed her way right gallantly onward.</p>
<p>O, what an untold world there is in one human heart! Who thought, as George walked calmly up and down the deck of the steamer, with his shy companion at his side, of all that was burning in his bosom? The mighty good that seemed approaching seemed too good, too fair, even to be a reality; and he felt a jealous dread, every moment of the day, that something would rise to snatch it from him.</p>
<p>But the boat swept on. Hours fleeted, and, at last, clear and full rose the blessed English shores; shores charmed by a mighty spell,&#8212;with one touch to dissolve every incantation of slavery, no matter in what language pronounced, or by what national power confirmed.</p>
<p>George and his wife stood arm in arm, as the boat neared the small town of Amherstberg, in Canada. His breath grew thick and short; a mist gathered before his eyes; he silently pressed the little hand that lay trembling on his arm. The bell rang; the boat stopped. Scarcely seeing what he did, he looked out his baggage, and gathered his little party. The little company were landed on the shore. They stood still till the boat had cleared; and then, with tears and embracings, the husband and wife, with their wondering child in their arms, knelt down and lifted up their hearts to God!</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "'T was something like the burst from death to life;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From the grave's cerements to the robes of heaven;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From sin's dominion, and from passion's strife,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To the pure freedom of a soul forgiven;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Where all the bonds of death and hell are riven,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And mortal puts on immortality,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When Mercy's hand hath turned the golden key,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And Mercy's voice hath said, <i>Rejoice, thy soul is free."</i>
</div>
<p>The little party were soon guided, by Mrs. Smyth, to the hospitable abode of a good missionary, whom Christian charity has placed here as a shepherd to the outcast and wandering, who are constantly finding an asylum on this shore.</p>
<p>Who can speak the blessedness of that first day of freedom? Is not the <i>sense</i> of liberty a higher and a finer one than any of the five? To move, speak and breathe,&#8212;go out and come in unwatched, and free from danger! Who can speak the blessings of that rest which comes down on the free man's pillow, under laws which insure to him the rights that God has given to man? How fair and precious to that mother was that sleeping child's face, endeared by the memory of a thousand dangers! How impossible was it to sleep, in the exuberant possession of such blessedness! And yet, these two had not one acre of ground,&#8212;not a roof that they could call their own,&#8212;they had spent their all, to the last dollar. They had nothing more than the birds of the air, or the flowers of the field,&#8212;yet they could not sleep for joy. "O, ye who take freedom from man, with what words shall ye answer it to God?"</p>

<h6 id="dlepubid00078">The Victory</h6>
<div class="intro">"Thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory."<a id="footref-25" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-25">[25]</a></div>
<p>Have not many of us, in the weary way of life, felt, in some hours, how far easier it were to die than to live?</p>
<p>The martyr, when faced even by a death of bodily anguish and horror, finds in the very terror of his doom a strong stimulant and tonic. There is a vivid excitement, a thrill and fervor, which may carry through any crisis of suffering that is the birth-hour of eternal glory and rest.</p>
<p>But to live,&#8212;to wear on, day after day, of mean, bitter, low, harassing servitude, every nerve dampened and depressed, every power of feeling gradually smothered,&#8212;this long and wasting heart-martyrdom, this slow, daily bleeding away of the inward life, drop by drop, hour after hour,&#8212;this is the true searching test of what there may be in man or woman.</p>
<p>When Tom stood face to face with his persecutor, and heard his threats, and thought in his very soul that his hour was come, his heart swelled bravely in him, and he thought he could bear torture and fire, bear anything, with the vision of Jesus and heaven but just a step beyond; but, when he was gone, and the present excitement passed off, came back the pain of his bruised and weary limbs,&#8212;came back the sense of his utterly degraded, hopeless, forlorn estate; and the day passed wearily enough.</p>
<p>Long before his wounds were healed, Legree insisted that he should be put to the regular field-work; and then came day after day of pain and weariness, aggravated by every kind of injustice and indignity that the ill-will of a mean and malicious mind could devise. Whoever, in <i>our</i> circumstances, has made trial of pain, even with all the alleviations which, for us, usually attend it, must know the irritation that comes with it. Tom no longer wondered at the habitual surliness of his associates; nay, he found the placid, sunny temper, which had been the habitude of his life, broken in on, and sorely strained, by the inroads of the same thing. He had flattered himself on leisure to read his Bible; but there was no such thing as leisure there. In the height of the season, Legree did not hesitate to press all his hands through, Sundays and week-days alike. Why shouldn't he?&#8212;he made more cotton by it, and gained his wager; and if it wore out a few more hands, he could buy better ones. At first, Tom used to read a verse or two of his Bible, by the flicker of the fire, after he had returned from his daily toil; but, after the cruel treatment he received, he used to come home so exhausted, that his head swam and his eyes failed when he tried to read; and he was fain to stretch himself down, with the others, in utter exhaustion.</p>
<p>Is it strange that the religious peace and trust, which had upborne him hitherto, should give way to tossings of soul and despondent darkness? The gloomiest problem of this mysterious life was constantly before his eyes,&#8212;souls crushed and ruined, evil triumphant, and God silent. It was weeks and months that Tom wrestled, in his own soul, in darkness and sorrow. He thought of Miss Ophelia's letter to his Kentucky friends, and would pray earnestly that God would send him deliverance. And then he would watch, day after day, in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent to redeem him; and, when nobody came, he would crush back to his soul bitter thoughts,&#8212;that it was vain to serve God, that God had forgotten him. He sometimes saw Cassy; and sometimes, when summoned to the house, caught a glimpse of the dejected form of Emmeline, but held very little communion with either; in fact, there was no time for him to commune with anybody.</p>
<p>One evening, he was sitting, in utter dejection and prostration, by a few decaying brands, where his coarse supper was baking. He put a few bits of brushwood on the fire, and strove to raise the light, and then drew his worn Bible from his pocket. There were all the marked passages, which had thrilled his soul so often,&#8212;words of patriarchs and seers, poets and sages, who from early time had spoken courage to man,&#8212;voices from the great cloud of witnesses who ever surround us in the race of life. Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration? Heavily sighing, he put it in his pocket. A coarse laugh roused him; he looked up,&#8212;Legree was standing opposite to him.</p>
<p>"Well, old boy," he said, "you find your religion don't work, it seems! I thought I should get that through your wool, at last!"</p>
<p>The cruel taunt was more than hunger and cold and nakedness. Tom was silent.</p>
<p>"You were a fool," said Legree; "for I meant to do well by you, when I bought you. You might have been better off than Sambo, or Quimbo either, and had easy times; and, instead of getting cut up and thrashed, every day or two, ye might have had liberty to lord it round, and cut up the other niggers; and ye might have had, now and then, a good warming of whiskey punch. Come, Tom, don't you think you'd better be reasonable?&#8212;heave that ar old pack of trash in the fire, and join my church!"</p>
<p>"The Lord forbid!" said Tom, fervently.</p>
<p>"You see the Lord an't going to help you; if he had been, he wouldn't have let <i>me</i> get you! This yer religion is all a mess of lying trumpery, Tom. I know all about it. Ye'd better hold to me; I'm somebody, and can do something!"</p>
<p>"No, Mas'r," said Tom; "I'll hold on. The Lord may help me, or not help; but I'll hold to him, and believe him to the last!"</p>
<p>"The more fool you!" said Legree, spitting scornfully at him, and spurning him with his foot. "Never mind; I'll chase you down, yet, and bring you under,&#8212;you'll see!" and Legree turned away.</p>
<p>When a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level at which endurance is possible, there is an instant and desperate effort of every physical and moral nerve to throw off the weight; and hence the heaviest anguish often precedes a return tide of joy and courage. So was it now with Tom. The atheistic taunts of his cruel master sunk his before dejected soul to the lowest ebb; and, though the hand of faith still held to the eternal rock, it was a numb, despairing grasp. Tom sat, like one stunned, at the fire. Suddenly everything around him seemed to fade, and a vision rose before him of one crowned with thorns, buffeted and bleeding. Tom gazed, in awe and wonder, at the majestic patience of the face; the deep, pathetic eyes thrilled him to his inmost heart; his soul woke, as, with floods of emotion, he stretched out his hands and fell upon his knees,&#8212;when, gradually, the vision changed: the sharp thorns became rays of glory; and, in splendor inconceivable, he saw that same face bending compassionately towards him, and a voice said, "He that overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne, even as I also overcome, and am set down with my Father on his throne."</p>
<p>How long Tom lay there, he knew not. When he came to himself, the fire was gone out, his clothes were wet with the chill and drenching dews; but the dread soul-crisis was past, and, in the joy that filled him, he no longer felt hunger, cold, degradation, disappointment, wretchedness. From his deepest soul, he that hour loosed and parted from every hope in life that now is, and offered his own will an unquestioning sacrifice to the Infinite. Tom looked up to the silent, ever-living stars,&#8212;types of the angelic hosts who ever look down on man; and the solitude of the night rung with the triumphant words of a hymn, which he had sung often in happier days, but never with such feeling as now:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160; "The earth shall be dissolved like snow,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The sun shall cease to shine;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But God, who called me here below,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Shall be forever mine.<br/><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; "And when this mortal life shall fail,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And flesh and sense shall cease,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I shall possess within the veil<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A life of joy and peace.<br/><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; "When we've been there ten thousand years,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bright shining like the sun,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We've no less days to sing God's praise<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Than when we first begun."<br/>
</div>
<p>Those who have been familiar with the religious histories of the slave population know that relations like what we have narrated are very common among them. We have heard some from their own lips, of a very touching and affecting character. The psychologist tells us of a state, in which the affections and images of the mind become so dominant and overpowering, that they press into their service the outward imagining. Who shall measure what an all-pervading Spirit may do with these capabilities of our mortality, or the ways in which He may encourage the desponding souls of the desolate? If the poor forgotten slave believes that Jesus hath appeared and spoken to him, who shall contradict him? Did He not say that his mission, in all ages, was to bind up the broken-hearted, and set at liberty them that are bruised?</p>
<p>When the dim gray of dawn woke the slumberers to go forth to the field, there was among those tattered and shivering wretches one who walked with an exultant tread; for firmer than the ground he trod on was his strong faith in Almighty, eternal love. Ah, Legree, try all your forces now! Utmost agony, woe, degradation, want, and loss of all things, shall only hasten on the process by which he shall be made a king and a priest unto God!</p>
<p>From this time, an inviolable sphere of peace encompassed the lowly heart of the oppressed one,&#8212;an ever-present Saviour hallowed it as a temple. Past now the bleeding of earthly regrets; past its fluctuations of hope, and fear, and desire; the human will, bent, and bleeding, and struggling long, was now entirely merged in the Divine. So short now seemed the remaining voyage of life,&#8212;so near, so vivid, seemed eternal blessedness,&#8212;that life's uttermost woes fell from him unharming.</p>
<p>All noticed the change in his appearance. Cheerfulness and alertness seemed to return to him, and a quietness which no insult or injury could ruffle seemed to possess him.</p>
<p>"What the devil's got into Tom?" Legree said to Sambo. "A while ago he was all down in the mouth, and now he's peart as a cricket."</p>
<p>"Dunno, Mas'r; gwine to run off, mebbe."</p>
<p>"Like to see him try that," said Legree, with a savage grin, "wouldn't we, Sambo?"</p>
<p>"Guess we would! Haw! haw! ho!" said the sooty gnome, laughing obsequiously. "Lord, de fun! To see him stickin' in de mud,&#8212;chasin' and tarin' through de bushes, dogs a holdin' on to him! Lord, I laughed fit to split, dat ar time we cotched Molly. I thought they'd a had her all stripped up afore I could get 'em off. She car's de marks o' dat ar spree yet."</p>
<p>"I reckon she will, to her grave," said Legree. "But now, Sambo, you look sharp. If the nigger's got anything of this sort going, trip him up."</p>
<p>"Mas'r, let me lone for dat," said Sambo, "I'll tree de coon. Ho, ho, ho!"</p>
<p>This was spoken as Legree was getting on his horse, to go to the neighboring town. That night, as he was returning, he thought he would turn his horse and ride round the quarters, and see if all was safe.</p>
<p>It was a superb moonlight night, and the shadows of the graceful China trees lay minutely pencilled on the turf below, and there was that transparent stillness in the air which it seems almost unholy to disturb. Legree was a little distance from the quarters, when he heard the voice of some one singing. It was not a usual sound there, and he paused to listen. A musical tenor voice sang,</p>
