<h6 id="dlepubid00013">Discovery</h6>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Shelby, after their protracted discussion of the night before, did not readily sink to repose, and, in consequence, slept somewhat later than usual, the ensuing morning.</p>
<p>"I wonder what keeps Eliza," said Mrs. Shelby, after giving her bell repeated pulls, to no purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. Shelby was standing before his dressing-glass, sharpening his razor; and just then the door opened, and a colored boy entered, with his shaving-water.</p>
<p>"Andy," said his mistress, "step to Eliza's door, and tell her I have rung for her three times. Poor thing!" she added, to herself, with a sigh.</p>
<p>Andy soon returned, with eyes very wide in astonishment.</p>
<p>"Lor, Missis! Lizy's drawers is all open, and her things all lying every which way; and I believe she's just done clared out!"</p>
<p>The truth flashed upon Mr. Shelby and his wife at the same moment. He exclaimed,</p>
<p>"Then she suspected it, and she's off!"</p>
<p>"The Lord be thanked!" said Mrs. Shelby. "I trust she is."</p>
<p>"Wife, you talk like a fool! Really, it will be something pretty awkward for me, if she is. Haley saw that I hesitated about selling this child, and he'll think I connived at it, to get him out of the way. It touches my honor!" And Mr. Shelby left the room hastily.</p>
<p>There was great running and ejaculating, and opening and shutting of doors, and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different places, for about a quarter of an hour. One person only, who might have shed some light on the matter, was entirely silent, and that was the head cook, Aunt Chloe. Silently, and with a heavy cloud settled down over her once joyous face, she proceeded making out her breakfast biscuits, as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her.</p>
<p>Very soon, about a dozen young imps were roosting, like so many crows, on the verandah railings, each one determined to be the first one to apprize the strange Mas'r of his ill luck.</p>
<p>"He'll be rael mad, I'll be bound," said Andy.</p>
<p>"<i>Won't</i> he swar!" said little black Jake.</p>
<p>"Yes, for he <i>does</i> swar," said woolly-headed Mandy. "I hearn him yesterday, at dinner. I hearn all about it then, 'cause I got into the closet where Missis keeps the great jugs, and I hearn every word." And Mandy, who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she had heard, more than a black cat, now took airs of superior wisdom, and strutted about, forgetting to state that, though actually coiled up among the jugs at the time specified, she had been fast asleep all the time.</p>
<p>When, at last, Haley appeared, booted and spurred, he was saluted with the bad tidings on every hand. The young imps on the verandah were not disappointed in their hope of hearing him "swar," which he did with a fluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly, as they ducked and dodged hither and thither, to be out of the reach of his riding-whip; and, all whooping off together, they tumbled, in a pile of immeasurable giggle, on the withered turf under the verandah, where they kicked up their heels and shouted to their full satisfaction.</p>
<p>"If I had the little devils!" muttered Haley, between his teeth.</p>
<p>"But you ha'nt got 'em, though!" said Andy, with a triumphant flourish, and making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate trader's back, when he was fairly beyond hearing.</p>
<p>"I say now, Shelby, this yer 's a most extro'rnary business!" said Haley, as he abruptly entered the parlor. "It seems that gal 's off, with her young un."</p>
<p>"Mr. Haley, Mrs. Shelby is present," said Mr. Shelby.</p>
<p>"I beg pardon, ma'am," said Haley, bowing slightly, with a still lowering brow; "but still I say, as I said before, this yer's a sing'lar report. Is it true, sir?"</p>
<p>"Sir," said Mr. Shelby, "if you wish to communicate with me, you must observe something of the decorum of a gentleman. Andy, take Mr. Haley's hat and riding-whip. Take a seat, sir. Yes, sir; I regret to say that the young woman, excited by overhearing, or having reported to her, something of this business, has taken her child in the night, and made off."</p>
<p>"I did expect fair dealing in this matter, I confess," said Haley.</p>
<p>"Well, sir," said Mr. Shelby, turning sharply round upon him, "what am I to understand by that remark? If any man calls my honor in question, I have but one answer for him."</p>
<p>The trader cowered at this, and in a somewhat lower tone said that "it was plaguy hard on a fellow, that had made a fair bargain, to be gulled that way."</p>
<p>"Mr. Haley," said Mr. Shelby, "if I did not think you had some cause for disappointment, I should not have borne from you the rude and unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning. I say thus much, however, since appearances call for it, that I shall allow of no insinuations cast upon me, as if I were at all partner to any unfairness in this matter. Moreover, I shall feel bound to give you every assistance, in the use of horses, servants, &amp;c., in the recovery of your property. So, in short, Haley," said he, suddenly dropping from the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness, "the best way for you is to keep good-natured and eat some breakfast, and we will then see what is to be done."</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelby now rose, and said her engagements would prevent her being at the breakfast-table that morning; and, deputing a very respectable mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemen's coffee at the side-board, she left the room.</p>
<p>"Old lady don't like your humble servant, over and above," said Haley, with an uneasy effort to be very familiar.</p>
<p>"I am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom," said Mr. Shelby, dryly.</p>
<p>"Beg pardon; of course, only a joke, you know," said Haley, forcing a laugh.</p>
<p>"Some jokes are less agreeable than others," rejoined Shelby.</p>
<p>"Devilish free, now I've signed those papers, cuss him!" muttered Haley to himself; "quite grand, since yesterday!"</p>
<p>Never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of sensation than the report of Tom's fate among his compeers on the place. It was the topic in every mouth, everywhere; and nothing was done in the house or in the field, but to discuss its probable results. Eliza's flight&#8212;an unprecedented event on the place&#8212;was also a great accessory in stimulating the general excitement.</p>
<p>Black Sam, as he was commonly called, from his being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place, was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings, with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal well-being, that would have done credit to any white patriot in Washington.</p>
<p>"It's an ill wind dat blow nowhar,&#8212;dat ar a fact," said Sam, sententiously, giving an additional hoist to his pantaloons, and adroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing suspender-button, with which effort of mechanical genius he seemed highly delighted.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's an ill wind blows nowhar," he repeated. "Now, dar, Tom's down&#8212;wal, course der's room for some nigger to be up&#8212;and why not dis nigger?&#8212;dat's de idee. Tom, a ridin' round de country&#8212;boots blacked&#8212;pass in his pocket&#8212;all grand as Cuffee&#8212;but who he? Now, why shouldn't Sam?&#8212;dat's what I want to know."</p>
<p>"Halloo, Sam&#8212;O Sam! Mas'r wants you to cotch Bill and Jerry," said Andy, cutting short Sam's soliloquy.</p>
<p>"High! what's afoot now, young un?"</p>
<p>"Why, you don't know, I s'pose, that Lizy's cut stick, and clared out, with her young un?"</p>
<p>"You teach your granny!" said Sam, with infinite contempt; "knowed it a heap sight sooner than you did; this nigger an't so green, now!"</p>
<p>"Well, anyhow, Mas'r wants Bill and Jerry geared right up; and you and I 's to go with Mas'r Haley, to look arter her."</p>
<p>"Good, now! dat's de time o' day!" said Sam. "It's Sam dat's called for in dese yer times. He's de nigger. See if I don't cotch her, now; Mas'r'll see what Sam can do!"</p>
<p>"Ah! but, Sam," said Andy, "you'd better think twice; for Missis don't want her cotched, and she'll be in yer wool."</p>
<p>"High!" said Sam, opening his eyes. "How you know dat?"</p>
<p>"Heard her say so, my own self, dis blessed mornin', when I bring in Mas'r's shaving-water. She sent me to see why Lizy didn't come to dress her; and when I telled her she was off, she jest ris up, and ses she, 'The Lord be praised;' and Mas'r, he seemed rael mad, and ses he, 'Wife, you talk like a fool.' But Lor! she'll bring him to! I knows well enough how that'll be,&#8212;it's allers best to stand Missis' side the fence, now I tell yer."</p>
<p>Black Sam, upon this, scratched his woolly pate, which, if it did not contain very profound wisdom, still contained a great deal of a particular species much in demand among politicians of all complexions and countries, and vulgarly denominated "knowing which side the bread is buttered;" so, stopping with grave consideration, he again gave a hitch to his pantaloons, which was his regularly organized method of assisting his mental perplexities.</p>
<p>"Der an't no saying'&#8212;never&#8212;'bout no kind o' thing in <i>dis</i> yer world," he said, at last. Sam spoke like a philosopher, emphasizing <i>this</i>&#8212;as if he had had a large experience in different sorts of worlds, and therefore had come to his conclusions advisedly.</p>
<p>"Now, sartin I'd a said that Missis would a scoured the varsal world after Lizy," added Sam, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"So she would," said Andy; "but can't ye see through a ladder, ye black nigger? Missis don't want dis yer Mas'r Haley to get Lizy's boy; dat's de go!"</p>
<p>"High!" said Sam, with an indescribable intonation, known only to those who have heard it among the negroes.</p>
<p>"And I'll tell yer more 'n all," said Andy; "I specs you'd better be making tracks for dem hosses,&#8212;mighty sudden, too,&#8212;-for I hearn Missis 'quirin' arter yer,&#8212;so you've stood foolin' long enough."</p>
<p>Sam, upon this, began to bestir himself in real earnest, and after a while appeared, bearing down gloriously towards the house, with Bill and Jerry in a full canter, and adroitly throwing himself off before they had any idea of stopping, he brought them up alongside of the horse-post like a tornado. Haley's horse, which was a skittish young colt, winced, and bounced, and pulled hard at his halter.</p>
<p>"Ho, ho!" said Sam, "skeery, ar ye?" and his black visage lighted up with a curious, mischievous gleam. "I'll fix ye now!" said he.</p>
<p>There was a large beech-tree overshadowing the place, and the small, sharp, triangular beech-nuts lay scattered thickly on the ground. With one of these in his fingers, Sam approached the colt, stroked and patted, and seemed apparently busy in soothing his agitation. On pretence of adjusting the saddle, he adroitly slipped under it the sharp little nut, in such a manner that the least weight brought upon the saddle would annoy the nervous sensibilities of the animal, without leaving any perceptible graze or wound.</p>
<p>"Dar!" he said, rolling his eyes with an approving grin; "me fix 'em!"</p>
<p>At this moment Mrs. Shelby appeared on the balcony, beckoning to him. Sam approached with as good a determination to pay court as did ever suitor after a vacant place at St. James' or Washington.</p>
<p>"Why have you been loitering so, Sam? I sent Andy to tell you to hurry."</p>
<p>"Lord bless you, Missis!" said Sam, "horses won't be cotched all in a minit; they'd done clared out way down to the south pasture, and the Lord knows whar!"</p>
<p>"Sam, how often must I tell you not to say 'Lord bless you, and the Lord knows,' and such things? It's wicked."</p>
<p>"O, Lord bless my soul! I done forgot, Missis! I won't say nothing of de sort no more."</p>
<p>"Why, Sam, you just <i>have</i> said it again."</p>
<p>"Did I? O, Lord! I mean&#8212;I didn't go fur to say it."</p>
<p>"You must be <i>careful</i>, Sam."</p>
<p>"Just let me get my breath, Missis, and I'll start fair. I'll be bery careful."</p>
<p>"Well, Sam, you are to go with Mr. Haley, to show him the road, and help him. Be careful of the horses, Sam; you know Jerry was a little lame last week; <i>don't ride them too fast</i>."</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelby spoke the last words with a low voice, and strong emphasis.</p>
<p>"Let dis child alone for dat!" said Sam, rolling up his eyes with a volume of meaning. "Lord knows! High! Didn't say dat!" said he, suddenly catching his breath, with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension, which made his mistress laugh, spite of herself. "Yes, Missis, I'll look out for de hosses!"</p>
<p>"Now, Andy," said Sam, returning to his stand under the beech-trees, "you see I wouldn't be 't all surprised if dat ar gen'lman's crittur should gib a fling, by and by, when he comes to be a gettin' up. You know, Andy, critturs <i>will</i> do such things;" and therewith Sam poked Andy in the side, in a highly suggestive manner.</p>
<p>"High!" said Andy, with an air of instant appreciation.</p>
<p>"Yes, you see, Andy, Missis wants to make time,&#8212;dat ar's clar to der most or'nary 'bserver. I jis make a little for her. Now, you see, get all dese yer hosses loose, caperin' permiscus round dis yer lot and down to de wood dar, and I spec Mas'r won't be off in a hurry."</p>
<p>Andy grinned.</p>
<p>"Yer see," said Sam, "yer see, Andy, if any such thing should happen as that Mas'r Haley's horse <i>should</i> begin to act contrary, and cut up, you and I jist lets go of our'n to help him, and <i>we'll help him</i>&#8212;oh yes!" And Sam and Andy laid their heads back on their shoulders, and broke into a low, immoderate laugh, snapping their fingers and flourishing their heels with exquisite delight.</p>
<p>At this instant, Haley appeared on the verandah. Somewhat mollified by certain cups of very good coffee, he came out smiling and talking, in tolerably restored humor. Sam and Andy, clawing for certain fragmentary palm-leaves, which they were in the habit of considering as hats, flew to the horseposts, to be ready to "help Mas'r."</p>
<p>Sam's palm-leaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions to braid, as respects its brim; and the slivers starting apart, and standing upright, gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance, quite equal to that of any Fejee chief; while the whole brim of Andy's being departed bodily, he rapped the crown on his head with a dexterous thump, and looked about well pleased, as if to say, "Who says I haven't got a hat?"</p>
<p>"Well, boys," said Haley, "look alive now; we must lose no time."</p>
<p>"Not a bit of him, Mas'r!" said Sam, putting Haley's rein in his hand, and holding his stirrup, while Andy was untying the other two horses.</p>
<p>The instant Haley touched the saddle, the mettlesome creature bounded from the earth with a sudden spring, that threw his master sprawling, some feet off, on the soft, dry turf. Sam, with frantic ejaculations, made a dive at the reins, but only succeeded in brushing the blazing palm-leaf afore-named into the horse's eyes, which by no means tended to allay the confusion of his nerves. So, with great vehemence, he overturned Sam, and, giving two or three contemptuous snorts, flourished his heels vigorously in the air, and was soon prancing away towards the lower end of the lawn, followed by Bill and Jerry, whom Andy had not failed to let loose, according to contract, speeding them off with various direful ejaculations. And now ensued a miscellaneous scene of confusion. Sam and Andy ran and shouted,&#8212;dogs barked here and there,&#8212;and Mike, Mose, Mandy, Fanny, and all the smaller specimens on the place, both male and female, raced, clapped hands, whooped, and shouted, with outrageous officiousness and untiring zeal.</p>
<p>Haley's horse, which was a white one, and very fleet and spirited, appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto; and having for his coursing ground a lawn of nearly half a mile in extent, gently sloping down on every side into indefinite woodland, he appeared to take infinite delight in seeing how near he could allow his pursuers to approach him, and then, when within a hand's breadth, whisk off with a start and a snort, like a mischievous beast as he was and career far down into some alley of the wood-lot. Nothing was further from Sam's mind than to have any one of the troop taken until such season as should seem to him most befitting,&#8212;and the exertions that he made were certainly most heroic. Like the sword of Coeur De Lion, which always blazed in the front and thickest of the battle, Sam's palm-leaf was to be seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could be caught; there he would bear down full tilt, shouting, "Now for it! cotch him! cotch him!" in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate rout in a moment.</p>
<p>Haley ran up and down, and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously. Mr. Shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony, and Mrs. Shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed and wondered,&#8212;not without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion.</p>
<p>At last, about twelve o'clock, Sam appeared triumphant, mounted on Jerry, with Haley's horse by his side, reeking with sweat, but with flashing eyes and dilated nostrils, showing that the spirit of freedom had not yet entirely subsided.</p>
<p>"He's cotched!" he exclaimed, triumphantly. "If 't hadn't been for me, they might a bust themselves, all on 'em; but I cotched him!"</p>
<p>"You!" growled Haley, in no amiable mood. "If it hadn't been for you, this never would have happened."</p>
<p>"Lord bless us, Mas'r," said Sam, in a tone of the deepest concern, "and me that has been racin' and chasin' till the sweat jest pours off me!"</p>
<p>"Well, well!" said Haley, "you've lost me near three hours, with your cursed nonsense. Now let's be off, and have no more fooling."</p>
<p>"Why, Mas'r," said Sam, in a deprecating tone, "I believe you mean to kill us all clar, horses and all. Here we are all just ready to drop down, and the critters all in a reek of sweat. Why, Mas'r won't think of startin' on now till arter dinner. Mas'r's hoss wants rubben down; see how he splashed hisself; and Jerry limps too; don't think Missis would be willin' to have us start dis yer way, no how. Lord bless you, Mas'r, we can ketch up, if we do stop. Lizy never was no great of a walker."</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelby, who, greatly to her amusement, had overheard this conversation from the verandah, now resolved to do her part. She came forward, and, courteously expressing her concern for Haley's accident, pressed him to stay to dinner, saying that the cook should bring it on the table immediately.</p>
<p>Thus, all things considered, Haley, with rather an equivocal grace, proceeded to the parlor, while Sam, rolling his eyes after him with unutterable meaning, proceeded gravely with the horses to the stable-yard.</p>
<p>"Did yer see him, Andy? <i>did</i> yer see him?" said Sam, when he had got fairly beyond the shelter of the barn, and fastened the horse to a post. "O, Lor, if it warn't as good as a meetin', now, to see him a dancin' and kickin' and swarin' at us. Didn't I hear him? Swar away, ole fellow (says I to myself ); will yer have yer hoss now, or wait till you cotch him? (says I). Lor, Andy, I think I can see him now." And Sam and Andy leaned up against the barn and laughed to their hearts' content.</p>
<p>"Yer oughter seen how mad he looked, when I brought the hoss up. Lord, he'd a killed me, if he durs' to; and there I was a standin' as innercent and as humble."</p>
<p>"Lor, I seed you," said Andy; "an't you an old hoss, Sam?"</p>
<p>"Rather specks I am," said Sam; "did yer see Missis up stars at the winder? I seed her laughin'."</p>
<p>"I'm sure, I was racin' so, I didn't see nothing," said Andy.</p>
<p>"Well, yer see," said Sam, proceeding gravely to wash down Haley's pony, "I 'se 'quired what yer may call a habit <i>o' bobservation</i>, Andy. It's a very 'portant habit, Andy; and I 'commend yer to be cultivatin' it, now yer young. Hist up that hind foot, Andy. Yer see, Andy, it's <i>bobservation</i> makes all de difference in niggers. Didn't I see which way the wind blew dis yer mornin'? Didn't I see what Missis wanted, though she never let on? Dat ar's bobservation, Andy. I 'spects it's what you may call a faculty. Faculties is different in different peoples, but cultivation of 'em goes a great way."</p>
<p>"I guess if I hadn't helped your bobservation dis mornin', yer wouldn't have seen your way so smart," said Andy.</p>
<p>"Andy," said Sam, "you's a promisin' child, der an't no manner o' doubt. I thinks lots of yer, Andy; and I don't feel no ways ashamed to take idees from you. We oughtenter overlook nobody, Andy, cause the smartest on us gets tripped up sometimes. And so, Andy, let's go up to the house now. I'll be boun' Missis'll give us an uncommon good bite, dis yer time."</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00014">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00015">The Mother's Struggle</h6>
<p>It is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate and forlorn than Eliza, when she turned her footsteps from Uncle Tom's cabin.</p>
<p>Her husband's suffering and dangers, and the danger of her child, all blended in her mind, with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she was running, in leaving the only home she had ever known, and cutting loose from the protection of a friend whom she loved and revered. Then there was the parting from every familiar object,&#8212;the place where she had grown up, the trees under which she had played, the groves where she had walked many an evening in happier days, by the side of her young husband,&#8212;everything, as it lay in the clear, frosty starlight, seemed to speak reproachfully to her, and ask her whither could she go from a home like that?</p>
<p>But stronger than all was maternal love, wrought into a paroxysm of frenzy by the near approach of a fearful danger. Her boy was old enough to have walked by her side, and, in an indifferent case, she would only have led him by the hand; but now the bare thought of putting him out of her arms made her shudder, and she strained him to her bosom with a convulsive grasp, as she went rapidly forward.</p>
<p>The frosty ground creaked beneath her feet, and she trembled at the sound; every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood backward to her heart, and quickened her footsteps. She wondered within herself at the strength that seemed to be come upon her; for she felt the weight of her boy as if it had been a feather, and every flutter of fear seemed to increase the supernatural power that bore her on, while from her pale lips burst forth, in frequent ejaculations, the prayer to a Friend above&#8212;"Lord, help! Lord, save me!"</p>
<p>If it were <i>your</i> Harry, mother, or your Willie, that were going to be torn from you by a brutal trader, tomorrow morning,&#8212;if you had seen the man, and heard that the papers were signed and delivered, and you had only from twelve o'clock till morning to make good your escape,&#8212;how fast could <i>you</i> walk? How many miles could you make in those few brief hours, with the darling at your bosom,&#8212;the little sleepy head on your shoulder,&#8212;the small, soft arms trustingly holding on to your neck?</p>
<p>For the child slept. At first, the novelty and alarm kept him waking; but his mother so hurriedly repressed every breath or sound, and so assured him that if he were only still she would certainly save him, that he clung quietly round her neck, only asking, as he found himself sinking to sleep,</p>
<p>"Mother, I don't need to keep awake, do I?"</p>
<p>"No, my darling; sleep, if you want to."</p>
<p>"But, mother, if I do get asleep, you won't let him get me?"</p>
<p>"No! so may God help me!" said his mother, with a paler cheek, and a brighter light in her large dark eyes.</p>
<p>"You're <i>sure</i>, an't you, mother?"</p>
<p>"Yes, <i>sure</i>!" said the mother, in a voice that startled herself; for it seemed to her to come from a spirit within, that was no part of her; and the boy dropped his little weary head on her shoulder, and was soon asleep. How the touch of those warm arms, the gentle breathings that came in her neck, seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements! It seemed to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams, from every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping, confiding child. Sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body, that, for a time, can make flesh and nerve impregnable, and string the sinews like steel, so that the weak become so mighty.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the farm, the grove, the wood-lot, passed by her dizzily, as she walked on; and still she went, leaving one familiar object after another, slacking not, pausing not, till reddening daylight found her many a long mile from all traces of any familiar objects upon the open highway.</p>
<p>She had often been, with her mistress, to visit some connections, in the little village of T&#8212;&#8212;, not far from the Ohio river, and knew the road well. To go thither, to escape across the Ohio river, were the first hurried outlines of her plan of escape; beyond that, she could only hope in God.</p>
<p>When horses and vehicles began to move along the highway, with that alert perception peculiar to a state of excitement, and which seems to be a sort of inspiration, she became aware that her headlong pace and distracted air might bring on her remark and suspicion. She therefore put the boy on the ground, and, adjusting her dress and bonnet, she walked on at as rapid a pace as she thought consistent with the preservation of appearances. In her little bundle she had provided a store of cakes and apples, which she used as expedients for quickening the speed of the child, rolling the apple some yards before them, when the boy would run with all his might after it; and this ruse, often repeated, carried them over many a half-mile.</p>
<p>After a while, they came to a thick patch of woodland, through which murmured a clear brook. As the child complained of hunger and thirst, she climbed over the fence with him; and, sitting down behind a large rock which concealed them from the road, she gave him a breakfast out of her little package. The boy wondered and grieved that she could not eat; and when, putting his arms round her neck, he tried to wedge some of his cake into her mouth, it seemed to her that the rising in her throat would choke her.</p>
<p>"No, no, Harry darling! mother can't eat till you are safe! We must go on&#8212;on&#8212;till we come to the river!" And she hurried again into the road, and again constrained herself to walk regularly and composedly forward.</p>
<p>She was many miles past any neighborhood where she was personally known. If she should chance to meet any who knew her, she reflected that the well-known kindness of the family would be of itself a blind to suspicion, as making it an unlikely supposition that she could be a fugitive. As she was also so white as not to be known as of colored lineage, without a critical survey, and her child was white also, it was much easier for her to pass on unsuspected.</p>
<p>On this presumption, she stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse, to rest herself, and buy some dinner for her child and self; for, as the danger decreased with the distance, the supernatural tension of the nervous system lessened, and she found herself both weary and hungry.</p>
<p>The good woman, kindly and gossipping, seemed rather pleased than otherwise with having somebody come in to talk with; and accepted, without examination, Eliza's statement, that she "was going on a little piece, to spend a week with her friends,"&#8212;all which she hoped in her heart might prove strictly true.</p>
<p>An hour before sunset, she entered the village of T&#8212;&#8212;, by the Ohio river, weary and foot-sore, but still strong in heart. Her first glance was at the river, which lay, like Jordan, between her and the Canaan of liberty on the other side.</p>
<p>It was now early spring, and the river was swollen and turbulent; great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid waters. Owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the Kentucky side, the land bending far out into the water, the ice had been lodged and detained in great quantities, and the narrow channel which swept round the bend was full of ice, piled one cake over another, thus forming a temporary barrier to the descending ice, which lodged, and formed a great, undulating raft, filling up the whole river, and extending almost to the Kentucky shore.</p>
<p>Eliza stood, for a moment, contemplating this unfavorable aspect of things, which she saw at once must prevent the usual ferry-boat from running, and then turned into a small public house on the bank, to make a few inquiries.</p>
<p>The hostess, who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over the fire, preparatory to the evening meal, stopped, with a fork in her hand, as Eliza's sweet and plaintive voice arrested her.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she said.</p>
<p>"Isn't there any ferry or boat, that takes people over to B&#8212;&#8212;, now?" she said.</p>
<p>"No, indeed!" said the woman; "the boats has stopped running."</p>
<p>Eliza's look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman, and she said, inquiringly,</p>
<p>"May be you're wanting to get over?&#8212;anybody sick? Ye seem mighty anxious?"</p>
<p>"I've got a child that's very dangerous," said Eliza. "I never heard of it till last night, and I've walked quite a piece today, in hopes to get to the ferry."</p>
<p>"Well, now, that's onlucky," said the woman, whose motherly sympathies were much aroused; "I'm re'lly consarned for ye. Solomon!" she called, from the window, towards a small back building. A man, in leather apron and very dirty hands, appeared at the door.</p>
<p>"I say, Sol," said the woman, "is that ar man going to tote them bar'ls over tonight?"</p>
<p>"He said he should try, if 't was any way prudent," said the man.</p>
<p>"There's a man a piece down here, that's going over with some truck this evening, if he durs' to; he'll be in here to supper tonight, so you'd better set down and wait. That's a sweet little fellow," added the woman, offering him a cake.</p>
<p>But the child, wholly exhausted, cried with weariness.</p>
<p>"Poor fellow! he isn't used to walking, and I've hurried him on so," said Eliza.</p>
<p>"Well, take him into this room," said the woman, opening into a small bed-room, where stood a comfortable bed. Eliza laid the weary boy upon it, and held his hands in hers till he was fast asleep. For her there was no rest. As a fire in her bones, the thought of the pursuer urged her on; and she gazed with longing eyes on the sullen, surging waters that lay between her and liberty.</p>
<p>Here we must take our leave of her for the present, to follow the course of her pursuers.</p>
<p>Though Mrs. Shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on table, yet it was soon seen, as the thing has often been seen before, that it required more than one to make a bargain. So, although the order was fairly given out in Haley's hearing, and carried to Aunt Chloe by at least half a dozen juvenile messengers, that dignitary only gave certain very gruff snorts, and tosses of her head, and went on with every operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner.</p>
<p>For some singular reason, an impression seemed to reign among the servants generally that Missis would not be particularly disobliged by delay; and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred constantly, to retard the course of things. One luckless wight contrived to upset the gravy; and then gravy had to be got up <i>de novo</i>, with due care and formality, Aunt Chloe watching and stirring with dogged precision, answering shortly, to all suggestions of haste, that she "warn't a going to have raw gravy on the table, to help nobody's catchings." One tumbled down with the water, and had to go to the spring for more; and another precipitated the butter into the path of events; and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen that "Mas'r Haley was mighty oneasy, and that he couldn't sit in his cheer no ways, but was a walkin' and stalkin' to the winders and through the porch."</p>
<p>"Sarves him right!" said Aunt Chloe, indignantly. "He'll get wus nor oneasy, one of these days, if he don't mend his ways. <i>His</i> master'll be sending for him, and then see how he'll look!"</p>
<p>"He'll go to torment, and no mistake," said little Jake.</p>
<p>"He desarves it!" said Aunt Chloe, grimly; "he's broke a many, many, many hearts,&#8212;I tell ye all!" she said, stopping, with a fork uplifted in her hands; "it's like what Mas'r George reads in Ravelations,&#8212;souls a callin' under the altar! and a callin' on the Lord for vengeance on sich!&#8212;and by and by the Lord he'll hear 'em&#8212;so he will!"</p>
<p>Aunt Chloe, who was much revered in the kitchen, was listened to with open mouth; and, the dinner being now fairly sent in, the whole kitchen was at leisure to gossip with her, and to listen to her remarks.</p>
<p>"Sich'll be burnt up forever, and no mistake; won't ther?" said Andy.</p>
<p>"I'd be glad to see it, I'll be boun'," said little Jake.</p>
<p>"Chil'en!" said a voice, that made them all start. It was Uncle Tom, who had come in, and stood listening to the conversation at the door.</p>
<p>"Chil'en!" he said, "I'm afeard you don't know what ye're sayin'. Forever is a <i>dre'ful</i> word, chil'en; it's awful to think on 't. You oughtenter wish that ar to any human crittur."</p>
<p>"We wouldn't to anybody but the soul-drivers," said Andy; "nobody can help wishing it to them, they 's so awful wicked."</p>
<p>"Don't natur herself kinder cry out on 'em?" said Aunt Chloe. "Don't dey tear der suckin' baby right off his mother's breast, and sell him, and der little children as is crying and holding on by her clothes,&#8212;don't dey pull 'em off and sells 'em? Don't dey tear wife and husband apart?" said Aunt Chloe, beginning to cry, "when it's jest takin' the very life on 'em?&#8212;and all the while does they feel one bit, don't dey drink and smoke, and take it oncommon easy? Lor, if the devil don't get them, what's he good for?" And Aunt Chloe covered her face with her checked apron, and began to sob in good earnest.</p>
<p>"Pray for them that 'spitefully use you, the good book says," says Tom.</p>
<p>"Pray for 'em!" said Aunt Chloe; "Lor, it's too tough! I can't pray for 'em."</p>
<p>"It's natur, Chloe, and natur 's strong," said Tom, "but the Lord's grace is stronger; besides, you oughter think what an awful state a poor crittur's soul 's in that'll do them ar things,&#8212;you oughter thank God that you an't <i>like</i> him, Chloe. I'm sure I'd rather be sold, ten thousand times over, than to have all that ar poor crittur's got to answer for."</p>
<p>"So 'd I, a heap," said Jake. "Lor, <i>shouldn't</i> we cotch it, Andy?"</p>
<p>Andy shrugged his shoulders, and gave an acquiescent whistle.</p>
<p>"I'm glad Mas'r didn't go off this morning, as he looked to," said Tom; "that ar hurt me more than sellin', it did. Mebbe it might have been natural for him, but 't would have come desp't hard on me, as has known him from a baby; but I've seen Mas'r, and I begin ter feel sort o' reconciled to the Lord's will now. Mas'r couldn't help hisself; he did right, but I'm feared things will be kinder goin' to rack, when I'm gone Mas'r can't be spected to be a pryin' round everywhar, as I've done, a keepin' up all the ends. The boys all means well, but they 's powerful car'less. That ar troubles me."</p>
<p>The bell here rang, and Tom was summoned to the parlor.</p>
<p>"Tom," said his master, kindly, "I want you to notice that I give this gentleman bonds to forfeit a thousand dollars if you are not on the spot when he wants you; he's going today to look after his other business, and you can have the day to yourself. Go anywhere you like, boy."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mas'r," said Tom.</p>
<p>"And mind yourself," said the trader, "and don't come it over your master with any o' yer nigger tricks; for I'll take every cent out of him, if you an't thar. If he'd hear to me, he wouldn't trust any on ye&#8212;slippery as eels!"</p>
<p>"Mas'r," said Tom,&#8212;and he stood very straight,&#8212;"I was jist eight years old when ole Missis put you into my arms, and you wasn't a year old. 'Thar,' says she, 'Tom, that's to be <i>your</i> young Mas'r; take good care on him,' says she. And now I jist ask you, Mas'r, have I ever broke word to you, or gone contrary to you, 'specially since I was a Christian?"</p>
<p>Mr. Shelby was fairly overcome, and the tears rose to his eyes.</p>
<p>"My good boy," said he, "the Lord knows you say but the truth; and if I was able to help it, all the world shouldn't buy you."</p>
<p>"And sure as I am a Christian woman," said Mrs. Shelby, "you shall be redeemed as soon as I can any way bring together means. Sir," she said to Haley, "take good account of who you sell him to, and let me know."</p>
<p>"Lor, yes, for that matter," said the trader, "I may bring him up in a year, not much the wuss for wear, and trade him back."</p>
<p>"I'll trade with you then, and make it for your advantage," said Mrs. Shelby.</p>
<p>"Of course," said the trader, "all 's equal with me; li'ves trade 'em up as down, so I does a good business. All I want is a livin', you know, ma'am; that's all any on us wants, I, s'pose."</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Shelby both felt annoyed and degraded by the familiar impudence of the trader, and yet both saw the absolute necessity of putting a constraint on their feelings. The more hopelessly sordid and insensible he appeared, the greater became Mrs. Shelby's dread of his succeeding in recapturing Eliza and her child, and of course the greater her motive for detaining him by every female artifice. She therefore graciously smiled, assented, chatted familiarly, and did all she could to make time pass imperceptibly.</p>
<p>At two o'clock Sam and Andy brought the horses up to the posts, apparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the morning.</p>
<p>Sam was there new oiled from dinner, with an abundance of zealous and ready officiousness. As Haley approached, he was boasting, in flourishing style, to Andy, of the evident and eminent success of the operation, now that he had "farly come to it."</p>
<p>"Your master, I s'pose, don't keep no dogs," said Haley, thoughtfully, as he prepared to mount.</p>
<p>"Heaps on 'em," said Sam, triumphantly; "thar's Bruno&#8212;he's a roarer! and, besides that, 'bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur or uther."</p>
<p>"Poh!" said Haley,&#8212;and he said something else, too, with regard to the said dogs, at which Sam muttered,</p>
<p>"I don't see no use cussin' on 'em, no way."</p>
<p>"But your master don't keep no dogs (I pretty much know he don't) for trackin' out niggers."</p>
<p>Sam knew exactly what he meant, but he kept on a look of earnest and desperate simplicity.</p>
<p>"Our dogs all smells round considable sharp. I spect they's the kind, though they han't never had no practice. They 's <i>far</i> dogs, though, at most anything, if you'd get 'em started. Here, Bruno," he called, whistling to the lumbering Newfoundland, who came pitching tumultuously toward them.</p>
<p>"You go hang!" said Haley, getting up. "Come, tumble up now."</p>
<p>Sam tumbled up accordingly, dexterously contriving to tickle Andy as he did so, which occasioned Andy to split out into a laugh, greatly to Haley's indignation, who made a cut at him with his riding-whip.</p>
<p>"I 's 'stonished at yer, Andy," said Sam, with awful gravity. "This yer's a seris bisness, Andy. Yer mustn't be a makin' game. This yer an't no way to help Mas'r."</p>
<p>"I shall take the straight road to the river," said Haley, decidedly, after they had come to the boundaries of the estate. "I know the way of all of 'em,&#8212;they makes tracks for the underground."</p>
<p>"Sartin," said Sam, "dat's de idee. Mas'r Haley hits de thing right in de middle. Now, der's two roads to de river,&#8212;de dirt road and der pike,&#8212;which Mas'r mean to take?"</p>
<p>Andy looked up innocently at Sam, surprised at hearing this new geographical fact, but instantly confirmed what he said, by a vehement reiteration.</p>
<p>"Cause," said Sam, "I'd rather be 'clined to 'magine that Lizy 'd take de dirt road, bein' it's the least travelled."</p>
<p>Haley, notwithstanding that he was a very old bird, and naturally inclined to be suspicious of chaff, was rather brought up by this view of the case.</p>
<p>"If yer warn't both on yer such cussed liars, now!" he said, contemplatively as he pondered a moment.</p>
<p>The pensive, reflective tone in which this was spoken appeared to amuse Andy prodigiously, and he drew a little behind, and shook so as apparently to run a great risk of failing off his horse, while Sam's face was immovably composed into the most doleful gravity.</p>
<p>"Course," said Sam, "Mas'r can do as he'd ruther, go de straight road, if Mas'r thinks best,&#8212;it's all one to us. Now, when I study 'pon it, I think de straight road de best, <i>deridedly</i>."</p>
<p>"She would naturally go a lonesome way," said Haley, thinking aloud, and not minding Sam's remark.</p>
<p>"Dar an't no sayin'," said Sam; "gals is pecular; they never does nothin' ye thinks they will; mose gen'lly the contrary. Gals is nat'lly made contrary; and so, if you thinks they've gone one road, it is sartin you'd better go t' other, and then you'll be sure to find 'em. Now, my private 'pinion is, Lizy took der road; so I think we'd better take de straight one."</p>
<p>This profound generic view of the female sex did not seem to dispose Haley particularly to the straight road, and he announced decidedly that he should go the other, and asked Sam when they should come to it.</p>
<p>"A little piece ahead," said Sam, giving a wink to Andy with the eye which was on Andy's side of the head; and he added, gravely, "but I've studded on de matter, and I'm quite clar we ought not to go dat ar way. I nebber been over it no way. It's despit lonesome, and we might lose our way,&#8212;whar we'd come to, de Lord only knows."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless," said Haley, "I shall go that way."</p>
<p>"Now I think on 't, I think I hearn 'em tell that dat ar road was all fenced up and down by der creek, and thar, an't it, Andy?"</p>
<p>Andy wasn't certain; he'd only "hearn tell" about that road, but never been over it. In short, he was strictly noncommittal.</p>
<p>Haley, accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies of greater or lesser magnitude, thought that it lay in favor of the dirt road aforesaid. The mention of the thing he thought he perceived was involuntary on Sam's part at first, and his confused attempts to dissuade him he set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts, as being unwilling to implicate Liza.</p>
<p>When, therefore, Sam indicated the road, Haley plunged briskly into it, followed by Sam and Andy.</p>
<p>Now, the road, in fact, was an old one, that had formerly been a thoroughfare to the river, but abandoned for many years after the laying of the new pike. It was open for about an hour's ride, and after that it was cut across by various farms and fences. Sam knew this fact perfectly well,&#8212;indeed, the road had been so long closed up, that Andy had never heard of it. He therefore rode along with an air of dutiful submission, only groaning and vociferating occasionally that 't was "desp't rough, and bad for Jerry's foot."</p>
<p>"Now, I jest give yer warning," said Haley, "I know yer; yer won't get me to turn off this road, with all yer fussin'&#8212;so you shet up!"</p>
<p>"Mas'r will go his own way!" said Sam, with rueful submission, at the same time winking most portentously to Andy, whose delight was now very near the explosive point.</p>
<p>Sam was in wonderful spirits,&#8212;professed to keep a very brisk lookout,&#8212;at one time exclaiming that he saw "a gal's bonnet" on the top of some distant eminence, or calling to Andy "if that thar wasn't 'Lizy' down in the hollow;" always making these exclamations in some rough or craggy part of the road, where the sudden quickening of speed was a special inconvenience to all parties concerned, and thus keeping Haley in a state of constant commotion.</p>
<p>After riding about an hour in this way, the whole party made a precipitate and tumultuous descent into a barn-yard belonging to a large farming establishment. Not a soul was in sight, all the hands being employed in the fields; but, as the barn stood conspicuously and plainly square across the road, it was evident that their journey in that direction had reached a decided finale.</p>
<p>"Wan't dat ar what I telled Mas'r?" said Sam, with an air of injured innocence. "How does strange gentleman spect to know more about a country dan de natives born and raised?"</p>
<p>"You rascal!" said Haley, "you knew all about this."</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell yer I <i>knowd</i>, and yer wouldn't believe me? I telled Mas'r 't was all shet up, and fenced up, and I didn't spect we could get through,&#8212;Andy heard me."</p>
<p>It was all too true to be disputed, and the unlucky man had to pocket his wrath with the best grace he was able, and all three faced to the right about, and took up their line of march for the highway.</p>
<p>In consequence of all the various delays, it was about three-quarters of an hour after Eliza had laid her child to sleep in the village tavern that the party came riding into the same place. Eliza was standing by the window, looking out in another direction, when Sam's quick eye caught a glimpse of her. Haley and Andy were two yards behind. At this crisis, Sam contrived to have his hat blown off, and uttered a loud and characteristic ejaculation, which startled her at once; she drew suddenly back; the whole train swept by the window, round to the front door.</p>
<p>A thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to Eliza. Her room opened by a side door to the river. She caught her child, and sprang down the steps towards it. The trader caught a full glimpse of her just as she was disappearing down the bank; and throwing himself from his horse, and calling loudly on Sam and Andy, he was after her like a hound after a deer. In that dizzy moment her feet to her scarce seemed to touch the ground, and a moment brought her to the water's edge. Right on behind they came; and, nerved with strength such as God gives only to the desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of ice beyond. It was a desperate leap&#8212;impossible to anything but madness and despair; and Haley, Sam, and Andy, instinctively cried out, and lifted up their hands, as she did it.</p>
<p>The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked as her weight came on it, but she staid there not a moment. With wild cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still another cake; stumbling&#8212;leaping&#8212;slipping&#8212;springing upwards again! Her shoes are gone&#8212;her stockings cut from her feet&#8212;while blood marked every step; but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream, she saw the Ohio side, and a man helping her up the bank.</p>
<p>"Yer a brave gal, now, whoever ye ar!" said the man, with an oath.</p>
<p>Eliza recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far from her old home.</p>
<p>"O, Mr. Symmes!&#8212;save me&#8212;do save me&#8212;do hide me!" said Elia.</p>
<p>"Why, what's this?" said the man. "Why, if 'tan't Shelby's gal!"</p>
<p>"My child!&#8212;this boy!&#8212;he'd sold him! There is his Mas'r," said she, pointing to the Kentucky shore. "O, Mr. Symmes, you've got a little boy!"</p>
<p>"So I have," said the man, as he roughly, but kindly, drew her up the steep bank. "Besides, you're a right brave gal. I like grit, wherever I see it."</p>
<p>When they had gained the top of the bank, the man paused.</p>
<p>"I'd be glad to do something for ye," said he; "but then there's nowhar I could take ye. The best I can do is to tell ye to go <i>thar</i>," said he, pointing to a large white house which stood by itself, off the main street of the village. "Go thar; they're kind folks. Thar's no kind o' danger but they'll help you,&#8212;they're up to all that sort o' thing."</p>
<p>"The Lord bless you!" said Eliza, earnestly.</p>
<p>"No 'casion, no 'casion in the world," said the man. "What I've done's of no 'count."</p>
<p>"And, oh, surely, sir, you won't tell any one!"</p>
<p>"Go to thunder, gal! What do you take a feller for? In course not," said the man. "Come, now, go along like a likely, sensible gal, as you are. You've arnt your liberty, and you shall have it, for all me."</p>
<p>The woman folded her child to her bosom, and walked firmly and swiftly away. The man stood and looked after her.</p>
<p>"Shelby, now, mebbe won't think this yer the most neighborly thing in the world; but what's a feller to do? If he catches one of my gals in the same fix, he's welcome to pay back. Somehow I never could see no kind o' critter a strivin' and pantin', and trying to clar theirselves, with the dogs arter 'em and go agin 'em. Besides, I don't see no kind of 'casion for me to be hunter and catcher for other folks, neither."</p>
<p>So spoke this poor, heathenish Kentuckian, who had not been instructed in his constitutional relations, and consequently was betrayed into acting in a sort of Christianized manner, which, if he had been better situated and more enlightened, he would not have been left to do.</p>
<p>Haley had stood a perfectly amazed spectator of the scene, till Eliza had disappeared up the bank, when he turned a blank, inquiring look on Sam and Andy.</p>
<p>"That ar was a tolable fair stroke of business," said Sam.</p>
<p>"The gal 's got seven devils in her, I believe!" said Haley. "How like a wildcat she jumped!"</p>
<p>"Wal, now," said Sam, scratching his head, "I hope Mas'r'll 'scuse us trying dat ar road. Don't think I feel spry enough for dat ar, no way!" and Sam gave a hoarse chuckle.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> laugh!" said the trader, with a growl.</p>
<p>"Lord bless you, Mas'r, I couldn't help it now," said Sam, giving way to the long pent-up delight of his soul. "She looked so curi's, a leapin' and springin'&#8212;ice a crackin'&#8212;and only to hear her,&#8212;plump! ker chunk! ker splash! Spring! Lord! how she goes it!" and Sam and Andy laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks.</p>
<p>"I'll make ye laugh t' other side yer mouths!" said the trader, laying about their heads with his riding-whip.</p>
<p>Both ducked, and ran shouting up the bank, and were on their horses before he was up.</p>
<p>"Good-evening, Mas'r!" said Sam, with much gravity. "I berry much spect Missis be anxious 'bout Jerry. Mas'r Haley won't want us no longer. Missis wouldn't hear of our ridin' the critters over Lizy's bridge tonight;" and, with a facetious poke into Andy's ribs, he started off, followed by the latter, at full speed,&#8212;their shouts of laughter coming faintly on the wind.</p>
