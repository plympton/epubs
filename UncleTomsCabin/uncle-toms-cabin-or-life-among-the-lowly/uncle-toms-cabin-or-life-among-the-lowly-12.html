<h2 id="dlepubid00051">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00052">The Little Evangelist</h6>
<p>It was Sunday afternoon. St. Clare was stretched on a bamboo lounge in the verandah, solacing himself with a cigar. Marie lay reclined on a sofa, opposite the window opening on the verandah, closely secluded, under an awning of transparent gauze, from the outrages of the mosquitos, and languidly holding in her hand an elegantly bound prayer-book. She was holding it because it was Sunday, and she imagined she had been reading it,&#8212;though, in fact, she had been only taking a succession of short naps, with it open in her hand.</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia, who, after some rummaging, had hunted up a small Methodist meeting within riding distance, had gone out, with Tom as driver, to attend it; and Eva had accompanied them.</p>
<p>"I say, Augustine," said Marie after dozing a while, "I must send to the city after my old Doctor Posey; I'm sure I've got the complaint of the heart."</p>
<p>"Well; why need you send for him? This doctor that attends Eva seems skilful."</p>
<p>"I would not trust him in a critical case," said Marie; "and I think I may say mine is becoming so! I've been thinking of it, these two or three nights past; I have such distressing pains, and such strange feelings."</p>
<p>"O, Marie, you are blue; I don't believe it's heart complaint."</p>
<p>"I dare say <i>you</i> don't," said Marie; "I was prepared to expect <i>that</i>. You can be alarmed enough, if Eva coughs, or has the least thing the matter with her; but you never think of me."</p>
<p>"If it's particularly agreeable to you to have heart disease, why, I'll try and maintain you have it," said St. Clare; "I didn't know it was."</p>
<p>"Well, I only hope you won't be sorry for this, when it's too late!" said Marie; "but, believe it or not, my distress about Eva, and the exertions I have made with that dear child, have developed what I have long suspected."</p>
<p>What the <i>exertions</i> were which Marie referred to, it would have been difficult to state. St. Clare quietly made this commentary to himself, and went on smoking, like a hard-hearted wretch of a man as he was, till a carriage drove up before the verandah, and Eva and Miss Ophelia alighted.</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia marched straight to her own chamber, to put away her bonnet and shawl, as was always her manner, before she spoke a word on any subject; while Eva came, at St. Clare's call, and was sitting on his knee, giving him an account of the services they had heard.</p>
<p>They soon heard loud exclamations from Miss Ophelia's room, which, like the one in which they were sitting, opened on to the verandah and violent reproof addressed to somebody.</p>
<p>"What new witchcraft has Tops been brewing?" asked St. Clare. "That commotion is of her raising, I'll be bound!"</p>
<p>And, in a moment after, Miss Ophelia, in high indignation, came dragging the culprit along.</p>
<p>"Come out here, now!" she said. "I <i>will</i> tell your master!"</p>
<p>"What's the case now?" asked Augustine.</p>
<p>"The case is, that I cannot be plagued with this child, any longer! It's past all bearing; flesh and blood cannot endure it! Here, I locked her up, and gave her a hymn to study; and what does she do, but spy out where I put my key, and has gone to my bureau, and got a bonnet-trimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dolls' jackets! I never saw anything like it, in my life!"</p>
<p>"I told you, Cousin," said Marie, "that you'd find out that these creatures can't be brought up without severity. If I had <i>my</i> way, now," she said, looking reproachfully at St. Clare, "I'd send that child out, and have her thoroughly whipped; I'd have her whipped till she couldn't stand!"</p>
<p>"I don't doubt it," said St. Clare. "Tell me of the lovely rule of woman! I never saw above a dozen women that wouldn't half kill a horse, or a servant, either, if they had their own way with them!&#8212;let alone a man."</p>
<p>"There is no use in this shilly-shally way of yours, St. Clare!" said Marie. "Cousin is a woman of sense, and she sees it now, as plain as I do."</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia had just the capability of indignation that belongs to the thorough-paced housekeeper, and this had been pretty actively roused by the artifice and wastefulness of the child; in fact, many of my lady readers must own that they should have felt just so in her circumstances; but Marie's words went beyond her, and she felt less heat.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have the child treated so, for the world," she said; "but, I am sure, Augustine, I don't know what to do. I've taught and taught; I've talked till I'm tired; I've whipped her; I've punished her in every way I can think of, and she's just what she was at first."</p>
<p>"Come here, Tops, you monkey!" said St. Clare, calling the child up to him.</p>
<p>Topsy came up; her round, hard eyes glittering and blinking with a mixture of apprehensiveness and their usual odd drollery.</p>
<p>"What makes you behave so?" said St. Clare, who could not help being amused with the child's expression.</p>
<p>"Spects it's my wicked heart," said Topsy, demurely; "Miss Feely says so."</p>
<p>"Don't you see how much Miss Ophelia has done for you? She says she has done everything she can think of."</p>
<p>"Lor, yes, Mas'r! old Missis used to say so, too. She whipped me a heap harder, and used to pull my har, and knock my head agin the door; but it didn't do me no good! I spects, if they 's to pull every spire o' har out o' my head, it wouldn't do no good, neither,&#8212;I 's so wicked! Laws! I 's nothin but a nigger, no ways!"</p>
<p>"Well, I shall have to give her up," said Miss Ophelia; "I can't have that trouble any longer."</p>
<p>"Well, I'd just like to ask one question," said St. Clare.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Why, if your Gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child, that you can have at home here, all to yourself, what's the use of sending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of just such? I suppose this child is about a fair sample of what thousands of your heathen are."</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia did not make an immediate answer; and Eva, who had stood a silent spectator of the scene thus far, made a silent sign to Topsy to follow her. There was a little glass-room at the corner of the verandah, which St. Clare used as a sort of reading-room; and Eva and Topsy disappeared into this place.</p>
<p>"What's Eva going about, now?" said St. Clare; "I mean to see."</p>
<p>And, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the glass-door, and looked in. In a moment, laying his finger on his lips, he made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look. There sat the two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them. Topsy, with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to her, Eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large eyes.</p>
<p>"What does make you so bad, Topsy? Why won't you try and be good? Don't you love <i>anybody</i>, Topsy?"</p>
<p>"Donno nothing 'bout love; I loves candy and sich, that's all," said Topsy.</p>
<p>"But you love your father and mother?"</p>
<p>"Never had none, ye know. I telled ye that, Miss Eva."</p>
<p>"O, I know," said Eva, sadly; "but hadn't you any brother, or sister, or aunt, or&#8212;"</p>
<p>"No, none on 'em,&#8212;never had nothing nor nobody."</p>
<p>"But, Topsy, if you'd only try to be good, you might&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Couldn't never be nothin' but a nigger, if I was ever so good," said Topsy. "If I could be skinned, and come white, I'd try then."</p>
<p>"But people can love you, if you are black, Topsy. Miss Ophelia would love you, if you were good."</p>
<p>Topsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing incredulity.</p>
<p>"Don't you think so?" said Eva.</p>
<p>"No; she can't bar me, 'cause I'm a nigger!&#8212;she'd 's soon have a toad touch her! There can't nobody love niggers, and niggers can't do nothin'! <i>I</i> don't care," said Topsy, beginning to whistle.</p>
<p>"O, Topsy, poor child, <i>I</i> love you!" said Eva, with a sudden burst of feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on Topsy's shoulder; "I love you, because you haven't had any father, or mother, or friends;&#8212;because you've been a poor, abused child! I love you, and I want you to be good. I am very unwell, Topsy, and I think I shan't live a great while; and it really grieves me, to have you be so naughty. I wish you would try to be good, for my sake;&#8212;it's only a little while I shall be with you."</p>
<p>The round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with tears;&#8212;large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on the little white hand. Yes, in that moment, a ray of real belief, a ray of heavenly love, had penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul! She laid her head down between her knees, and wept and sobbed,&#8212;while the beautiful child, bending over her, looked like the picture of some bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner.</p>
<p>"Poor Topsy!" said Eva, "don't you know that Jesus loves all alike? He is just as willing to love you, as me. He loves you just as I do,&#8212;only more, because he is better. He will help you to be good; and you can go to Heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you were white. Only think of it, Topsy!&#8212;<i>you</i> can be one of those spirits bright, Uncle Tom sings about."</p>
<p>"O, dear Miss Eva, dear Miss Eva!" said the child; "I will try, I will try; I never did care nothin' about it before."</p>
<p>St. Clare, at this instant, dropped the curtain. "It puts me in mind of mother," he said to Miss Ophelia. "It is true what she told me; if we want to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as Christ did,&#8212;call them to us, and <i>put our hands on them</i>."</p>
<p>"I've always had a prejudice against negroes," said Miss Ophelia, "and it's a fact, I never could bear to have that child touch me; but, I don't think she knew it."</p>
<p>"Trust any child to find that out," said St. Clare; "there's no keeping it from them. But I believe that all the trying in the world to benefit a child, and all the substantial favors you can do them, will never excite one emotion of gratitude, while that feeling of repugnance remains in the heart;&#8212;it's a queer kind of a fact,&#8212;but so it is."</p>
<p>"I don't know how I can help it," said Miss Ophelia; "they <i>are</i> disagreeable to me,&#8212;this child in particular,&#8212;how can I help feeling so?"</p>
<p>"Eva does, it seems."</p>
<p>"Well, she's so loving! After all, though, she's no more than Christ-like," said Miss Ophelia; "I wish I were like her. She might teach me a lesson."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be the first time a little child had been used to instruct an old disciple, if it <i>were</i> so," said St. Clare.</p>

<h6 id="dlepubid00054">Death</h6>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="intro">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In life's early morning, hath hid from our eyes.<a id="footref-19" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-19">[19]</a><br/>
</div>
<p>Eva's bed-room was a spacious apartment, which, like all the other rooms in the house, opened on to the broad verandah. The room communicated, on one side, with her father and mother's apartment; on the other, with that appropriated to Miss Ophelia. St. Clare had gratified his own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was intended. The windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white muslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in Paris, to a pattern of his own device, having round it a border of rose-buds and leaves, and a centre-piece with full-flown roses. The bedstead, chairs, and lounges, were of bamboo, wrought in peculiarly graceful and fanciful patterns. Over the head of the bed was an alabaster bracket, on which a beautiful sculptured angel stood, with drooping wings, holding out a crown of myrtle-leaves. From this depended, over the bed, light curtains of rose-colored gauze, striped with silver, supplying that protection from mosquitos which is an indispensable addition to all sleeping accommodation in that climate. The graceful bamboo lounges were amply supplied with cushions of rose-colored damask, while over them, depending from the hands of sculptured figures, were gauze curtains similar to those of the bed. A light, fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room, where a Parian vase, wrought in the shape of a white lily, with its buds, stood, ever filled with flowers. On this table lay Eva's books and little trinkets, with an elegantly wrought alabaster writing-stand, which her father had supplied to her when he saw her trying to improve herself in writing. There was a fireplace in the room, and on the marble mantle above stood a beautifully wrought statuette of Jesus receiving little children, and on either side marble vases, for which it was Tom's pride and delight to offer bouquets every morning. Two or three exquisite paintings of children, in various attitudes, embellished the wall. In short, the eye could turn nowhere without meeting images of childhood, of beauty, and of peace. Those little eyes never opened, in the morning light, without falling on something which suggested to the heart soothing and beautiful thoughts.</p>
<p>The deceitful strength which had buoyed Eva up for a little while was fast passing away; seldom and more seldom her light footstep was heard in the verandah, and oftener and oftener she was found reclined on a little lounge by the open window, her large, deep eyes fixed on the rising and falling waters of the lake.</p>
<p>It was towards the middle of the afternoon, as she was so reclining,&#8212;her Bible half open, her little transparent fingers lying listlessly between the leaves,&#8212;suddenly she heard her mother's voice, in sharp tones, in the verandah.</p>
<p>"What now, you baggage!&#8212;what new piece of mischief! You've been picking the flowers, hey?" and Eva heard the sound of a smart slap.</p>
<p>"Law, Missis! they 's for Miss Eva," she heard a voice say, which she knew belonged to Topsy.</p>
<p>"Miss Eva! A pretty excuse!&#8212;you suppose she wants <i>your</i> flowers, you good-for-nothing nigger! Get along off with you!"</p>
<p>In a moment, Eva was off from her lounge, and in the verandah.</p>
<p>"O, don't, mother! I should like the flowers; do give them to me; I want them!"</p>
<p>"Why, Eva, your room is full now."</p>
<p>"I can't have too many," said Eva. "Topsy, do bring them here."</p>
<p>Topsy, who had stood sullenly, holding down her head, now came up and offered her flowers. She did it with a look of hesitation and bashfulness, quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was usual with her.</p>
<p>"It's a beautiful bouquet!" said Eva, looking at it.</p>
<p>It was rather a singular one,&#8212;a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one single white japonica, with its glossy leaves. It was tied up with an evident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf had carefully been studied.</p>
<p>Topsy looked pleased, as Eva said,&#8212;"Topsy, you arrange flowers very prettily. Here," she said, "is this vase I haven't any flowers for. I wish you'd arrange something every day for it."</p>
<p>"Well, that's odd!" said Marie. "What in the world do you want that for?"</p>
<p>"Never mind, mamma; you'd as lief as not Topsy should do it,&#8212;had you not?"</p>
<p>"Of course, anything you please, dear! Topsy, you hear your young mistress;&#8212;see that you mind."</p>
<p>Topsy made a short courtesy, and looked down; and, as she turned away, Eva saw a tear roll down her dark cheek.</p>
<p>"You see, mamma, I knew poor Topsy wanted to do something for me," said Eva to her mother.</p>
<p>"O, nonsense! it's only because she likes to do mischief. She knows she mustn't pick flowers,&#8212;so she does it; that's all there is to it. But, if you fancy to have her pluck them, so be it."</p>
<p>"Mamma, I think Topsy is different from what she used to be; she's trying to be a good girl."</p>
<p>"She'll have to try a good while before <i>she</i> gets to be good," said Marie, with a careless laugh.</p>
<p>"Well, you know, mamma, poor Topsy! everything has always been against her."</p>
<p>"Not since she's been here, I'm sure. If she hasn't been talked to, and preached to, and every earthly thing done that anybody could do;&#8212;and she's just so ugly, and always will be; you can't make anything of the creature!"</p>
<p>"But, mamma, it's so different to be brought up as I've been, with so many friends, so many things to make me good and happy; and to be brought up as she's been, all the time, till she came here!"</p>
<p>"Most likely," said Marie, yawning,&#8212;"dear me, how hot it is!"</p>
<p>"Mamma, you believe, don't you, that Topsy could become an angel, as well as any of us, if she were a Christian?"</p>
<p>"Topsy! what a ridiculous idea! Nobody but you would ever think of it. I suppose she could, though."</p>
<p>"But, mamma, isn't God her father, as much as ours? Isn't Jesus her Saviour?"</p>
<p>"Well, that may be. I suppose God made everybody," said Marie. "Where is my smelling-bottle?"</p>
<p>"It's such a pity,&#8212;oh! <i>such</i> a pity!" said Eva, looking out on the distant lake, and speaking half to herself.</p>
<p>"What's a pity?" said Marie.</p>
<p>"Why, that any one, who could be a bright angel, and live with angels, should go all down, down down, and nobody help them!&#8212;oh dear!"</p>
<p>"Well, we can't help it; it's no use worrying, Eva! I don't know what's to be done; we ought to be thankful for our own advantages."</p>
<p>"I hardly can be," said Eva, "I'm so sorry to think of poor folks that haven't any."</p>
<p>"That's odd enough," said Marie;&#8212;"I'm sure my religion makes me thankful for my advantages."</p>
<p>"Mamma," said Eva, "I want to have some of my hair cut off,&#8212;a good deal of it."</p>
<p>"What for?" said Marie.</p>
<p>"Mamma, I want to give some away to my friends, while I am able to give it to them myself. Won't you ask aunty to come and cut it for me?"</p>
<p>Marie raised her voice, and called Miss Ophelia, from the other room.</p>
<p>The child half rose from her pillow as she came in, and, shaking down her long golden-brown curls, said, rather playfully, "Come aunty, shear the sheep!"</p>
<p>"What's that?" said St. Clare, who just then entered with some fruit he had been out to get for her.</p>
<p>"Papa, I just want aunty to cut off some of my hair;&#8212;there's too much of it, and it makes my head hot. Besides, I want to give some of it away."</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia came, with her scissors.</p>
<p>"Take care,&#8212;don't spoil the looks of it!" said her father; "cut underneath, where it won't show. Eva's curls are my pride."</p>
<p>"O, papa!" said Eva, sadly.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I want them kept handsome against the time I take you up to your uncle's plantation, to see Cousin Henrique," said St. Clare, in a gay tone.</p>
<p>"I shall never go there, papa;&#8212;I am going to a better country. O, do believe me! Don't you see, papa, that I get weaker, every day?"</p>
<p>"Why do you insist that I shall believe such a cruel thing, Eva?" said her father.</p>
<p>"Only because it is <i>true</i>, papa: and, if you will believe it now, perhaps you will get to feel about it as I do."</p>
<p>St. Clare closed his lips, and stood gloomily eying the long, beautiful curls, which, as they were separated from the child's head, were laid, one by one, in her lap. She raised them up, looked earnestly at them, twined them around her thin fingers, and looked from time to time, anxiously at her father.</p>
<p>"It's just what I've been foreboding!" said Marie; "it's just what has been preying on my health, from day to day, bringing me downward to the grave, though nobody regards it. I have seen this, long. St. Clare, you will see, after a while, that I was right."</p>
<p>"Which will afford you great consolation, no doubt!" said St. Clare, in a dry, bitter tone.</p>
<p>Marie lay back on a lounge, and covered her face with her cambric handkerchief.</p>
<p>Eva's clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other. It was the calm, comprehending gaze of a soul half loosed from its earthly bonds; it was evident she saw, felt, and appreciated, the difference between the two.</p>
<p>She beckoned with her hand to her father. He came and sat down by her.</p>
<p>"Papa, my strength fades away every day, and I know I must go. There are some things I want to say and do,&#8212;that I ought to do; and you are so unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject. But it must come; there's no putting it off. Do be willing I should speak now!"</p>
<p>"My child, I <i>am</i> willing!" said St. Clare, covering his eyes with one hand, and holding up Eva's hand with the other.</p>
<p>"Then, I want to see all our people together. I have some things I <i>must</i> say to them," said Eva.</p>
<p>"<i>Well</i>," said St. Clare, in a tone of dry endurance.</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia despatched a messenger, and soon the whole of the servants were convened in the room.</p>
<p>Eva lay back on her pillows; her hair hanging loosely about her face, her crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of her complexion and the thin contour of her limbs and features, and her large, soul-like eyes fixed earnestly on every one.</p>
<p>The servants were struck with a sudden emotion. The spiritual face, the long locks of hair cut off and lying by her, her father's averted face, and Marie's sobs, struck at once upon the feelings of a sensitive and impressible race; and, as they came in, they looked one on another, sighed, and shook their heads. There was a deep silence, like that of a funeral.</p>
<p>Eva raised herself, and looked long and earnestly round at every one. All looked sad and apprehensive. Many of the women hid their faces in their aprons.</p>
<p>"I sent for you all, my dear friends," said Eva, "because I love you. I love you all; and I have something to say to you, which I want you always to remember. . . . I am going to leave you. In a few more weeks you will see me no more&#8212;"</p>
<p>Here the child was interrupted by bursts of groans, sobs, and lamentations, which broke from all present, and in which her slender voice was lost entirely. She waited a moment, and then, speaking in a tone that checked the sobs of all, she said,</p>
<p>"If you love me, you must not interrupt me so. Listen to what I say. I want to speak to you about your souls. . . . Many of you, I am afraid, are very careless. You are thinking only about this world. I want you to remember that there is a beautiful world, where Jesus is. I am going there, and you can go there. It is for you, as much as me. But, if you want to go there, you must not live idle, careless, thoughtless lives. You must be Christians. You must remember that each one of you can become angels, and be angels forever. . . . If you want to be Christians, Jesus will help you. You must pray to him; you must read&#8212;"</p>
<p>The child checked herself, looked piteously at them, and said, sorrowfully,</p>
<p>"O dear! you <i>can't</i> read&#8212;poor souls!" and she hid her face in the pillow and sobbed, while many a smothered sob from those she was addressing, who were kneeling on the floor, aroused her.</p>
<p>"Never mind," she said, raising her face and smiling brightly through her tears, "I have prayed for you; and I know Jesus will help you, even if you can't read. Try all to do the best you can; pray every day; ask Him to help you, and get the Bible read to you whenever you can; and I think I shall see you all in heaven."</p>
<p>"Amen," was the murmured response from the lips of Tom and Mammy, and some of the elder ones, who belonged to the Methodist church. The younger and more thoughtless ones, for the time completely overcome, were sobbing, with their heads bowed upon their knees.</p>
<p>"I know," said Eva, "you all love me."</p>
<p>"Yes; oh, yes! indeed we do! Lord bless her!" was the involuntary answer of all.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know you do! There isn't one of you that hasn't always been very kind to me; and I want to give you something that, when you look at, you shall always remember me, I'm going to give all of you a curl of my hair; and, when you look at it, think that I loved you and am gone to heaven, and that I want to see you all there."</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe the scene, as, with tears and sobs, they gathered round the little creature, and took from her hands what seemed to them a last mark of her love. They fell on their knees; they sobbed, and prayed, and kissed the hem of her garment; and the elder ones poured forth words of endearment, mingled in prayers and blessings, after the manner of their susceptible race.</p>
<p>As each one took their gift, Miss Ophelia, who was apprehensive for the effect of all this excitement on her little patient, signed to each one to pass out of the apartment.</p>
<p>At last, all were gone but Tom and Mammy.</p>
<p>"Here, Uncle Tom," said Eva, "is a beautiful one for you. O, I am so happy, Uncle Tom, to think I shall see you in heaven,&#8212;for I'm sure I shall; and Mammy,&#8212;dear, good, kind Mammy!" she said, fondly throwing her arms round her old nurse,&#8212;"I know you'll be there, too."</p>
<p>"O, Miss Eva, don't see how I can live without ye, no how!" said the faithful creature. "'Pears like it's just taking everything off the place to oncet!" and Mammy gave way to a passion of grief.</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia pushed her and Tom gently from the apartment, and thought they were all gone; but, as she turned, Topsy was standing there.</p>
<p>"Where did you start up from?" she said, suddenly.</p>
<p>"I was here," said Topsy, wiping the tears from her eyes. "O, Miss Eva, I've been a bad girl; but won't you give <i>me</i> one, too?"</p>
<p>"Yes, poor Topsy! to be sure, I will. There&#8212;every time you look at that, think that I love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!"</p>
<p>"O, Miss Eva, I <i>is</i> tryin!" said Topsy, earnestly; "but, Lor, it's so hard to be good! 'Pears like I an't used to it, no ways!"</p>
<p>"Jesus knows it, Topsy; he is sorry for you; he will help you."</p>
<p>Topsy, with her eyes hid in her apron, was silently passed from the apartment by Miss Ophelia; but, as she went, she hid the precious curl in her bosom.</p>
<p>All being gone, Miss Ophelia shut the door. That worthy lady had wiped away many tears of her own, during the scene; but concern for the consequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in her mind.</p>
<p>St. Clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his hand shading his eyes, in the same attitude.</p>
<p>When they were all gone, he sat so still.</p>
<p>"Papa!" said Eva, gently, laying her hand on his.</p>
<p>He gave a sudden start and shiver; but made no answer.</p>
<p>"Dear papa!" said Eva.</p>
<p>"<i>I cannot</i>," said St. Clare, rising, "I <i>cannot</i> have it so! The Almighty hath dealt <i>very bitterly</i> with me!" and St. Clare pronounced these words with a bitter emphasis, indeed.</p>
<p>"Augustine! has not God a right to do what he will with his own?" said Miss Ophelia.</p>
<p>"Perhaps so; but that doesn't make it any easier to bear," said he, with a dry, hard, tearless manner, as he turned away.</p>
<p>"Papa, you break my heart!" said Eva, rising and throwing herself into his arms; "you must not feel so!" and the child sobbed and wept with a violence which alarmed them all, and turned her father's thoughts at once to another channel.</p>
<p>"There, Eva,&#8212;there, dearest! Hush! hush! I was wrong; I was wicked. I will feel any way, do any way,&#8212;only don't distress yourself; don't sob so. I will be resigned; I was wicked to speak as I did."</p>
<p>Eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her father's arms; and he, bending over her, soothed her by every tender word he could think of.</p>
<p>Marie rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her own, when she fell into violent hysterics.</p>
<p>"You didn't give me a curl, Eva," said her father, smiling sadly.</p>
<p>"They are all yours, papa," said she, smiling&#8212;"yours and mamma's; and you must give dear aunty as many as she wants. I only gave them to our poor people myself, because you know, papa, they might be forgotten when I am gone, and because I hoped it might help them remember. . . . You are a Christian, are you not, papa?" said Eva, doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask me?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. You are so good, I don't see how you can help it."</p>
<p>"What is being a Christian, Eva?"</p>
<p>"Loving Christ most of all," said Eva.</p>
<p>"Do you, Eva?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I do."</p>
<p>"You never saw him," said St. Clare.</p>
<p>"That makes no difference," said Eva. "I believe him, and in a few days I shall <i>see</i> him;" and the young face grew fervent, radiant with joy.</p>
<p>St. Clare said no more. It was a feeling which he had seen before in his mother; but no chord within vibrated to it.</p>
<p>Eva, after this, declined rapidly; there was no more any doubt of the event; the fondest hope could not be blinded. Her beautiful room was avowedly a sick room; and Miss Ophelia day and night performed the duties of a nurse,&#8212;and never did her friends appreciate her value more than in that capacity. With so well-trained a hand and eye, such perfect adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of sickness,&#8212;with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and direction of the doctors,&#8212;she was everything to him. They who had shrugged their shoulders at her little peculiarities and setnesses, so unlike the careless freedom of southern manners, acknowledged that now she was the exact person that was wanted.</p>
<p>Uncle Tom was much in Eva's room. The child suffered much from nervous restlessness, and it was a relief to her to be carried; and it was Tom's greatest delight to carry her little frail form in his arms, resting on a pillow, now up and down her room, now out into the verandah; and when the fresh sea-breezes blew from the lake,&#8212;and the child felt freshest in the morning,&#8212;he would sometimes walk with her under the orange-trees in the garden, or, sitting down in some of their old seats, sing to her their favorite old hymns.</p>
<p>Her father often did the same thing; but his frame was slighter, and when he was weary, Eva would say to him,</p>
<p>"O, papa, let Tom take me. Poor fellow! it pleases him; and you know it's all he can do now, and he wants to do something!"</p>
<p>"So do I, Eva!" said her father.</p>
<p>"Well, papa, you can do everything, and are everything to me. You read to me,&#8212;you sit up nights,&#8212;and Tom has only this one thing, and his singing; and I know, too, he does it easier than you can. He carries me so strong!"</p>
<p>The desire to do something was not confined to Tom. Every servant in the establishment showed the same feeling, and in their way did what they could.</p>
<p>Poor Mammy's heart yearned towards her darling; but she found no opportunity, night or day, as Marie declared that the state of her mind was such, it was impossible for her to rest; and, of course, it was against her principles to let any one else rest. Twenty times in a night, Mammy would be roused to rub her feet, to bathe her head, to find her pocket-handkerchief, to see what the noise was in Eva's room, to let down a curtain because it was too light, or to put it up because it was too dark; and, in the daytime, when she longed to have some share in the nursing of her pet, Marie seemed unusually ingenious in keeping her busy anywhere and everywhere all over the house, or about her own person; so that stolen interviews and momentary glimpses were all she could obtain.</p>
<p>"I feel it my duty to be particularly careful of myself, now," she would say, "feeble as I am, and with the whole care and nursing of that dear child upon me."</p>
<p>"Indeed, my dear," said St. Clare, "I thought our cousin relieved you of that."</p>
<p>"You talk like a man, St. Clare,&#8212;just as if a mother <i>could</i> be relieved of the care of a child in that state; but, then, it's all alike,&#8212;no one ever knows what I feel! I can't throw things off, as you do."</p>
<p>St. Clare smiled. You must excuse him, he couldn't help it,&#8212;for St. Clare could smile yet. For so bright and placid was the farewell voyage of the little spirit,&#8212;by such sweet and fragrant breezes was the small bark borne towards the heavenly shores,&#8212;that it was impossible to realize that it was death that was approaching. The child felt no pain,&#8212;only a tranquil, soft weakness, daily and almost insensibly increasing; and she was so beautiful, so loving, so trustful, so happy, that one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of innocence and peace which seemed to breathe around her. St. Clare found a strange calm coming over him. It was not hope,&#8212;that was impossible; it was not resignation; it was only a calm resting in the present, which seemed so beautiful that he wished to think of no future. It was like that hush of spirit which we feel amid the bright, mild woods of autumn, when the bright hectic flush is on the trees, and the last lingering flowers by the brook; and we joy in it all the more, because we know that soon it will all pass away.</p>
<p>The friend who knew most of Eva's own imaginings and foreshadowings was her faithful bearer, Tom. To him she said what she would not disturb her father by saying. To him she imparted those mysterious intimations which the soul feels, as the cords begin to unbind, ere it leaves its clay forever.</p>
<p>Tom, at last, would not sleep in his room, but lay all night in the outer verandah, ready to rouse at every call.</p>
<p>"Uncle Tom, what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and everywhere, like a dog, for?" said Miss Ophelia. "I thought you was one of the orderly sort, that liked to lie in bed in a Christian way."</p>
<p>"I do, Miss Feely," said Tom, mysteriously. "I do, but now&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Well, what now?"</p>
<p>"We mustn't speak loud; Mas'r St. Clare won't hear on 't; but Miss Feely, you know there must be somebody watchin' for the bridegroom."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Tom?"</p>
<p>"You know it says in Scripture, 'At midnight there was a great cry made. Behold, the bridegroom cometh.' That's what I'm spectin now, every night, Miss Feely,&#8212;and I couldn't sleep out o' hearin, no ways."</p>
<p>"Why, Uncle Tom, what makes you think so?"</p>
<p>"Miss Eva, she talks to me. The Lord, he sends his messenger in the soul. I must be thar, Miss Feely; for when that ar blessed child goes into the kingdom, they'll open the door so wide, we'll all get a look in at the glory, Miss Feely."</p>
<p>"Uncle Tom, did Miss Eva say she felt more unwell than usual tonight?"</p>
<p>"No; but she telled me, this morning, she was coming nearer,&#8212;thar's them that tells it to the child, Miss Feely. It's the angels,&#8212;'it's the trumpet sound afore the break o' day,'" said Tom, quoting from a favorite hymn.</p>
<p>This dialogue passed between Miss Ophelia and Tom, between ten and eleven, one evening, after her arrangements had all been made for the night, when, on going to bolt her outer door, she found Tom stretched along by it, in the outer verandah.</p>
<p>She was not nervous or impressible; but the solemn, heart-felt manner struck her. Eva had been unusually bright and cheerful, that afternoon, and had sat raised in her bed, and looked over all her little trinkets and precious things, and designated the friends to whom she would have them given; and her manner was more animated, and her voice more natural, than they had known it for weeks. Her father had been in, in the evening, and had said that Eva appeared more like her former self than ever she had done since her sickness; and when he kissed her for the night, he said to Miss Ophelia,&#8212;"Cousin, we may keep her with us, after all; she is certainly better;" and he had retired with a lighter heart in his bosom than he had had there for weeks.</p>
<p>But at midnight,&#8212;strange, mystic hour!&#8212;when the veil between the frail present and the eternal future grows thin,&#8212;then came the messenger!</p>
<p>There was a sound in that chamber, first of one who stepped quickly. It was Miss Ophelia, who had resolved to sit up all night with her little charge, and who, at the turn of the night, had discerned what experienced nurses significantly call "a change." The outer door was quickly opened, and Tom, who was watching outside, was on the alert, in a moment.</p>
<p>"Go for the doctor, Tom! lose not a moment," said Miss Ophelia; and, stepping across the room, she rapped at St. Clare's door.</p>
<p>"Cousin," she said, "I wish you would come."</p>
<p>Those words fell on his heart like clods upon a coffin. Why did they? He was up and in the room in an instant, and bending over Eva, who still slept.</p>
<p>What was it he saw that made his heart stand still? Why was no word spoken between the two? Thou canst say, who hast seen that same expression on the face dearest to thee;&#8212;that look indescribable, hopeless, unmistakable, that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer thine.</p>
<p>On the face of the child, however, there was no ghastly imprint,&#8212;only a high and almost sublime expression,&#8212;the overshadowing presence of spiritual natures, the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul.</p>
<p>They stood there so still, gazing upon her, that even the ticking of the watch seemed too loud. In a few moments, Tom returned, with the doctor. He entered, gave one look, and stood silent as the rest.</p>
<p>"When did this change take place?" said he, in a low whisper, to Miss Ophelia.</p>
<p>"About the turn of the night," was the reply.</p>
<p>Marie, roused by the entrance of the doctor, appeared, hurriedly, from the next room.</p>
<p>"Augustine! Cousin!&#8212;O!&#8212;what!" she hurriedly began.</p>
<p>"Hush!" said St. Clare, hoarsely; <i>"she is dying!"</i></p>
<p>Mammy heard the words, and flew to awaken the servants. The house was soon roused,&#8212;lights were seen, footsteps heard, anxious faces thronged the verandah, and looked tearfully through the glass doors; but St. Clare heard and said nothing,&#8212;he saw only <i>that look</i> on the face of the little sleeper.</p>
<p>"O, if she would only wake, and speak once more!" he said; and, stooping over her, he spoke in her ear,&#8212;"Eva, darling!"</p>
<p>The large blue eyes unclosed&#8212;a smile passed over her face;&#8212;she tried to raise her head, and to speak.</p>
<p>"Do you know me, Eva?"</p>
<p>"Dear papa," said the child, with a last effort, throwing her arms about his neck. In a moment they dropped again; and, as St. Clare raised his head, he saw a spasm of mortal agony pass over the face,&#8212;she struggled for breath, and threw up her little hands.</p>
<p>"O, God, this is dreadful!" he said, turning away in agony, and wringing Tom's hand, scarce conscious what he was doing. "O, Tom, my boy, it is killing me!"</p>
<p>Tom had his master's hands between his own; and, with tears streaming down his dark cheeks, looked up for help where he had always been used to look.</p>
<p>"Pray that this may be cut short!" said St. Clare,&#8212;"this wrings my heart."</p>
<p>"O, bless the Lord! it's over,&#8212;it's over, dear Master!" said Tom; "look at her."</p>
<p>The child lay panting on her pillows, as one exhausted,&#8212;the large clear eyes rolled up and fixed. Ah, what said those eyes, that spoke so much of heaven! Earth was past,&#8212;and earthly pain; but so solemn, so mysterious, was the triumphant brightness of that face, that it checked even the sobs of sorrow. They pressed around her, in breathless stillness.</p>
<p>"Eva," said St. Clare, gently.</p>
<p>She did not hear.</p>
<p>"O, Eva, tell us what you see! What is it?" said her father.</p>
<p>A bright, a glorious smile passed over her face, and she said, brokenly,&#8212;"O! love,&#8212;joy,&#8212;peace!" gave one sigh and passed from death unto life!</p>
<p>"Farewell, beloved child! the bright, eternal doors have closed after thee; we shall see thy sweet face no more. O, woe for them who watched thy entrance into heaven, when they shall wake and find only the cold gray sky of daily life, and thou gone forever!"</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00055">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00056">"This Is the Last of Earth"<a id="footref-20" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-20">[20]</a></h6>
<p>The statuettes and pictures in Eva's room were shrouded in white napkins, and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard there, and the light stole in solemnly through windows partially darkened by closed blinds.</p>
<p>The bed was draped in white; and there, beneath the drooping angel-figure, lay a little sleeping form,&#8212;sleeping never to waken!</p>
<p>There she lay, robed in one of the simple white dresses she had been wont to wear when living; the rose-colored light through the curtains cast over the icy coldness of death a warm glow. The heavy eyelashes drooped softly on the pure cheek; the head was turned a little to one side, as if in natural sleep, but there was diffused over every lineament of the face that high celestial expression, that mingling of rapture and repose, which showed it was no earthly or temporary sleep, but the long, sacred rest which "He giveth to his beloved."</p>
<p>There is no death to such as thou, dear Eva! neither darkness nor shadow of death; only such a bright fading as when the morning star fades in the golden dawn. Thine is the victory without the battle,&#8212;the crown without the conflict.</p>
<p>So did St. Clare think, as, with folded arms, he stood there gazing. Ah! who shall say what he did think? for, from the hour that voices had said, in the dying chamber, "she is gone," it had been all a dreary mist, a heavy "dimness of anguish." He had heard voices around him; he had had questions asked, and answered them; they had asked him when he would have the funeral, and where they should lay her; and he had answered, impatiently, that he cared not.</p>
<p>Adolph and Rosa had arranged the chamber; volatile, fickle and childish, as they generally were, they were soft-hearted and full of feeling; and, while Miss Ophelia presided over the general details of order and neatness, it was their hands that added those soft, poetic touches to the arrangements, that took from the death-room the grim and ghastly air which too often marks a New England funeral.</p>
<p>There were still flowers on the shelves,&#8212;all white, delicate and fragrant, with graceful, drooping leaves. Eva's little table, covered with white, bore on it her favorite vase, with a single white moss rose-bud in it. The folds of the drapery, the fall of the curtains, had been arranged and rearranged, by Adolph and Rosa, with that nicety of eye which characterizes their race. Even now, while St. Clare stood there thinking, little Rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a basket of white flowers. She stepped back when she saw St. Clare, and stopped respectfully; but, seeing that he did not observe her, she came forward to place them around the dead. St. Clare saw her as in a dream, while she placed in the small hands a fair cape jessamine, and, with admirable taste, disposed other flowers around the couch.</p>
<p>The door opened again, and Topsy, her eyes swelled with crying, appeared, holding something under her apron. Rosa made a quick forbidding gesture; but she took a step into the room.</p>
<p>"You must go out," said Rosa, in a sharp, positive whisper; "<i>you</i> haven't any business here!"</p>
<p>"O, do let me! I brought a flower,&#8212;such a pretty one!" said Topsy, holding up a half-blown tea rose-bud. "Do let me put just one there."</p>
<p>"Get along!" said Rosa, more decidedly.</p>
<p>"Let her stay!" said St. Clare, suddenly stamping his foot. "She shall come."</p>
<p>Rosa suddenly retreated, and Topsy came forward and laid her offering at the feet of the corpse; then suddenly, with a wild and bitter cry, she threw herself on the floor alongside the bed, and wept, and moaned aloud.</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia hastened into the room, and tried to raise and silence her; but in vain.</p>
<p>"O, Miss Eva! oh, Miss Eva! I wish I 's dead, too,&#8212;I do!"</p>
<p>There was a piercing wildness in the cry; the blood flushed into St. Clare's white, marble-like face, and the first tears he had shed since Eva died stood in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Get up, child," said Miss Ophelia, in a softened voice; "don't cry so. Miss Eva is gone to heaven; she is an angel."</p>
<p>"But I can't see her!" said Topsy. "I never shall see her!" and she sobbed again.</p>
<p>They all stood a moment in silence.</p>
<p>"<i>She</i> said she <i>loved</i> me," said Topsy,&#8212;"she did! O, dear! oh, dear! there an't <i>nobody</i> left now,&#8212;there an't!"</p>
<p>"That's true enough" said St. Clare; "but do," he said to Miss Ophelia, "see if you can't comfort the poor creature."</p>
<p>"I jist wish I hadn't never been born," said Topsy. "I didn't want to be born, no ways; and I don't see no use on 't."</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia raised her gently, but firmly, and took her from the room; but, as she did so, some tears fell from her eyes.</p>
<p>"Topsy, you poor child," she said, as she led her into her room, "don't give up! <i>I</i> can love you, though I am not like that dear little child. I hope I've learnt something of the love of Christ from her. I can love you; I do, and I'll try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl."</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia's voice was more than her words, and more than that were the honest tears that fell down her face. From that hour, she acquired an influence over the mind of the destitute child that she never lost.</p>
<p>"O, my Eva, whose little hour on earth did so much of good," thought St. Clare, "what account have I to give for my long years?"</p>
<p>There were, for a while, soft whisperings and footfalls in the chamber, as one after another stole in, to look at the dead; and then came the little coffin; and then there was a funeral, and carriages drove to the door, and strangers came and were seated; and there were white scarfs and ribbons, and crape bands, and mourners dressed in black crape; and there were words read from the Bible, and prayers offered; and St. Clare lived, and walked, and moved, as one who has shed every tear;&#8212;to the last he saw only one thing, that golden head in the coffin; but then he saw the cloth spread over it, the lid of the coffin closed; and he walked, when he was put beside the others, down to a little place at the bottom of the garden, and there, by the mossy seat where she and Tom had talked, and sung, and read so often, was the little grave. St. Clare stood beside it,&#8212;looked vacantly down; he saw them lower the little coffin; he heard, dimly, the solemn words, "I am the resurrection and the Life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;" and, as the earth was cast in and filled up the little grave, he could not realize that it was his Eva that they were hiding from his sight.</p>
<p>Nor was it!&#8212;not Eva, but only the frail seed of that bright, immortal form with which she shall yet come forth, in the day of the Lord Jesus!</p>
<p>And then all were gone, and the mourners went back to the place which should know her no more; and Marie's room was darkened, and she lay on the bed, sobbing and moaning in uncontrollable grief, and calling every moment for the attentions of all her servants. Of course, they had no time to cry,&#8212;why should they? the grief was <i>her</i> grief, and she was fully convinced that nobody on earth did, could, or would feel it as she did.</p>
<p>"St. Clare did not shed a tear," she said; "he didn't sympathize with her; it was perfectly wonderful to think how hard-hearted and unfeeling he was, when he must know how she suffered."</p>
<p>So much are people the slave of their eye and ear, that many of the servants really thought that Missis was the principal sufferer in the case, especially as Marie began to have hysterical spasms, and sent for the doctor, and at last declared herself dying; and, in the running and scampering, and bringing up hot bottles, and heating of flannels, and chafing, and fussing, that ensued, there was quite a diversion.</p>
<p>Tom, however, had a feeling at his own heart, that drew him to his master. He followed him wherever he walked, wistfully and sadly; and when he saw him sitting, so pale and quiet, in Eva's room, holding before his eyes her little open Bible, though seeing no letter or word of what was in it, there was more sorrow to Tom in that still, fixed, tearless eye, than in all Marie's moans and lamentations.</p>
<p>In a few days the St. Clare family were back again in the city; Augustine, with the restlessness of grief, longing for another scene, to change the current of his thoughts. So they left the house and garden, with its little grave, and came back to New Orleans; and St. Clare walked the streets busily, and strove to fill up the chasm in his heart with hurry and bustle, and change of place; and people who saw him in the street, or met him at the cafe, knew of his loss only by the weed on his hat; for there he was, smiling and talking, and reading the newspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business matters; and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre?</p>
<p>"Mr. St. Clare is a singular man," said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a complaining tone. "I used to think, if there was anything in the world he did love, it was our dear little Eva; but he seems to be forgetting her very easily. I cannot ever get him to talk about her. I really did think he would show more feeling!"</p>
<p>"Still waters run deepest, they used to tell me," said Miss Ophelia, oracularly.</p>
<p>"O, I don't believe in such things; it's all talk. If people have feeling, they will show it,&#8212;they can't help it; but, then, it's a great misfortune to have feeling. I'd rather have been made like St. Clare. My feelings prey upon me so!"</p>
<p>"Sure, Missis, Mas'r St. Clare is gettin' thin as a shader. They say, he don't never eat nothin'," said Mammy. "I know he don't forget Miss Eva; I know there couldn't nobody,&#8212;dear, little, blessed cretur!" she added, wiping her eyes.</p>
<p>"Well, at all events, he has no consideration for me," said Marie; "he hasn't spoken one word of sympathy, and he must know how much more a mother feels than any man can."</p>
<p>"The heart knoweth its own bitterness," said Miss Ophelia, gravely.</p>
<p>"That's just what I think. I know just what I feel,&#8212;nobody else seems to. Eva used to, but she is gone!" and Marie lay back on her lounge, and began to sob disconsolately.</p>
<p>Marie was one of those unfortunately constituted mortals, in whose eyes whatever is lost and gone assumes a value which it never had in possession. Whatever she had, she seemed to survey only to pick flaws in it; but, once fairly away, there was no end to her valuation of it.</p>
<p>While this conversation was taking place in the parlor another was going on in St. Clare's library.</p>
<p>Tom, who was always uneasily following his master about, had seen him go to his library, some hours before; and, after vainly waiting for him to come out, determined, at last, to make an errand in. He entered softly. St. Clare lay on his lounge, at the further end of the room. He was lying on his face, with Eva's Bible open before him, at a little distance. Tom walked up, and stood by the sofa. He hesitated; and, while he was hesitating, St. Clare suddenly raised himself up. The honest face, so full of grief, and with such an imploring expression of affection and sympathy, struck his master. He laid his hand on Tom's, and bowed down his forehead on it.</p>
<p>"O, Tom, my boy, the whole world is as empty as an egg-shell."</p>
<p>"I know it, Mas'r,&#8212;I know it," said Tom; "but, oh, if Mas'r could only look up,&#8212;up where our dear Miss Eva is,&#8212;up to the dear Lord Jesus!"</p>
<p>"Ah, Tom! I do look up; but the trouble is, I don't see anything, when I do, I wish I could."</p>
<p>Tom sighed heavily.</p>
<p>"It seems to be given to children, and poor, honest fellows, like you, to see what we can't," said St. Clare. "How comes it?"</p>
<p>"Thou has 'hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes,'" murmured Tom; "'even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.'"</p>
<p>"Tom, I don't believe,&#8212;I can't believe,&#8212;I've got the habit of doubting," said St. Clare. "I want to believe this Bible,&#8212;and I can't."</p>
<p>"Dear Mas'r, pray to the good Lord,&#8212;'Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.'"</p>
<p>"Who knows anything about anything?" said St. Clare, his eyes wandering dreamily, and speaking to himself. "Was all that beautiful love and faith only one of the ever-shifting phases of human feeling, having nothing real to rest on, passing away with the little breath? And is there no more Eva,&#8212;no heaven,&#8212;no Christ,&#8212;nothing?"</p>
<p>"O, dear Mas'r, there is! I know it; I'm sure of it," said Tom, falling on his knees. "Do, do, dear Mas'r, believe it!"</p>
<p>"How do you know there's any Christ, Tom! You never saw the Lord."</p>
<p>"Felt Him in my soul, Mas'r,&#8212;feel Him now! O, Mas'r, when I was sold away from my old woman and the children, I was jest a'most broke up. I felt as if there warn't nothin' left; and then the good Lord, he stood by me, and he says, 'Fear not, Tom;' and he brings light and joy in a poor feller's soul,&#8212;makes all peace; and I 's so happy, and loves everybody, and feels willin' jest to be the Lord's, and have the Lord's will done, and be put jest where the Lord wants to put me. I know it couldn't come from me, cause I 's a poor, complainin' cretur; it comes from the Lord; and I know He's willin' to do for Mas'r."</p>
<p>Tom spoke with fast-running tears and choking voice. St. Clare leaned his head on his shoulder, and wrung the hard, faithful, black hand.</p>
<p>"Tom, you love me," he said.</p>
<p>"I 's willin' to lay down my life, this blessed day, to see Mas'r a Christian."</p>
<p>"Poor, foolish boy!" said St. Clare, half-raising himself. "I'm not worth the love of one good, honest heart, like yours."</p>
<p>"O, Mas'r, dere's more than me loves you,&#8212;the blessed Lord Jesus loves you."</p>
<p>"How do you know that Tom?" said St. Clare.</p>
<p>"Feels it in my soul. O, Mas'r! 'the love of Christ, that passeth knowledge.'"</p>
<p>"Singular!" said St. Clare, turning away, "that the story of a man that lived and died eighteen hundred years ago can affect people so yet. But he was no man," he added, suddenly. "No man ever had such long and living power! O, that I could believe what my mother taught me, and pray as I did when I was a boy!"</p>
<p>"If Mas'r pleases," said Tom, "Miss Eva used to read this so beautifully. I wish Mas'r'd be so good as read it. Don't get no readin', hardly, now Miss Eva's gone."</p>
<p>The chapter was the eleventh of John,&#8212;the touching account of the raising of Lazarus, St. Clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. Tom knelt before him, with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of love, trust, adoration, on his quiet face.</p>
<p>"Tom," said his Master, "this is all <i>real</i> to you!"</p>
<p>"I can jest fairly <i>see</i> it Mas'r," said Tom.</p>
<p>"I wish I had your eyes, Tom."</p>
<p>"I wish, to the dear Lord, Mas'r had!"</p>
<p>"But, Tom, you know that I have a great deal more knowledge than you; what if I should tell you that I don't believe this Bible?"</p>
<p>"O, Mas'r!" said Tom, holding up his hands, with a deprecating gesture.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it shake your faith some, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Not a grain," said Tom.</p>
<p>"Why, Tom, you must know I know the most."</p>
<p>"O, Mas'r, haven't you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes? But Mas'r wasn't in earnest, for sartin, now?" said Tom, anxiously.</p>
<p>"No, Tom, I was not. I don't disbelieve, and I think there is reason to believe; and still I don't. It's a troublesome bad habit I've got, Tom."</p>
<p>"If Mas'r would only pray!"</p>
<p>"How do you know I don't, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Does Mas'r?"</p>
<p>"I would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray; but it's all speaking unto nothing, when I do. But come, Tom, you pray now, and show me how."</p>
<p>Tom's heart was full; he poured it out in prayer, like waters that have been long suppressed. One thing was plain enough; Tom thought there was somebody to hear, whether there were or not. In fact, St. Clare felt himself borne, on the tide of his faith and feeling, almost to the gates of that heaven he seemed so vividly to conceive. It seemed to bring him nearer to Eva.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my boy," said St. Clare, when Tom rose. "I like to hear you, Tom; but go, now, and leave me alone; some other time, I'll talk more."</p>
<p>Tom silently left the room.</p>
