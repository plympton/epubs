<p>"So ho!" said Legree to himself, "he thinks so, does he? How I hate these cursed Methodist hymns! Here, you nigger," said he, coming suddenly out upon Tom, and raising his riding-whip, "how dare you be gettin' up this yer row, when you ought to be in bed? Shut yer old black gash, and get along in with you!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mas'r," said Tom, with ready cheerfulness, as he rose to go in.</p>
<p>Legree was provoked beyond measure by Tom's evident happiness; and riding up to him, belabored him over his head and shoulders.</p>
<p>"There, you dog," he said, "see if you'll feel so comfortable, after that!"</p>
<p>But the blows fell now only on the outer man, and not, as before, on the heart. Tom stood perfectly submissive; and yet Legree could not hide from himself that his power over his bond thrall was somehow gone. And, as Tom disappeared in his cabin, and he wheeled his horse suddenly round, there passed through his mind one of those vivid flashes that often send the lightning of conscience across the dark and wicked soul. He understood full well that it was GOD who was standing between him and his victim, and he blasphemed him. That submissive and silent man, whom taunts, nor threats, nor stripes, nor cruelties, could disturb, roused a voice within him, such as of old his Master roused in the demoniac soul, saying, "What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?&#8212;art thou come to torment us before the time?"</p>
<p>Tom's whole soul overflowed with compassion and sympathy for the poor wretches by whom he was surrounded. To him it seemed as if his life-sorrows were now over, and as if, out of that strange treasury of peace and joy, with which he had been endowed from above, he longed to pour out something for the relief of their woes. It is true, opportunities were scanty; but, on the way to the fields, and back again, and during the hours of labor, chances fell in his way of extending a helping-hand to the weary, the disheartened and discouraged. The poor, worn-down, brutalized creatures, at first, could scarce comprehend this; but, when it was continued week after week, and month after month, it began to awaken long-silent chords in their benumbed hearts. Gradually and imperceptibly the strange, silent, patient man, who was ready to bear every one's burden, and sought help from none,&#8212;who stood aside for all, and came last, and took least, yet was foremost to share his little all with any who needed,&#8212;the man who, in cold nights, would give up his tattered blanket to add to the comfort of some woman who shivered with sickness, and who filled the baskets of the weaker ones in the field, at the terrible risk of coming short in his own measure,&#8212;and who, though pursued with unrelenting cruelty by their common tyrant, never joined in uttering a word of reviling or cursing,&#8212;this man, at last, began to have a strange power over them; and, when the more pressing season was past, and they were allowed again their Sundays for their own use, many would gather together to hear from him of Jesus. They would gladly have met to hear, and pray, and sing, in some place, together; but Legree would not permit it, and more than once broke up such attempts, with oaths and brutal execrations,&#8212;so that the blessed news had to circulate from individual to individual. Yet who can speak the simple joy with which some of those poor outcasts, to whom life was a joyless journey to a dark unknown, heard of a compassionate Redeemer and a heavenly home? It is the statement of missionaries, that, of all races of the earth, none have received the Gospel with such eager docility as the African. The principle of reliance and unquestioning faith, which is its foundation, is more a native element in this race than any other; and it has often been found among them, that a stray seed of truth, borne on some breeze of accident into hearts the most ignorant, has sprung up into fruit, whose abundance has shamed that of higher and more skilful culture.</p>
<p>The poor mulatto woman, whose simple faith had been well-nigh crushed and overwhelmed, by the avalanche of cruelty and wrong which had fallen upon her, felt her soul raised up by the hymns and passages of Holy Writ, which this lowly missionary breathed into her ear in intervals, as they were going to and returning from work; and even the half-crazed and wandering mind of Cassy was soothed and calmed by his simple and unobtrusive influences.</p>
<p>Stung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life, Cassy had often resolved in her soul an hour of retribution, when her hand should avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which she had been witness, or which <i>she</i> had in her own person suffered.</p>
<p>One night, after all in Tom's cabin were sunk in sleep, he was suddenly aroused by seeing her face at the hole between the logs, that served for a window. She made a silent gesture for him to come out.</p>
<p>Tom came out the door. It was between one and two o'clock at night,&#8212;broad, calm, still moonlight. Tom remarked, as the light of the moon fell upon Cassy's large, black eyes, that there was a wild and peculiar glare in them, unlike their wonted fixed despair.</p>
<p>"Come here, Father Tom," she said, laying her small hand on his wrist, and drawing him forward with a force as if the hand were of steel; "come here,&#8212;I've news for you."</p>
<p>"What, Misse Cassy?" said Tom, anxiously.</p>
<p>"Tom, wouldn't you like your liberty?"</p>
<p>"I shall have it, Misse, in God's time," said Tom. "Ay, but you may have it tonight," said Cassy, with a flash of sudden energy. "Come on."</p>
<p>Tom hesitated.</p>
<p>"Come!" said she, in a whisper, fixing her black eyes on him. "Come along! He's asleep&#8212;sound. I put enough into his brandy to keep him so. I wish I'd had more,&#8212;I shouldn't have wanted you. But come, the back door is unlocked; there's an axe there, I put it there,&#8212;his room door is open; I'll show you the way. I'd a done it myself, only my arms are so weak. Come along!"</p>
<p>"Not for ten thousand worlds, Misse!" said Tom, firmly, stopping and holding her back, as she was pressing forward.</p>
<p>"But think of all these poor creatures," said Cassy. "We might set them all free, and go somewhere in the swamps, and find an island, and live by ourselves; I've heard of its being done. Any life is better than this."</p>
<p>"No!" said Tom, firmly. "No! good never comes of wickedness. I'd sooner chop my right hand off!"</p>
<p>"Then <i>I</i> shall do it," said Cassy, turning.</p>
<p>"O, Misse Cassy!" said Tom, throwing himself before her, "for the dear Lord's sake that died for ye, don't sell your precious soul to the devil, that way! Nothing but evil will come of it. The Lord hasn't called us to wrath. We must suffer, and wait his time."</p>
<p>"Wait!" said Cassy. "Haven't I waited?&#8212;waited till my head is dizzy and my heart sick? What has he made me suffer? What has he made hundreds of poor creatures suffer? Isn't he wringing the life-blood out of you? I'm called on; they call me! His time's come, and I'll have his heart's blood!"</p>
<p>"No, no, no!" said Tom, holding her small hands, which were clenched with spasmodic violence. "No, ye poor, lost soul, that ye mustn't do. The dear, blessed Lord never shed no blood but his own, and that he poured out for us when we was enemies. Lord, help us to follow his steps, and love our enemies."</p>
<p>"Love!" said Cassy, with a fierce glare; "love <i>such</i> enemies! It isn't in flesh and blood."</p>
<p>"No, Misse, it isn't," said Tom, looking up; "but <i>He</i> gives it to us, and that's the victory. When we can love and pray over all and through all, the battle's past, and the victory's come,&#8212;glory be to God!" And, with streaming eyes and choking voice, the black man looked up to heaven.</p>
<p>And this, oh Africa! latest called of nations,&#8212;called to the crown of thorns, the scourge, the bloody sweat, the cross of agony,&#8212;this is to be <i>thy</i> victory; by this shalt thou reign with Christ when his kingdom shall come on earth.</p>
<p>The deep fervor of Tom's feelings, the softness of his voice, his tears, fell like dew on the wild, unsettled spirit of the poor woman. A softness gathered over the lurid fires of her eye; she looked down, and Tom could feel the relaxing muscles of her hands, as she said,</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you that evil spirits followed me? O! Father Tom, I can't pray,&#8212;I wish I could. I never have prayed since my children were sold! What you say must be right, I know it must; but when I try to pray, I can only hate and curse. I can't pray!"</p>
<p>"Poor soul!" said Tom, compassionately. "Satan desires to have ye, and sift ye as wheat. I pray the Lord for ye. O! Misse Cassy, turn to the dear Lord Jesus. He came to bind up the broken-hearted, and comfort all that mourn."</p>
<p>Cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast eyes.</p>
<p>"Misse Cassy," said Tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her in silence, "if ye only could get away from here,&#8212;if the thing was possible,&#8212;I'd 'vise ye and Emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go without blood-guiltiness,&#8212;not otherwise."</p>
<p>"Would you try it with us, Father Tom?"</p>
<p>"No," said Tom; "time was when I would; but the Lord's given me a work among these yer poor souls, and I'll stay with 'em and bear my cross with 'em till the end. It's different with you; it's a snare to you,&#8212;it's more'n you can stand,&#8212;and you'd better go, if you can."</p>
<p>"I know no way but through the grave," said Cassy. "There's no beast or bird but can find a home some where; even the snakes and the alligators have their places to lie down and be quiet; but there's no place for us. Down in the darkest swamps, their dogs will hunt us out, and find us. Everybody and everything is against us; even the very beasts side against us,&#8212;and where shall we go?"</p>
<p>Tom stood silent; at length he said,</p>
<p>"Him that saved Daniel in the den of lions,&#8212;that saved the children in the fiery furnace,&#8212;Him that walked on the sea, and bade the winds be still,&#8212;He's alive yet; and I've faith to believe he can deliver you. Try it, and I'll pray, with all my might, for you."</p>
<p>By what strange law of mind is it that an idea long overlooked, and trodden under foot as a useless stone, suddenly sparkles out in new light, as a discovered diamond?</p>
<p>Cassy had often revolved, for hours, all possible or probable schemes of escape, and dismissed them all, as hopeless and impracticable; but at this moment there flashed through her mind a plan, so simple and feasible in all its details, as to awaken an instant hope.</p>
<p>"Father Tom, I'll try it!" she said, suddenly.</p>
<p>"Amen!" said Tom; "the Lord help ye!"</p>

<div class="intro">"The way of the wicked is as darkness; he knoweth not at what he stumbleth."<a id="footref-27" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-27">[27]</a></div>
<p>The garret of the house that Legree occupied, like most other garrets, was a great, desolate space, dusty, hung with cobwebs, and littered with cast-off lumber. The opulent family that had inhabited the house in the days of its splendor had imported a great deal of splendid furniture, some of which they had taken away with them, while some remained standing desolate in mouldering, unoccupied rooms, or stored away in this place. One or two immense packing-boxes, in which this furniture was brought, stood against the sides of the garret. There was a small window there, which let in, through its dingy, dusty panes, a scanty, uncertain light on the tall, high-backed chairs and dusty tables, that had once seen better days. Altogether, it was a weird and ghostly place; but, ghostly as it was, it wanted not in legends among the superstitious negroes, to increase its terrors. Some few years before, a negro woman, who had incurred Legree's displeasure, was confined there for several weeks. What passed there, we do not say; the negroes used to whisper darkly to each other; but it was known that the body of the unfortunate creature was one day taken down from there, and buried; and, after that, it was said that oaths and cursings, and the sound of violent blows, used to ring through that old garret, and mingled with wailings and groans of despair. Once, when Legree chanced to overhear something of this kind, he flew into a violent passion, and swore that the next one that told stories about that garret should have an opportunity of knowing what was there, for he would chain them up there for a week. This hint was enough to repress talking, though, of course, it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least.</p>
<p>Gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the passage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house, from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude. It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for the purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellow-sufferer.</p>
<p>The sleeping-room of Cassy was directly under the garret. One day, without consulting Legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance. The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride.</p>
<p>"Hallo! you Cass!" said Legree, "what's in the wind now?"</p>
<p>"Nothing; only I choose to have another room," said Cassy, doggedly.</p>
<p>"And what for, pray?" said Legree.</p>
<p>"I choose to," said Cassy.</p>
<p>"The devil you do! and what for?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to get some sleep, now and then."</p>
<p>"Sleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?"</p>
<p>"I could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear," said Cassy, dryly.</p>
<p>"Speak out, you minx!" said Legree.</p>
<p>"O! nothing. I suppose it wouldn't disturb <i>you!</i> Only groans, and people scuffing, and rolling round on the garret floor, half the night, from twelve to morning!"</p>
<p>"People up garret!" said Legree, uneasily, but forcing a laugh; "who are they, Cassy?"</p>
<p>Cassy raised her sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of Legree, with an expression that went through his bones, as she said, "To be sure, Simon, who are they? I'd like to have <i>you</i> tell me. You don't know, I suppose!"</p>
<p>With an oath, Legree struck at her with his riding-whip; but she glided to one side, and passed through the door, and looking back, said, "If you'll sleep in that room, you'll know all about it. Perhaps you'd better try it!" and then immediately she shut and locked the door.</p>
<p>Legree blustered and swore, and threatened to break down the door; but apparently thought better of it, and walked uneasily into the sitting-room. Cassy perceived that her shaft had struck home; and, from that hour, with the most exquisite address, she never ceased to continue the train of influences she had begun.</p>
<p>In a knot-hole of the garret, that had opened, she had inserted the neck of an old bottle, in such a manner that when there was the least wind, most doleful and lugubrious wailing sounds proceeded from it, which, in a high wind, increased to a perfect shriek, such as to credulous and superstitious ears might easily seem to be that of horror and despair.</p>
<p>These sounds were, from time to time, heard by the servants, and revived in full force the memory of the old ghost legend. A superstitious creeping horror seemed to fill the house; and though no one dared to breathe it to Legree, he found himself encompassed by it, as by an atmosphere.</p>
<p>No one is so thoroughly superstitious as the godless man. The Christian is composed by the belief of a wise, all-ruling Father, whose presence fills the void unknown with light and order; but to the man who has dethroned God, the spirit-land is, indeed, in the words of the Hebrew poet, "a land of darkness and the shadow of death," without any order, where the light is as darkness. Life and death to him are haunted grounds, filled with goblin forms of vague and shadowy dread.</p>
<p>Legree had had the slumbering moral elements in him roused by his encounters with Tom,&#8212;roused, only to be resisted by the determinate force of evil; but still there was a thrill and commotion of the dark, inner world, produced by every word, or prayer, or hymn, that reacted in superstitious dread.</p>
<p>The influence of Cassy over him was of a strange and singular kind. He was her owner, her tyrant and tormentor. She was, as he knew, wholly, and without any possibility of help or redress, in his hands; and yet so it is, that the most brutal man cannot live in constant association with a strong female influence, and not be greatly controlled by it. When he first bought her, she was, as she said, a woman delicately bred; and then he crushed her, without scruple, beneath the foot of his brutality. But, as time, and debasing influences, and despair, hardened womanhood within her, and waked the fires of fiercer passions, she had become in a measure his mistress, and he alternately tyrannized over and dreaded her.</p>
<p>This influence had become more harassing and decided, since partial insanity had given a strange, weird, unsettled cast to all her words and language.</p>
<p>A night or two after this, Legree was sitting in the old sitting-room, by the side of a flickering wood fire, that threw uncertain glances round the room. It was a stormy, windy night, such as raises whole squadrons of nondescript noises in rickety old houses. Windows were rattling, shutters flapping, and wind carousing, rumbling, and tumbling down the chimney, and, every once in a while, puffing out smoke and ashes, as if a legion of spirits were coming after them. Legree had been casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hours, while Cassy sat in the corner; sullenly looking into the fire. Legree laid down his paper, and seeing an old book lying on the table, which he had noticed Cassy reading, the first part of the evening, took it up, and began to turn it over. It was one of those collections of stories of bloody murders, ghostly legends, and supernatural visitations, which, coarsely got up and illustrated, have a strange fascination for one who once begins to read them.</p>
<p>Legree poohed and pished, but read, turning page after page, till, finally, after reading some way, he threw down the book, with an oath.</p>
<p>"You don't believe in ghosts, do you, Cass?" said he, taking the tongs and settling the fire. "I thought you'd more sense than to let noises scare <i>you</i>."</p>
<p>"No matter what I believe," said Cassy, sullenly.</p>
<p>"Fellows used to try to frighten me with their yarns at sea," said Legree. "Never come it round me that way. I'm too tough for any such trash, tell ye."</p>
<p>Cassy sat looking intensely at him in the shadow of the corner. There was that strange light in her eyes that always impressed Legree with uneasiness.</p>
<p>"Them noises was nothing but rats and the wind," said Legree. "Rats will make a devil of a noise. I used to hear 'em sometimes down in the hold of the ship; and wind,&#8212;Lord's sake! ye can make anything out o' wind."</p>
<p>Cassy knew Legree was uneasy under her eyes, and, therefore, she made no answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that strange, unearthly expression, as before.</p>
<p>"Come, speak out, woman,&#8212;don't you think so?" said Legree.</p>
<p>"Can rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open a door when you've locked it and set a chair against it?" said Cassy; "and come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out their hand, so?"</p>
<p>Cassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on Legree, as she spoke, and he stared at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by laying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath.</p>
<p>"Woman! what do you mean? Nobody did?"</p>
<p>"O, no,&#8212;of course not,&#8212;did I say they did?" said Cassy, with a smile of chilling derision.</p>
<p>"But&#8212;did&#8212;have you really seen?&#8212;Come, Cass, what is it, now,&#8212;speak out!"</p>
<p>"You may sleep there, yourself," said Cassy, "if you want to know."</p>
<p>"Did it come from the garret, Cassy?"</p>
<p>"<i>It</i>,&#8212;what?" said Cassy.</p>
<p>"Why, what you told of&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I didn't tell you anything," said Cassy, with dogged sullenness.</p>
<p>Legree walked up and down the room, uneasily.</p>
<p>"I'll have this yer thing examined. I'll look into it, this very night. I'll take my pistols&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Do," said Cassy; "sleep in that room. I'd like to see you doing it. Fire your pistols,&#8212;do!"</p>
<p>Legree stamped his foot, and swore violently.</p>
<p>"Don't swear," said Cassy; "nobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark! What was that?"</p>
<p>"What?" said Legree, starting.</p>
<p>A heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began, and slowly struck twelve.</p>
<p>For some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague horror fell on him; while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her eyes, stood looking at him, counting the strokes.</p>
<p>"Twelve o'clock; well <i>now</i> we'll see," said she, turning, and opening the door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening.</p>
<p>"Hark! What's that?" said she, raising her finger.</p>
<p>"It's only the wind," said Legree. "Don't you hear how cursedly it blows?"</p>
<p>"Simon, come here," said Cassy, in a whisper, laying her hand on his, and leading him to the foot of the stairs: "do you know what <i>that</i> is? Hark!"</p>
<p>A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret. Legree's knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear.</p>
<p>"Hadn't you better get your pistols?" said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree's blood. "It's time this thing was looked into, you know. I'd like to have you go up now; <i>they're at it</i>."</p>
<p>"I won't go!" said Legree, with an oath.</p>
<p>"Why not? There an't any such thing as ghosts, you know! Come!" and Cassy flitted up the winding stairway, laughing, and looking back after him. "Come on."</p>
<p>"I believe you <i>are</i> the devil!" said Legree. "Come back you hag,&#8212;come back, Cass! You shan't go!"</p>
<p>But Cassy laughed wildly, and fled on. He heard her open the entry doors that led to the garret. A wild gust of wind swept down, extinguishing the candle he held in his hand, and with it the fearful, unearthly screams; they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear.</p>
<p>Legree fled frantically into the parlor, whither, in a few moments, he was followed by Cassy, pale, calm, cold as an avenging spirit, and with that same fearful light in her eye.</p>
<p>"I hope you are satisfied," said she.</p>
<p>"Blast you, Cass!" said Legree.</p>
<p>"What for?" said Cassy. "I only went up and shut the doors. <i>What's the matter with that garret</i>, Simon, do you suppose?" said she.</p>
<p>"None of your business!" said Legree.</p>
<p>"O, it an't? Well," said Cassy, "at any rate, I'm glad <i>I</i> don't sleep under it."</p>
<p>Anticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, Cassy had been up and opened the garret window. Of course, the moment the doors were opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light.</p>
<p>This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree, until he would sooner have put his head into a lion's mouth than to have explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and Emmeline's wardrobe. All things being arranged, they only waited a fitting opportunity to put their plan in execution.</p>
<p>By cajoling Legree, and taking advantage of a good-natured interval, Cassy had got him to take her with him to the neighboring town, which was situated directly on the Red River. With a memory sharpened to almost preternatural clearness, she remarked every turn in the road, and formed a mental estimate of the time to be occupied in traversing it.</p>
<p>At the time when all was matured for action, our readers may, perhaps, like to look behind the scenes, and see the final <i>coup d'etat</i>.</p>
<p>It was now near evening, Legree had been absent, on a ride to a neighboring farm. For many days Cassy had been unusually gracious and accommodating in her humors; and Legree and she had been, apparently, on the best of terms. At present, we may behold her and Emmeline in the room of the latter, busy in sorting and arranging two small bundles.</p>
<p>"There, these will be large enough," said Cassy. "Now put on your bonnet, and let's start; it's just about the right time."</p>
<p>"Why, they can see us yet," said Emmeline.</p>
<p>"I mean they shall," said Cassy, coolly. "Don't you know that they must have their chase after us, at any rate? The way of the thing is to be just this:&#8212;We will steal out of the back door, and run down by the quarters. Sambo or Quimbo will be sure to see us. They will give chase, and we will get into the swamp; then, they can't follow us any further till they go up and give the alarm, and turn out the dogs, and so on; and, while they are blundering round, and tumbling over each other, as they always do, you and I will slip along to the creek, that runs back of the house, and wade along in it, till we get opposite the back door. That will put the dogs all at fault; for scent won't lie in the water. Every one will run out of the house to look after us, and then we'll whip in at the back door, and up into the garret, where I've got a nice bed made up in one of the great boxes. We must stay in that garret a good while, for, I tell you, he will raise heaven and earth after us. He'll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and have a great hunt; and they'll go over every inch of ground in that swamp. He makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him. So let him hunt at his leisure."</p>
<p>"Cassy, how well you have planned it!" said Emmeline. "Who ever would have thought of it, but you?"</p>
<p>There was neither pleasure nor exultation in Cassy's eyes,&#8212;only a despairing firmness.</p>
<p>"Come," she said, reaching her hand to Emmeline.</p>
<p>The two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house, and flitted, through the gathering shadows of evening, along by the quarters. The crescent moon, set like a silver signet in the western sky, delayed a little the approach of night. As Cassy expected, when quite near the verge of the swamps that encircled the plantation, they heard a voice calling to them to stop. It was not Sambo, however, but Legree, who was pursuing them with violent execrations. At the sound, the feebler spirit of Emmeline gave way; and, laying hold of Cassy's arm, she said, "O, Cassy, I'm going to faint!"</p>
<p>"If you do, I'll kill you!" said Cassy, drawing a small, glittering stiletto, and flashing it before the eyes of the girl.</p>
<p>The diversion accomplished the purpose. Emmeline did not faint, and succeeded in plunging, with Cassy, into a part of the labyrinth of swamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for Legree to think of following them, without assistance.</p>
<p>"Well," said he, chuckling brutally; "at any rate, they've got themselves into a trap now&#8212;the baggage! They're safe enough. They shall sweat for it!"</p>
<p>"Hulloa, there! Sambo! Quimbo! All hands!" called Legree, coming to the quarters, when the men and women were just returning from work. "There's two runaways in the swamps. I'll give five dollars to any nigger as catches 'em. Turn out the dogs! Turn out Tiger, and Fury, and the rest!"</p>
<p>The sensation produced by this news was immediate. Many of the men sprang forward, officiously, to offer their services, either from the hope of the reward, or from that cringing subserviency which is one of the most baleful effects of slavery. Some ran one way, and some another. Some were for getting flambeaux of pine-knots. Some were uncoupling the dogs, whose hoarse, savage bay added not a little to the animation of the scene.</p>
<p>"Mas'r, shall we shoot 'em, if can't cotch 'em?" said Sambo, to whom his master brought out a rifle.</p>
<p>"You may fire on Cass, if you like; it's time she was gone to the devil, where she belongs; but the gal, not," said Legree. "And now, boys, be spry and smart. Five dollars for him that gets 'em; and a glass of spirits to every one of you, anyhow."</p>
<p>The whole band, with the glare of blazing torches, and whoop, and shout, and savage yell, of man and beast, proceeded down to the swamp, followed, at some distance, by every servant in the house. The establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and Emmeline glided into it the back way. The whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room windows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux, just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp.</p>
<p>"See there!" said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy; "the hunt is begun! Look how those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Don't you hear? If we were only <i>there</i>, our chances wouldn't be worth a picayune. O, for pity's sake, do let's hide ourselves. Quick!"</p>
<p>"There's no occasion for hurry," said Cassy, coolly; "they are all out after the hunt,&#8212;that's the amusement of the evening! We'll go up stairs, by and by. Meanwhile," said she, deliberately taking a key from the pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his hurry, "meanwhile I shall take something to pay our passage."</p>
<p>She unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted over rapidly.</p>
<p>"O, don't let's do that!" said Emmeline.</p>
<p>"Don't!" said Cassy; "why not? Would you have us starve in the swamps, or have that that will pay our way to the free states. Money will do anything, girl." And, as she spoke, she put the money in her bosom.</p>
<p>"It would be stealing," said Emmeline, in a distressed whisper.</p>
<p>"Stealing!" said Cassy, with a scornful laugh. "They who steal body and soul needn't talk to us. Every one of these bills is stolen,&#8212;stolen from poor, starving, sweating creatures, who must go to the devil at last, for his profit. Let <i>him</i> talk about stealing! But come, we may as well go up garret; I've got a stock of candles there, and some books to pass away the time. You may be pretty sure they won't come <i>there</i> to inquire after us. If they do, I'll play ghost for them."</p>
<p>When Emmeline reached the garret, she found an immense box, in which some heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought, turned on its side, so that the opening faced the wall, or rather the eaves. Cassy lit a small lamp, and creeping round under the eaves, they established themselves in it. It was spread with a couple of small mattresses and some pillows; a box near by was plentifully stored with candles, provisions, and all the clothing necessary to their journey, which Cassy had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass.</p>
<p>"There," said Cassy, as she fixed the lamp into a small hook, which she had driven into the side of the box for that purpose; "this is to be our home for the present. How do you like it?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure they won't come and search the garret?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to see Simon Legree doing that," said Cassy. "No, indeed; he will be too glad to keep away. As to the servants, they would any of them stand and be shot, sooner than show their faces here."</p>
<p>Somewhat reassured, Emmeline settled herself back on her pillow.</p>
<p>"What did you mean, Cassy, by saying you would kill me?" she said, simply.</p>
<p>"I meant to stop your fainting," said Cassy, "and I did do it. And now I tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind <i>not</i> to faint, let what will come; there's no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped you, that wretch might have had his hands on you now."</p>
<p>Emmeline shuddered.</p>
<p>The two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a French book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze, and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses' feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a faint shriek.</p>
<p>"Only the hunt coming back," said Cassy, coolly; "never fear. Look out of this knot-hole. Don't you see 'em all down there? Simon has to give up, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. Ah, my good sir, you'll have to try the race again and again,&#8212;the game isn't there."</p>
<p>"O, don't speak a word!" said Emmeline; "what if they should hear you?"</p>
<p>"If they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep away," said Cassy. "No danger; we may make any noise we please, and it will only add to the effect."</p>
<p>At length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house. Legree, cursing his ill luck, and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow, went to bed.</p>

<p>The longest way must have its close,&#8212;the gloomiest night will wear on to a morning. An eternal, inexorable lapse of moments is ever hurrying the day of the evil to an eternal night, and the night of the just to an eternal day. We have walked with our humble friend thus far in the valley of slavery; first through flowery fields of ease and indulgence, then through heart-breaking separations from all that man holds dear. Again, we have waited with him in a sunny island, where generous hands concealed his chains with flowers; and, lastly, we have followed him when the last ray of earthly hope went out in night, and seen how, in the blackness of earthly darkness, the firmament of the unseen has blazed with stars of new and significant lustre.</p>
<p>The morning-star now stands over the tops of the mountains, and gales and breezes, not of earth, show that the gates of day are unclosing.</p>
<p>The escape of Cassy and Emmeline irritated the before surly temper of Legree to the last degree; and his fury, as was to be expected, fell upon the defenceless head of Tom. When he hurriedly announced the tidings among his hands, there was a sudden light in Tom's eye, a sudden upraising of his hands, that did not escape him. He saw that he did not join the muster of the pursuers. He thought of forcing him to do it; but, having had, of old, experience of his inflexibility when commanded to take part in any deed of inhumanity, he would not, in his hurry, stop to enter into any conflict with him.</p>
<p>Tom, therefore, remained behind, with a few who had learned of him to pray, and offered up prayers for the escape of the fugitives.</p>
<p>When Legree returned, baffled and disappointed, all the long-working hatred of his soul towards his slave began to gather in a deadly and desperate form. Had not this man braved him,&#8212;steadily, powerfully, resistlessly,&#8212;ever since he bought him? Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?</p>
<p>"I <i>hate</i> him!" said Legree, that night, as he sat up in his bed; "I <i>hate</i> him! And isn't he MINE? Can't I do what I like with him? Who's to hinder, I wonder?" And Legree clenched his fist, and shook it, as if he had something in his hands that he could rend in pieces.</p>
<p>But, then, Tom was a faithful, valuable servant; and, although Legree hated him the more for that, yet the consideration was still somewhat of a restraint to him.</p>
<p>The next morning, he determined to say nothing, as yet; to assemble a party, from some neighboring plantations, with dogs and guns; to surround the swamp, and go about the hunt systematically. If it succeeded, well and good; if not, he would summon Tom before him, and&#8212;his teeth clenched and his blood boiled&#8212;<i>then</i> he would break the fellow down, or&#8212;there was a dire inward whisper, to which his soul assented.</p>
<p>Ye say that the <i>interest</i> of the master is a sufficient safeguard for the slave. In the fury of man's mad will, he will wittingly, and with open eye, sell his own soul to the devil to gain his ends; and will he be more careful of his neighbor's body?</p>
<p>"Well," said Cassy, the next day, from the garret, as she reconnoitred through the knot-hole, "the hunt's going to begin again, today!"</p>
<p>Three or four mounted horsemen were curvetting about, on the space in front of the house; and one or two leashes of strange dogs were struggling with the negroes who held them, baying and barking at each other.</p>
<p>The men are, two of them, overseers of plantations in the vicinity; and others were some of Legree's associates at the tavern-bar of a neighboring city, who had come for the interest of the sport. A more hard-favored set, perhaps, could not be imagined. Legree was serving brandy, profusely, round among them, as also among the negroes, who had been detailed from the various plantations for this service; for it was an object to make every service of this kind, among the negroes, as much of a holiday as possible.</p>
<p>Cassy placed her ear at the knot-hole; and, as the morning air blew directly towards the house, she could overhear a good deal of the conversation. A grave sneer overcast the dark, severe gravity of her face, as she listened, and heard them divide out the ground, discuss the rival merits of the dogs, give orders about firing, and the treatment of each, in case of capture.</p>
<p>Cassy drew back; and, clasping her hands, looked upward, and said, "O, great Almighty God! we are <i>all</i> sinners; but what have <i>we</i> done, more than all the rest of the world, that we should be treated so?"</p>
<p>There was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice, as she spoke.</p>
<p>"If it wasn't for <i>you</i>, child," she said, looking at Emmeline, "I'd <i>go</i> out to them; and I'd thank any one of them that <i>would</i> shoot me down; for what use will freedom be to me? Can it give me back my children, or make me what I used to be?"</p>
<p>Emmeline, in her child-like simplicity, was half afraid of the dark moods of Cassy. She looked perplexed, but made no answer. She only took her hand, with a gentle, caressing movement.</p>
<p>"Don't!" said Cassy, trying to draw it away; "you'll get me to loving you; and I never mean to love anything, again!"</p>
<p>"Poor Cassy!" said Emmeline, "don't feel so! If the Lord gives us liberty, perhaps he'll give you back your daughter; at any rate, I'll be like a daughter to you. I know I'll never see my poor old mother again! I shall love you, Cassy, whether you love me or not!"</p>
<p>The gentle, child-like spirit conquered. Cassy sat down by her, put her arm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair; and Emmeline then wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes, now soft with tears.</p>
<p>"O, Em!" said Cassy, "I've hungered for my children, and thirsted for them, and my eyes fail with longing for them! Here! here!" she said, striking her breast, "it's all desolate, all empty! If God would give me back my children, then I could pray."</p>
<p>"You must trust him, Cassy," said Emmeline; "he is our Father!"</p>
<p>"His wrath is upon us," said Cassy; "he has turned away in anger."</p>
<p>"No, Cassy! He will be good to us! Let us hope in Him," said Emmeline,&#8212;"I always have had hope."</p>
<p>The hunt was long, animated, and thorough, but unsuccessful; and, with grave, ironic exultation, Cassy looked down on Legree, as, weary and dispirited, he alighted from his horse.</p>
<p>"Now, Quimbo," said Legree, as he stretched himself down in the sitting-room, "you jest go and walk that Tom up here, right away! The old cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter; and I'll have it out of his old black hide, or I'll know the reason why!"</p>
<p>Sambo and Quimbo, both, though hating each other, were joined in one mind by a no less cordial hatred of Tom. Legree had told them, at first, that he had bought him for a general overseer, in his absence; and this had begun an ill will, on their part, which had increased, in their debased and servile natures, as they saw him becoming obnoxious to their master's displeasure. Quimbo, therefore, departed, with a will, to execute his orders.</p>
<p>Tom heard the message with a forewarning heart; for he knew all the plan of the fugitives' escape, and the place of their present concealment;&#8212;he knew the deadly character of the man he had to deal with, and his despotic power. But he felt strong in God to meet death, rather than betray the helpless.</p>
<p>He sat his basket down by the row, and, looking up, said, "Into thy hands I commend my spirit! Thou hast redeemed me, oh Lord God of truth!" and then quietly yielded himself to the rough, brutal grasp with which Quimbo seized him.</p>
<p>"Ay, ay!" said the giant, as he dragged him along; "ye'll cotch it, now! I'll boun' Mas'r's back 's up <i>high!</i> No sneaking out, now! Tell ye, ye'll get it, and no mistake! See how ye'll look, now, helpin' Mas'r's niggers to run away! See what ye'll get!"</p>
<p>The savage words none of them reached that ear!&#8212;a higher voice there was saying, "Fear not them that kill the body, and, after that, have no more that they can do." Nerve and bone of that poor man's body vibrated to those words, as if touched by the finger of God; and he felt the strength of a thousand souls in one. As he passed along, the trees and bushes, the huts of his servitude, the whole scene of his degradation, seemed to whirl by him as the landscape by the rushing ear. His soul throbbed,&#8212;his home was in sight,&#8212;and the hour of release seemed at hand.</p>
<p>"Well, Tom!" said Legree, walking up, and seizing him grimly by the collar of his coat, and speaking through his teeth, in a paroxysm of determined rage, "do you know I've made up my mind to KILL YOU?"</p>
<p>"It's very likely, Mas'r," said Tom, calmly.</p>
<p>"I <i>have</i>," said Legree, with a grim, terrible calmness, "<i>done&#8212;just&#8212;that&#8212;thing</i>, Tom, unless you'll tell me what you know about these yer gals!"</p>
<p>Tom stood silent.</p>
<p>"D'ye hear?" said Legree, stamping, with a roar like that of an incensed lion. "Speak!"</p>
<p>"<i>I han't got nothing to tell, Mas'r</i>," said Tom, with a slow, firm, deliberate utterance.</p>
<p>"Do you dare to tell me, ye old black Christian, ye don't <i>know</i>?" said Legree.</p>
<p>Tom was silent.</p>
<p>"Speak!" thundered Legree, striking him furiously. "Do you know anything?"</p>
<p>"I know, Mas'r; but I can't tell anything. <i>I can die!</i>"</p>
<p>Legree drew in a long breath; and, suppressing his rage, took Tom by the arm, and, approaching his face almost to his, said, in a terrible voice, "Hark 'e, Tom!&#8212;ye think, 'cause I've let you off before, I don't mean what I say; but, this time, <i>I've made up my mind</i>, and counted the cost. You've always stood it out again' me: now, <i>I'll conquer ye, or kill ye!</i>&#8212;one or t' other. I'll count every drop of blood there is in you, and take 'em, one by one, till ye give up!"</p>
<p>Tom looked up to his master, and answered, "Mas'r, if you was sick, or in trouble, or dying, and I could save ye, I'd <i>give</i> ye my heart's blood; and, if taking every drop of blood in this poor old body would save your precious soul, I'd give 'em freely, as the Lord gave his for me. O, Mas'r! don't bring this great sin on your soul! It will hurt you more than 't will me! Do the worst you can, my troubles'll be over soon; but, if ye don't repent, yours won't <i>never</i> end!"</p>
<p>Like a strange snatch of heavenly music, heard in the lull of a tempest, this burst of feeling made a moment's blank pause. Legree stood aghast, and looked at Tom; and there was such a silence, that the tick of the old clock could be heard, measuring, with silent touch, the last moments of mercy and probation to that hardened heart.</p>
<p>It was but a moment. There was one hesitating pause,&#8212;one irresolute, relenting thrill,&#8212;and the spirit of evil came back, with seven-fold vehemence; and Legree, foaming with rage, smote his victim to the ground.</p>
<p>Scenes of blood and cruelty are shocking to our ear and heart. What man has nerve to do, man has not nerve to hear. What brother-man and brother-Christian must suffer, cannot be told us, even in our secret chamber, it so harrows the soul! And yet, oh my country! these things are done under the shadow of thy laws! O, Christ! thy church sees them, almost in silence!</p>
<p>But, of old, there was One whose suffering changed an instrument of torture, degradation and shame, into a symbol of glory, honor, and immortal life; and, where His spirit is, neither degrading stripes, nor blood, nor insults, can make the Christian's last struggle less than glorious.</p>
<p>Was he alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing up, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?</p>
<p>Nay! There stood by him ONE,&#8212;seen by him alone,&#8212;"like unto the Son of God."</p>
<p>The tempter stood by him, too,&#8212;blinded by furious, despotic will,&#8212;every moment pressing him to shun that agony by the betrayal of the innocent. But the brave, true heart was firm on the Eternal Rock. Like his Master, he knew that, if he saved others, himself he could not save; nor could utmost extremity wring from him words, save of prayers and holy trust.</p>
<p>"He's most gone, Mas'r," said Sambo, touched, in spite of himself, by the patience of his victim.</p>
<p>"Pay away, till he gives up! Give it to him!&#8212;give it to him!" shouted Legree. "I'll take every drop of blood he has, unless he confesses!"</p>
<p>Tom opened his eyes, and looked upon his master. "Ye poor miserable critter!" he said, "there ain't no more ye can do! I forgive ye, with all my soul!" and he fainted entirely away.</p>
<p>"I b'lieve, my soul, he's done for, finally," said Legree, stepping forward, to look at him. "Yes, he is! Well, his mouth's shut up, at last,&#8212;that's one comfort!"</p>
<p>Yes, Legree; but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul? that soul, past repentance, past prayer, past hope, in whom the fire that never shall be quenched is already burning!</p>
<p>Yet Tom was not quite gone. His wondrous words and pious prayers had struck upon the hearts of the imbruted blacks, who had been the instruments of cruelty upon him; and, the instant Legree withdrew, they took him down, and, in their ignorance, sought to call him back to life,&#8212;as if <i>that</i> were any favor to him.</p>
<p>"Sartin, we 's been doin' a drefful wicked thing!" said Sambo; "hopes Mas'r'll have to 'count for it, and not we."</p>
<p>They washed his wounds,&#8212;they provided a rude bed, of some refuse cotton, for him to lie down on; and one of them, stealing up to the house, begged a drink of brandy of Legree, pretending that he was tired, and wanted it for himself. He brought it back, and poured it down Tom's throat.</p>
<p>"O, Tom!" said Quimbo, "we's been awful wicked to ye!"</p>
<p>"I forgive ye, with all my heart!" said Tom, faintly.</p>
<p>"O, Tom! do tell us who is <i>Jesus</i>, anyhow?" said Sambo;&#8212;"Jesus, that's been a standin' by you so, all this night!&#8212;Who is he?"</p>
<p>The word roused the failing, fainting spirit. He poured forth a few energetic sentences of that wondrous One,&#8212;his life, his death, his everlasting presence, and power to save.</p>
<p>They wept,&#8212;both the two savage men.</p>
<p>"Why didn't I never hear this before?" said Sambo; "but I do believe!&#8212;I can't help it! Lord Jesus, have mercy on us!"</p>
<p>"Poor critters!" said Tom, "I'd be willing to bar all I have, if it'll only bring ye to Christ! O, Lord! give me these two more souls, I pray!"</p>
<p>That prayer was answered!</p>
