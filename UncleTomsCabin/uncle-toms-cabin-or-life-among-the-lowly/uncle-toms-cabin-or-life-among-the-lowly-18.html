<h6 id="dlepubid00084">The Young Master</h6>
<p>Two days after, a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of China trees, and, throwing the reins hastily on the horse's neck, sprang out and inquired for the owner of the place.</p>
<p>It was George Shelby; and, to show how he came to be there, we must go back in our story.</p>
<p>The letter of Miss Ophelia to Mrs. Shelby had, by some unfortunate accident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote post-office, before it reached its destination; and, of course, before it was received, Tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the Red River.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern; but any immediate action upon it was an impossibility. She was then in attendance on the sick-bed of her husband, who lay delirious in the crisis of a fever. Master George Shelby, who, in the interval, had changed from a boy to a tall young man, was her constant and faithful assistant, and her only reliance in superintending his father's affairs. Miss Ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the lawyer who did business for the St. Clares; and the most that, in the emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to him. The sudden death of Mr. Shelby, a few days after, brought, of course, an absorbing pressure of other interests, for a season.</p>
<p>Mr. Shelby showed his confidence in his wife's ability, by appointing her sole executrix upon his estates; and thus immediately a large and complicated amount of business was brought upon her hands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelby, with characteristic energy, applied herself to the work of straightening the entangled web of affairs; and she and George were for some time occupied with collecting and examining accounts, selling property and settling debts; for Mrs. Shelby was determined that everything should be brought into tangible and recognizable shape, let the consequences to her prove what they might. In the mean time, they received a letter from the lawyer to whom Miss Ophelia had referred them, saying that he knew nothing of the matter; that the man was sold at a public auction, and that, beyond receiving the money, he knew nothing of the affair.</p>
<p>Neither George nor Mrs. Shelby could be easy at this result; and, accordingly, some six months after, the latter, having business for his mother, down the river, resolved to visit New Orleans, in person, and push his inquiries, in hopes of discovering Tom's whereabouts, and restoring him.</p>
<p>After some months of unsuccessful search, by the merest accident, George fell in with a man, in New Orleans, who happened to be possessed of the desired information; and with his money in his pocket, our hero took steamboat for Red River, resolving to find out and re-purchase his old friend.</p>
<p>He was soon introduced into the house, where he found Legree in the sitting-room.</p>
<p>Legree received the stranger with a kind of surly hospitality,</p>
<p>"I understand," said the young man, "that you bought, in New Orleans, a boy, named Tom. He used to be on my father's place, and I came to see if I couldn't buy him back."</p>
<p>Legree's brow grew dark, and he broke out, passionately: "Yes, I did buy such a fellow,&#8212;and a h&#8212;l of a bargain I had of it, too! The most rebellious, saucy, impudent dog! Set up my niggers to run away; got off two gals, worth eight hundred or a thousand apiece. He owned to that, and, when I bid him tell me where they was, he up and said he knew, but he wouldn't tell; and stood to it, though I gave him the cussedest flogging I ever gave nigger yet. I b'lieve he's trying to die; but I don't know as he'll make it out."</p>
<p>"Where is he?" said George, impetuously. "Let me see him." The cheeks of the young man were crimson, and his eyes flashed fire; but he prudently said nothing, as yet.</p>
<p>"He's in dat ar shed," said a little fellow, who stood holding George's horse.</p>
<p>Legree kicked the boy, and swore at him; but George, without saying another word, turned and strode to the spot.</p>
<p>Tom had been lying two days since the fatal night, not suffering, for every nerve of suffering was blunted and destroyed. He lay, for the most part, in a quiet stupor; for the laws of a powerful and well-knit frame would not at once release the imprisoned spirit. By stealth, there had been there, in the darkness of the night, poor desolated creatures, who stole from their scanty hours' rest, that they might repay to him some of those ministrations of love in which he had always been so abundant. Truly, those poor disciples had little to give,&#8212;only the cup of cold water; but it was given with full hearts.</p>
<p>Tears had fallen on that honest, insensible face,&#8212;tears of late repentance in the poor, ignorant heathen, whom his dying love and patience had awakened to repentance, and bitter prayers, breathed over him to a late-found Saviour, of whom they scarce knew more than the name, but whom the yearning ignorant heart of man never implores in vain.</p>
<p>Cassy, who had glided out of her place of concealment, and, by overhearing, learned the sacrifice that had been made for her and Emmeline, had been there, the night before, defying the danger of detection; and, moved by the last few words which the affectionate soul had yet strength to breathe, the long winter of despair, the ice of years, had given way, and the dark, despairing woman had wept and prayed.</p>
<p>When George entered the shed, he felt his head giddy and his heart sick.</p>
<p>"Is it possible,&#8212;is it possible?" said he, kneeling down by him. "Uncle Tom, my poor, poor old friend!"</p>
<p>Something in the voice penetrated to the ear of the dying. He moved his head gently, smiled, and said,</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Jesus can make a dying-bed<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Feel soft as down pillows are."<br/>
</div>
<p>Tears which did honor to his manly heart fell from the young man's eyes, as he bent over his poor friend.</p>
<p>"O, dear Uncle Tom! do wake,&#8212;do speak once more! Look up! Here's Mas'r George,&#8212;your own little Mas'r George. Don't you know me?"</p>
<p>"Mas'r George!" said Tom, opening his eyes, and speaking in a feeble voice; "Mas'r George!" He looked bewildered.</p>
<p>Slowly the idea seemed to fill his soul; and the vacant eye became fixed and brightened, the whole face lighted up, the hard hands clasped, and tears ran down the cheeks.</p>
<p>"Bless the Lord! it is,&#8212;it is,&#8212;it's all I wanted! They haven't forgot me. It warms my soul; it does my heart good! Now I shall die content! Bless the Lord, on my soul!"</p>
<p>"You shan't die! you <i>mustn't</i> die, nor think of it! I've come to buy you, and take you home," said George, with impetuous vehemence.</p>
<p>"O, Mas'r George, ye're too late. The Lord's bought me, and is going to take me home,&#8212;and I long to go. Heaven is better than Kintuck."</p>
<p>"O, don't die! It'll kill me!&#8212;it'll break my heart to think what you've suffered,&#8212;and lying in this old shed, here! Poor, poor fellow!"</p>
<p>"Don't call me poor fellow!" said Tom, solemnly, "I <i>have</i> been poor fellow; but that's all past and gone, now. I'm right in the door, going into glory! O, Mas'r George! <i>Heaven has come!</i> I've got the victory!&#8212;the Lord Jesus has given it to me! Glory be to His name!"</p>
<p>George was awe-struck at the force, the vehemence, the power, with which these broken sentences were uttered. He sat gazing in silence.</p>
<p>Tom grasped his hand, and continued,&#8212;"Ye mustn't, now, tell Chloe, poor soul! how ye found me;&#8212;'t would be so drefful to her. Only tell her ye found me going into glory; and that I couldn't stay for no one. And tell her the Lord's stood by me everywhere and al'ays, and made everything light and easy. And oh, the poor chil'en, and the baby;&#8212;my old heart's been most broke for 'em, time and agin! Tell 'em all to follow me&#8212;follow me! Give my love to Mas'r, and dear good Missis, and everybody in the place! Ye don't know! 'Pears like I loves 'em all! I loves every creature everywhar!&#8212;it's nothing <i>but</i> love! O, Mas'r George! what a thing 't is to be a Christian!"</p>
<p>At this moment, Legree sauntered up to the door of the shed, looked in, with a dogged air of affected carelessness, and turned away.</p>
<p>"The old Satan!" said George, in his indignation. "It's a comfort to think the devil will pay <i>him</i> for this, some of these days!"</p>
<p>"O, don't!&#8212;oh, ye mustn't!" said Tom, grasping his hand; "he's a poor mis'able critter! it's awful to think on 't! Oh, if he only could repent, the Lord would forgive him now; but I'm 'feared he never will!"</p>
<p>"I hope he won't!" said George; "I never want to see <i>him</i> in heaven!"</p>
<p>"Hush, Mas'r George!&#8212;it worries me! Don't feel so! He an't done me no real harm,&#8212;only opened the gate of the kingdom for me; that's all!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the sudden flush of strength which the joy of meeting his young master had infused into the dying man gave way. A sudden sinking fell upon him; he closed his eyes; and that mysterious and sublime change passed over his face, that told the approach of other worlds.</p>
<p>He began to draw his breath with long, deep inspirations; and his broad chest rose and fell, heavily. The expression of his face was that of a conqueror.</p>
<p>"Who,&#8212;who,&#8212;who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" he said, in a voice that contended with mortal weakness; and, with a smile, he fell asleep.</p>
<p>George sat fixed with solemn awe. It seemed to him that the place was holy; and, as he closed the lifeless eyes, and rose up from the dead, only one thought possessed him,&#8212;that expressed by his simple old friend,&#8212;"What a thing it is to be a Christian!"</p>
<p>He turned: Legree was standing, sullenly, behind him.</p>
<p>Something in that dying scene had checked the natural fierceness of youthful passion. The presence of the man was simply loathsome to George; and he felt only an impulse to get away from him, with as few words as possible.</p>
<p>Fixing his keen dark eyes on Legree, he simply said, pointing to the dead, "You have got all you ever can of him. What shall I pay you for the body? I will take it away, and bury it decently."</p>
<p>"I don't sell dead niggers," said Legree, doggedly. "You are welcome to bury him where and when you like."</p>
<p>"Boys," said George, in an authoritative tone, to two or three negroes, who were looking at the body, "help me lift him up, and carry him to my wagon; and get me a spade."</p>
<p>One of them ran for a spade; the other two assisted George to carry the body to the wagon.</p>
<p>George neither spoke to nor looked at Legree, who did not countermand his orders, but stood, whistling, with an air of forced unconcern. He sulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door.</p>
<p>George spread his cloak in the wagon, and had the body carefully disposed of in it,&#8212;moving the seat, so as to give it room. Then he turned, fixed his eyes on Legree, and said, with forced composure,</p>
<p>"I have not, as yet, said to you what I think of this most atrocious affair;&#8212;this is not the time and place. But, sir, this innocent blood shall have justice. I will proclaim this murder. I will go to the very first magistrate, and expose you."</p>
<p>"Do!" said Legree, snapping his fingers, scornfully. "I'd like to see you doing it. Where you going to get witnesses?&#8212;how you going to prove it?&#8212;Come, now!"</p>
<p>George saw, at once, the force of this defiance. There was not a white person on the place; and, in all southern courts, the testimony of colored blood is nothing. He felt, at that moment, as if he could have rent the heavens with his heart's indignant cry for justice; but in vain.</p>
<p>"After all, what a fuss, for a dead nigger!" said Legree.</p>
<p>The word was as a spark to a powder magazine. Prudence was never a cardinal virtue of the Kentucky boy. George turned, and, with one indignant blow, knocked Legree flat upon his face; and, as he stood over him, blazing with wrath and defiance, he would have formed no bad personification of his great namesake triumphing over the dragon.</p>
<p>Some men, however, are decidedly bettered by being knocked down. If a man lays them fairly flat in the dust, they seem immediately to conceive a respect for him; and Legree was one of this sort. As he rose, therefore, and brushed the dust from his clothes, he eyed the slowly-retreating wagon with some evident consideration; nor did he open his mouth till it was out of sight.</p>
<p>Beyond the boundaries of the plantation, George had noticed a dry, sandy knoll, shaded by a few trees; there they made the grave.</p>
<p>"Shall we take off the cloak, Mas'r?" said the negroes, when the grave was ready.</p>
<p>"No, no,&#8212;bury it with him! It's all I can give you, now, poor Tom, and you shall have it."</p>
<p>They laid him in; and the men shovelled away, silently. They banked it up, and laid green turf over it.</p>
<p>"You may go, boys," said George, slipping a quarter into the hand of each. They lingered about, however.</p>
<p>"If young Mas'r would please buy us&#8212;" said one.</p>
<p>"We'd serve him so faithful!" said the other.</p>
<p>"Hard times here, Mas'r!" said the first. "Do, Mas'r, buy us, please!"</p>
<p>"I can't!&#8212;I can't!" said George, with difficulty, motioning them off; "it's impossible!"</p>
<p>The poor fellows looked dejected, and walked off in silence.</p>
<p>"Witness, eternal God!" said George, kneeling on the grave of his poor friend; "oh, witness, that, from this hour, I will do <i>what one man can</i> to drive out this curse of slavery from my land!"</p>
<p>There is no monument to mark the last resting-place of our friend. He needs none! His Lord knows where he lies, and will raise him up, immortal, to appear with him when he shall appear in his glory.</p>
<p>Pity him not! Such a life and death is not for pity! Not in the riches of omnipotence is the chief glory of God; but in self-denying, suffering love! And blessed are the men whom he calls to fellowship with him, bearing their cross after him with patience. Of such it is written, "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted."</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00085">CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00086">An Authentic Ghost Story</h6>
<p>For some remarkable reason, ghostly legends were uncommonly rife, about this time, among the servants on Legree's place.</p>
<p>It was whisperingly asserted that footsteps, in the dead of night, had been heard descending the garret stairs, and patrolling the house. In vain the doors of the upper entry had been locked; the ghost either carried a duplicate key in its pocket, or availed itself of a ghost's immemorial privilege of coming through the keyhole, and promenaded as before, with a freedom that was alarming.</p>
<p>Authorities were somewhat divided, as to the outward form of the spirit, owing to a custom quite prevalent among negroes,&#8212;and, for aught we know, among whites, too,&#8212;of invariably shutting the eyes, and covering up heads under blankets, petticoats, or whatever else might come in use for a shelter, on these occasions. Of course, as everybody knows, when the bodily eyes are thus out of the lists, the spiritual eyes are uncommonly vivacious and perspicuous; and, therefore, there were abundance of full-length portraits of the ghost, abundantly sworn and testified to, which, as is often the case with portraits, agreed with each other in no particular, except the common family peculiarity of the ghost tribe,&#8212;the wearing of a <i>white sheet</i>. The poor souls were not versed in ancient history, and did not know that Shakspeare had authenticated this costume, by telling how</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "The sheeted dead<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Did squeak and gibber in the streets of Rome."<a id="footref-29" href="uncle-toms-cabin-or-life-among-the-lowly-19.html#foot-29">[29]</a><br/>
</div>
<p>And, therefore, their all hitting upon this is a striking fact in pneumatology, which we recommend to the attention of spiritual media generally.</p>
<p>Be it as it may, we have private reasons for knowing that a tall figure in a white sheet did walk, at the most approved ghostly hours, around the Legree premises,&#8212;pass out the doors, glide about the house,&#8212;disappear at intervals, and, reappearing, pass up the silent stairway, into that fatal garret; and that, in the morning, the entry doors were all found shut and locked as firm as ever.</p>
<p>Legree could not help overhearing this whispering; and it was all the more exciting to him, from the pains that were taken to conceal it from him. He drank more brandy than usual; held up his head briskly, and swore louder than ever in the daytime; but he had bad dreams, and the visions of his head on his bed were anything but agreeable. The night after Tom's body had been carried away, he rode to the next town for a carouse, and had a high one. Got home late and tired; locked his door, took out the key, and went to bed.</p>
<p>After all, let a man take what pains he may to hush it down, a human soul is an awful ghostly, unquiet possession, for a bad man to have. Who knows the metes and bounds of it? Who knows all its awful perhapses,&#8212;those shudderings and tremblings, which it can no more live down than it can outlive its own eternity! What a fool is he who locks his door to keep out spirits, who has in his own bosom a spirit he dares not meet alone,&#8212;whose voice, smothered far down, and piled over with mountains of earthliness, is yet like the forewarning trumpet of doom!</p>
<p>But Legree locked his door and set a chair against it; he set a night-lamp at the head of his bed; and put his pistols there. He examined the catches and fastenings of the windows, and then swore he "didn't care for the devil and all his angels," and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Well, he slept, for he was tired,&#8212;slept soundly. But, finally, there came over his sleep a shadow, a horror, an apprehension of something dreadful hanging over him. It was his mother's shroud, he thought; but Cassy had it, holding it up, and showing it to him. He heard a confused noise of screams and groanings; and, with it all, he knew he was asleep, and he struggled to wake himself. He was half awake. He was sure something was coming into his room. He knew the door was opening, but he could not stir hand or foot. At last he turned, with a start; the door <i>was</i> open, and he saw a hand putting out his light.</p>
<p>It was a cloudy, misty moonlight, and there he saw it!&#8212;something white, gliding in! He heard the still rustle of its ghostly garments. It stood still by his bed;&#8212;a cold hand touched his; a voice said, three times, in a low, fearful whisper, "Come! come! come!" And, while he lay sweating with terror, he knew not when or how, the thing was gone. He sprang out of bed, and pulled at the door. It was shut and locked, and the man fell down in a swoon.</p>
<p>After this, Legree became a harder drinker than ever before. He no longer drank cautiously, prudently, but imprudently and recklessly.</p>
<p>There were reports around the country, soon after that he was sick and dying. Excess had brought on that frightful disease that seems to throw the lurid shadows of a coming retribution back into the present life. None could bear the horrors of that sick room, when he raved and screamed, and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those who heard him; and, at his dying bed, stood a stern, white, inexorable figure, saying, "Come! come! come!"</p>
<p>By a singular coincidence, on the very night that this vision appeared to Legree, the house-door was found open in the morning, and some of the negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards the high-road.</p>
<p>It was near sunrise when Cassy and Emmeline paused, for a moment, in a little knot of trees near the town.</p>
<p>Cassy was dressed after the manner of the Creole Spanish ladies,&#8212;wholly in black. A small black bonnet on her head, covered by a veil thick with embroidery, concealed her face. It had been agreed that, in their escape, she was to personate the character of a Creole lady, and Emmeline that of her servant.</p>
<p>Brought up, from early life, in connection with the highest society, the language, movements and air of Cassy, were all in agreement with this idea; and she had still enough remaining with her, of a once splendid wardrobe, and sets of jewels, to enable her to personate the thing to advantage.</p>
<p>She stopped in the outskirts of the town, where she had noticed trunks for sale, and purchased a handsome one. This she requested the man to send along with her. And, accordingly, thus escorted by a boy wheeling her trunk, and Emmeline behind her, carrying her carpet-bag and sundry bundles, she made her appearance at the small tavern, like a lady of consideration.</p>
<p>The first person that struck her, after her arrival, was George Shelby, who was staying there, awaiting the next boat.</p>
<p>Cassy had remarked the young man from her loophole in the garret, and seen him bear away the body of Tom, and observed with secret exultation, his rencontre with Legree. Subsequently she had gathered, from the conversations she had overheard among the negroes, as she glided about in her ghostly disguise, after nightfall, who he was, and in what relation he stood to Tom. She, therefore, felt an immediate accession of confidence, when she found that he was, like herself, awaiting the next boat.</p>
<p>Cassy's air and manner, address, and evident command of money, prevented any rising disposition to suspicion in the hotel. People never inquire too closely into those who are fair on the main point, of paying well,&#8212;a thing which Cassy had foreseen when she provided herself with money.</p>
<p>In the edge of the evening, a boat was heard coming along, and George Shelby handed Cassy aboard, with the politeness which comes naturally to every Kentuckian, and exerted himself to provide her with a good state-room.</p>
<p>Cassy kept her room and bed, on pretext of illness, during the whole time they were on Red River; and was waited on, with obsequious devotion, by her attendant.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Mississippi river, George, having learned that the course of the strange lady was upward, like his own, proposed to take a state-room for her on the same boat with himself,&#8212;good-naturedly compassionating her feeble health, and desirous to do what he could to assist her.</p>
<p>Behold, therefore, the whole party safely transferred to the good steamer Cincinnati, and sweeping up the river under a powerful head of steam.</p>
<p>Cassy's health was much better. She sat upon the guards, came to the table, and was remarked upon in the boat as a lady that must have been very handsome.</p>
<p>From the moment that George got the first glimpse of her face, he was troubled with one of those fleeting and indefinite likenesses, which almost every body can remember, and has been, at times, perplexed with. He could not keep himself from looking at her, and watching her perpetually. At table, or sitting at her state-room door, still she would encounter the young man's eyes fixed on her, and politely withdrawn, when she showed, by her countenance, that she was sensible to the observation.</p>
<p>Cassy became uneasy. She began to think that he suspected something; and finally resolved to throw herself entirely on his generosity, and intrusted him with her whole history.</p>
<p>George was heartily disposed to sympathize with any one who had escaped from Legree's plantation,&#8212;a place that he could not remember or speak of with patience,&#8212;and, with the courageous disregard of consequences which is characteristic of his age and state, he assured her that he would do all in his power to protect and bring them through.</p>
<p>The next state-room to Cassy's was occupied by a French lady, named De Thoux, who was accompanied by a fine little daughter, a child of some twelve summers.</p>
<p>This lady, having gathered, from George's conversation, that he was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight's trip on a steamboat.</p>
<p>George's chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation.</p>
<p>Madame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him.</p>
<p>"Do you know," said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, "of any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?"</p>
<p>"There is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father's place," said George. "We never have had much intercourse with him, though."</p>
<p>"He is a large slave-owner, I believe," said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show.</p>
<p>"He is," said George, looking rather surprised at her manner.</p>
<p>"Did you ever know of his having&#8212;perhaps, you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy, named George?"</p>
<p>"O, certainly,&#8212;George Harris,&#8212;I know him well; he married a servant of my mother's, but has escaped, now, to Canada."</p>
<p>"He has?" said Madame de Thoux, quickly. "Thank God!"</p>
<p>George looked a surprised inquiry, but said nothing.</p>
<p>Madame de Thoux leaned her head on her hand, and burst into tears.</p>
<p>"He is my brother," she said.</p>
<p>"Madame!" said George, with a strong accent of surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Madame de Thoux, lifting her head, proudly, and wiping her tears, "Mr. Shelby, George Harris is my brother!"</p>
<p>"I am perfectly astonished," said George, pushing back his chair a pace or two, and looking at Madame de Thoux.</p>
<p>"I was sold to the South when he was a boy," said she. "I was bought by a good and generous man. He took me with him to the West Indies, set me free, and married me. It is but lately that he died; and I was going up to Kentucky, to see if I could find and redeem my brother."</p>
<p>"I heard him speak of a sister Emily, that was sold South," said George.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed! I am the one," said Madame de Thoux;&#8212;"tell me what sort of a&#8212;"</p>
<p>"A very fine young man," said George, "notwithstanding the curse of slavery that lay on him. He sustained a first rate character, both for intelligence and principle. I know, you see," he said; "because he married in our family."</p>
<p>"What sort of a girl?" said Madame de Thoux, eagerly.</p>
<p>"A treasure," said George; "a beautiful, intelligent, amiable girl. Very pious. My mother had brought her up, and trained her as carefully, almost, as a daughter. She could read and write, embroider and sew, beautifully; and was a beautiful singer."</p>
<p>"Was she born in your house?" said Madame de Thoux.</p>
<p>"No. Father bought her once, in one of his trips to New Orleans, and brought her up as a present to mother. She was about eight or nine years old, then. Father would never tell mother what he gave for her; but, the other day, in looking over his old papers, we came across the bill of sale. He paid an extravagant sum for her, to be sure. I suppose, on account of her extraordinary beauty."</p>
<p>George sat with his back to Cassy, and did not see the absorbed expression of her countenance, as he was giving these details.</p>
<p>At this point in the story, she touched his arm, and, with a face perfectly white with interest, said, "Do you know the names of the people he bought her of?"</p>
<p>"A man of the name of Simmons, I think, was the principal in the transaction. At least, I think that was the name on the bill of sale."</p>
<p>"O, my God!" said Cassy, and fell insensible on the floor of the cabin.</p>
<p>George was wide awake now, and so was Madame de Thoux. Though neither of them could conjecture what was the cause of Cassy's fainting, still they made all the tumult which is proper in such cases;&#8212;George upsetting a wash-pitcher, and breaking two tumblers, in the warmth of his humanity; and various ladies in the cabin, hearing that somebody had fainted, crowded the state-room door, and kept out all the air they possibly could, so that, on the whole, everything was done that could be expected.</p>
<p>Poor Cassy! when she recovered, turned her face to the wall, and wept and sobbed like a child,&#8212;perhaps, mother, you can tell what she was thinking of! Perhaps you cannot,&#8212;but she felt as sure, in that hour, that God had had mercy on her, and that she should see her daughter,&#8212;as she did, months afterwards,&#8212;when&#8212;but we anticipate.</p>

<h6 id="dlepubid00088">Results</h6>
<p>The rest of our story is soon told. George Shelby, interested, as any other young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than by feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to Cassy the bill of sale of Eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her own knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity of her child. It remained now only for her to trace out the path of the fugitives.</p>
<p>Madame de Thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular coincidence of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to Canada, and began a tour of inquiry among the stations, where the numerous fugitives from slavery are located. At Amherstberg they found the missionary with whom George and Eliza had taken shelter, on their first arrival in Canada; and through him were enabled to trace the family to Montreal.</p>
<p>George and Eliza had now been five years free. George had found constant occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist, where he had been earning a competent support for his family, which, in the mean time, had been increased by the addition of another daughter.</p>
<p>Little Harry&#8212;a fine bright boy&#8212;had been put to a good school, and was making rapid proficiency in knowledge.</p>
<p>The worthy pastor of the station, in Amherstberg, where George had first landed, was so much interested in the statements of Madame de Thoux and Cassy, that he yielded to the solicitations of the former, to accompany them to Montreal, in their search,&#8212;she bearing all the expense of the expedition.</p>
<p>The scene now changes to a small, neat tenement, in the outskirts of Montreal; the time, evening. A cheerful fire blazes on the hearth; a tea-table, covered with a snowy cloth, stands prepared for the evening meal. In one corner of the room was a table covered with a green cloth, where was an open writing-desk, pens, paper, and over it a shelf of well-selected books.</p>
<p>This was George's study. The same zeal for self-improvement, which led him to steal the much coveted arts of reading and writing, amid all the toil and discouragements of his early life, still led him to devote all his leisure time to self-cultivation.</p>
<p>At this present time, he is seated at the table, making notes from a volume of the family library he has been reading.</p>
<p>"Come, George," says Eliza, "you've been gone all day. Do put down that book, and let's talk, while I'm getting tea,&#8212;do."</p>
<p>And little Eliza seconds the effort, by toddling up to her father, and trying to pull the book out of his hand, and install herself on his knee as a substitute.</p>
<p>"O, you little witch!" says George, yielding, as, in such circumstances, man always must.</p>
<p>"That's right," says Eliza, as she begins to cut a loaf of bread. A little older she looks; her form a little fuller; her air more matronly than of yore; but evidently contented and happy as woman need be.</p>
<p>"Harry, my boy, how did you come on in that sum, today?" says George, as he laid his hand on his son's head.</p>
<p>Harry has lost his long curls; but he can never lose those eyes and eyelashes, and that fine, bold brow, that flushes with triumph, as he answers, "I did it, every bit of it, <i>myself</i>, father; and <i>nobody</i> helped me!"</p>
<p>"That's right," says his father; "depend on yourself, my son. You have a better chance than ever your poor father had."</p>
<p>At this moment, there is a rap at the door; and Eliza goes and opens it. The delighted&#8212;"Why! this you?"&#8212;calls up her husband; and the good pastor of Amherstberg is welcomed. There are two more women with him, and Eliza asks them to sit down.</p>
<p>Now, if the truth must be told, the honest pastor had arranged a little programme, according to which this affair was to develop itself; and, on the way up, all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each other not to let things out, except according to previous arrangement.</p>
<p>What was the good man's consternation, therefore, just as he had motioned to the ladies to be seated, and was taking out his pocket-handkerchief to wipe his mouth, so as to proceed to his introductory speech in good order, when Madame de Thoux upset the whole plan, by throwing her arms around George's neck, and letting all out at once, by saying, "O, George! don't you know me? I'm your sister Emily."</p>
<p>Cassy had seated herself more composedly, and would have carried on her part very well, had not little Eliza suddenly appeared before her in exact shape and form, every outline and curl, just as her daughter was when she saw her last. The little thing peered up in her face; and Cassy caught her up in her arms, pressed her to her bosom, saying, what, at the moment she really believed, "Darling, I'm your mother!"</p>
<p>In fact, it was a troublesome matter to do up exactly in proper order; but the good pastor, at last, succeeded in getting everybody quiet, and delivering the speech with which he had intended to open the exercises; and in which, at last, he succeeded so well, that his whole audience were sobbing about him in a manner that ought to satisfy any orator, ancient or modern.</p>
<p>They knelt together, and the good man prayed,&#8212;for there are some feelings so agitated and tumultuous, that they can find rest only by being poured into the bosom of Almighty love,&#8212;and then, rising up, the new-found family embraced each other, with a holy trust in Him, who from such peril and dangers, and by such unknown ways, had brought them together.</p>
<p>The note-book of a missionary, among the Canadian fugitives, contains truth stranger than fiction. How can it be otherwise, when a system prevails which whirls families and scatters their members, as the wind whirls and scatters the leaves of autumn? These shores of refuge, like the eternal shore, often unite again, in glad communion, hearts that for long years have mourned each other as lost. And affecting beyond expression is the earnestness with which every new arrival among them is met, if, perchance, it may bring tidings of mother, sister, child or wife, still lost to view in the shadows of slavery.</p>
<p>Deeds of heroism are wrought here more than those of romance, when defying torture, and braving death itself, the fugitive voluntarily threads his way back to the terrors and perils of that dark land, that he may bring out his sister, or mother, or wife.</p>
<p>One young man, of whom a missionary has told us, twice re-captured, and suffering shameful stripes for his heroism, had escaped again; and, in a letter which we heard read, tells his friends that he is going back a third time, that he may, at last, bring away his sister. My good sir, is this man a hero, or a criminal? Would not you do as much for your sister? And can you blame him?</p>
<p>But, to return to our friends, whom we left wiping their eyes, and recovering themselves from too great and sudden a joy. They are now seated around the social board, and are getting decidedly companionable; only that Cassy, who keeps little Eliza on her lap, occasionally squeezes the little thing, in a manner that rather astonishes her, and obstinately refuses to have her mouth stuffed with cake to the extent the little one desires,&#8212;alleging, what the child rather wonders at, that she has got something better than cake, and doesn't want it.</p>
<p>And, indeed, in two or three days, such a change has passed over Cassy, that our readers would scarcely know her. The despairing, haggard expression of her face had given way to one of gentle trust. She seemed to sink, at once, into the bosom of the family, and take the little ones into her heart, as something for which it long had waited. Indeed, her love seemed to flow more naturally to the little Eliza than to her own daughter; for she was the exact image and body of the child whom she had lost. The little one was a flowery bond between mother and daughter, through whom grew up acquaintanceship and affection. Eliza's steady, consistent piety, regulated by the constant reading of the sacred word, made her a proper guide for the shattered and wearied mind of her mother. Cassy yielded at once, and with her whole soul, to every good influence, and became a devout and tender Christian.</p>
<p>After a day or two, Madame de Thoux told her brother more particularly of her affairs. The death of her husband had left her an ample fortune, which she generously offered to share with the family. When she asked George what way she could best apply it for him, he answered, "Give me an education, Emily; that has always been my heart's desire. Then, I can do all the rest."</p>
<p>On mature deliberation, it was decided that the whole family should go, for some years, to France; whither they sailed, carrying Emmeline with them.</p>
<p>The good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the vessel; and, shortly after entering the port, she became his wife.</p>
<p>George remained four years at a French university, and, applying himself with an unintermitted zeal, obtained a very thorough education.</p>
<p>Political troubles in France, at last, led the family again to seek an asylum in this country.</p>
<p>George's feelings and views, as an educated man, may be best expressed in a letter to one of his friends.</p>
<p>"I feel somewhat at a loss, as to my future course. True, as you have said to me, I might mingle in the circles of the whites, in this country, my shade of color is so slight, and that of my wife and family scarce perceptible. Well, perhaps, on sufferance, I might. But, to tell you the truth, I have no wish to.</p>
<p>"My sympathies are not for my father's race, but for my mother's. To him I was no more than a fine dog or horse: to my poor heart-broken mother I was a <i>child</i>; and, though I never saw her, after the cruel sale that separated us, till she died, yet I <i>know</i> she always loved me dearly. I know it by my own heart. When I think of all she suffered, of my own early sufferings, of the distresses and struggles of my heroic wife, of my sister, sold in the New Orleans slave-market,&#8212;though I hope to have no unchristian sentiments, yet I may be excused for saying, I have no wish to pass for an American, or to identify myself with them.</p>
<p>"It is with the oppressed, enslaved African race that I cast in my lot; and, if I wished anything, I would wish myself two shades darker, rather than one lighter.</p>
<p>"The desire and yearning of my soul is for an African <i>nationality</i>. I want a people that shall have a tangible, separate existence of its own; and where am I to look for it? Not in Hayti; for in Hayti they had nothing to start with. A stream cannot rise above its fountain. The race that formed the character of the Haytiens was a worn-out, effeminate one; and, of course, the subject race will be centuries in rising to anything.</p>
<p>"Where, then, shall I look? On the shores of Africa I see a republic,&#8212;a republic formed of picked men, who, by energy and self-educating force, have, in many cases, individually, raised themselves above a condition of slavery. Having gone through a preparatory stage of feebleness, this republic has, at last, become an acknowledged nation on the face of the earth,&#8212;acknowledged by both France and England. There it is my wish to go, and find myself a people.</p>
<p>"I am aware, now, that I shall have you all against me; but, before you strike, hear me. During my stay in France, I have followed up, with intense interest, the history of my people in America. I have noted the struggle between abolitionist and colonizationist, and have received some impressions, as a distant spectator, which could never have occurred to me as a participator.</p>
<p>"I grant that this Liberia may have subserved all sorts of purposes, by being played off, in the hands of our oppressors, against us. Doubtless the scheme may have been used, in unjustifiable ways, as a means of retarding our emancipation. But the question to me is, Is there not a God above all man's schemes? May He not have over-ruled their designs, and founded for us a nation by them?</p>
<p>"In these days, a nation is born in a day. A nation starts, now, with all the great problems of republican life and civilization wrought out to its hand;&#8212;it has not to discover, but only to apply. Let us, then, all take hold together, with all our might, and see what we can do with this new enterprise, and the whole splendid continent of Africa opens before us and our children. <i>Our nation</i> shall roll the tide of civilization and Christianity along its shores, and plant there mighty republics, that, growing with the rapidity of tropical vegetation, shall be for all coming ages.</p>
<p>"Do you say that I am deserting my enslaved brethren? I think not. If I forget them one hour, one moment of my life, so may God forget me! But, what can I do for them, here? Can I break their chains? No, not as an individual; but, let me go and form part of a nation, which shall have a voice in the councils of nations, and then we can speak. A nation has a right to argue, remonstrate, implore, and present the cause of its race,&#8212;which an individual has not.</p>
<p>"If Europe ever becomes a grand council of free nations,&#8212;as I trust in God it will,&#8212;if, there, serfdom, and all unjust and oppressive social inequalities, are done away; and if they, as France and England have done, acknowledge our position,&#8212;then, in the great congress of nations, we will make our appeal, and present the cause of our enslaved and suffering race; and it cannot be that free, enlightened America will not then desire to wipe from her escutcheon that bar sinister which disgraces her among nations, and is as truly a curse to her as to the enslaved.</p>
<p>"But, you will tell me, our race have equal rights to mingle in the American republic as the Irishman, the German, the Swede. Granted, they have. We <i>ought</i> to be free to meet and mingle,&#8212;to rise by our individual worth, without any consideration of caste or color; and they who deny us this right are false to their own professed principles of human equality. We ought, in particular, to be allowed <i>here</i>. We have <i>more</i> than the rights of common men;&#8212;we have the claim of an injured race for reparation. But, then, <i>I do not want it</i>; I want a country, a nation, of my own. I think that the African race has peculiarities, yet to be unfolded in the light of civilization and Christianity, which, if not the same with those of the Anglo-Saxon, may prove to be, morally, of even a higher type.</p>
<p>"To the Anglo-Saxon race has been intrusted the destinies of the world, during its pioneer period of struggle and conflict. To that mission its stern, inflexible, energetic elements, were well adapted; but, as a Christian, I look for another era to arise. On its borders I trust we stand; and the throes that now convulse the nations are, to my hope, but the birth-pangs of an hour of universal peace and brotherhood.</p>
<p>"I trust that the development of Africa is to be essentially a Christian one. If not a dominant and commanding race, they are, at least, an affectionate, magnanimous, and forgiving one. Having been called in the furnace of injustice and oppression, they have need to bind closer to their hearts that sublime doctrine of love and forgiveness, through which alone they are to conquer, which it is to be their mission to spread over the continent of Africa.</p>
<p>"In myself, I confess, I am feeble for this,&#8212;full half the blood in my veins is the hot and hasty Saxon; but I have an eloquent preacher of the Gospel ever by my side, in the person of my beautiful wife. When I wander, her gentler spirit ever restores me, and keeps before my eyes the Christian calling and mission of our race. As a Christian patriot, as a teacher of Christianity, I go to <i>my country</i>,&#8212;my chosen, my glorious Africa!&#8212;and to her, in my heart, I sometimes apply those splendid words of prophecy: 'Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee; <i>I</i> will make thee an eternal excellence, a joy of many generations!'</p>
<p>"You will call me an enthusiast: you will tell me that I have not well considered what I am undertaking. But I have considered, and counted the cost. I go to <i>Liberia</i>, not as an Elysium of romance, but as to <i>a field of work</i>. I expect to work with both hands,&#8212;to work <i>hard</i>; to work against all sorts of difficulties and discouragements; and to work till I die. This is what I go for; and in this I am quite sure I shall not be disappointed.</p>
<p>"Whatever you may think of my determination, do not divorce me from your confidence; and think that, in whatever I do, I act with a heart wholly given to my people.</p>
<p>"GEORGE HARRIS."</p>
<p>George, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for Africa, some few weeks after. If we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear from him there.</p>
<p>Of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except a word relating to Miss Ophelia and Topsy, and a farewell chapter, which we shall dedicate to George Shelby.</p>
<p>Miss Ophelia took Topsy home to Vermont with her, much to the surprise of the grave deliberative body whom a New Englander recognizes under the term "<i>Our folks</i>." "Our folks," at first, thought it an odd and unnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but, so thoroughly efficient was Miss Ophelia in her conscientious endeavor to do her duty by her <i>lve</i>, that the child rapidly grew in grace and in favor with the family and neighborhood. At the age of womanhood, she was, by her own request, baptized, and became a member of the Christian church in the place; and showed so much intelligence, activity and zeal, and desire to do good in the world, that she was at last recommended, and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in Africa; and we have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which, when a child, made her so multiform and restless in her developments, is now employed, in a safer and wholesomer manner, in teaching the children of her own country.</p>
<p>P.S.&#8212;It will be a satisfaction to some mother, also, to state, that some inquiries, which were set on foot by Madame de Thoux, have resulted recently in the discovery of Cassy's son. Being a young man of energy, he had escaped, some years before his mother, and been received and educated by friends of the oppressed in the north. He will soon follow his family to Africa.</p>
