<h6 id="dlepubid00009">An Evening in Uncle Tom's Cabin</h6>
<p>The cabin of Uncle Tom was a small log building, close adjoining to "the house," as the negro <i>par excellence</i> designates his master's dwelling. In front it had a neat garden-patch, where, every summer, strawberries, raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, flourished under careful tending. The whole front of it was covered by a large scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose, which, entwisting and interlacing, left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen. Here, also, in summer, various brilliant annuals, such as marigolds, petunias, four-o'clocks, found an indulgent corner in which to unfold their splendors, and were the delight and pride of Aunt Chloe's heart.</p>
<p>Let us enter the dwelling. The evening meal at the house is over, and Aunt Chloe, who presided over its preparation as head cook, has left to inferior officers in the kitchen the business of clearing away and washing dishes, and come out into her own snug territories, to "get her ole man's supper"; therefore, doubt not that it is her you see by the fire, presiding with anxious interest over certain frizzling items in a stew-pan, and anon with grave consideration lifting the cover of a bake-kettle, from whence steam forth indubitable intimations of "something good." A round, black, shining face is hers, so glossy as to suggest the idea that she might have been washed over with white of eggs, like one of her own tea rusks. Her whole plump countenance beams with satisfaction and contentment from under her well-starched checked turban, bearing on it, however, if we must confess it, a little of that tinge of self-consciousness which becomes the first cook of the neighborhood, as Aunt Chloe was universally held and acknowledged to be.</p>
<p>A cook she certainly was, in the very bone and centre of her soul. Not a chicken or turkey or duck in the barn-yard but looked grave when they saw her approaching, and seemed evidently to be reflecting on their latter end; and certain it was that she was always meditating on trussing, stuffing and roasting, to a degree that was calculated to inspire terror in any reflecting fowl living. Her corn-cake, in all its varieties of hoe-cake, dodgers, muffins, and other species too numerous to mention, was a sublime mystery to all less practised compounders; and she would shake her fat sides with honest pride and merriment, as she would narrate the fruitless efforts that one and another of her compeers had made to attain to her elevation.</p>
<p>The arrival of company at the house, the arranging of dinners and suppers "in style," awoke all the energies of her soul; and no sight was more welcome to her than a pile of travelling trunks launched on the verandah, for then she foresaw fresh efforts and fresh triumphs.</p>
<p>Just at present, however, Aunt Chloe is looking into the bake-pan; in which congenial operation we shall leave her till we finish our picture of the cottage.</p>
<p>In one corner of it stood a bed, covered neatly with a snowy spread; and by the side of it was a piece of carpeting, of some considerable size. On this piece of carpeting Aunt Chloe took her stand, as being decidedly in the upper walks of life; and it and the bed by which it lay, and the whole corner, in fact, were treated with distinguished consideration, and made, so far as possible, sacred from the marauding inroads and desecrations of little folks. In fact, that corner was the <i>drawing-room</i> of the establishment. In the other corner was a bed of much humbler pretensions, and evidently designed for <i>use</i>. The wall over the fireplace was adorned with some very brilliant scriptural prints, and a portrait of General Washington, drawn and colored in a manner which would certainly have astonished that hero, if ever he happened to meet with its like.</p>
<p>On a rough bench in the corner, a couple of woolly-headed boys, with glistening black eyes and fat shining cheeks, were busy in superintending the first walking operations of the baby, which, as is usually the case, consisted in getting up on its feet, balancing a moment, and then tumbling down,&#8212;each successive failure being violently cheered, as something decidedly clever.</p>
<p>A table, somewhat rheumatic in its limbs, was drawn out in front of the fire, and covered with a cloth, displaying cups and saucers of a decidedly brilliant pattern, with other symptoms of an approaching meal. At this table was seated Uncle Tom, Mr. Shelby's best hand, who, as he is to be the hero of our story, we must daguerreotype for our readers. He was a large, broad-chested, powerfully-made man, of a full glossy black, and a face whose truly African features were characterized by an expression of grave and steady good sense, united with much kindliness and benevolence. There was something about his whole air self-respecting and dignified, yet united with a confiding and humble simplicity.</p>
<p>He was very busily intent at this moment on a slate lying before him, on which he was carefully and slowly endeavoring to accomplish a copy of some letters, in which operation he was overlooked by young Mas'r George, a smart, bright boy of thirteen, who appeared fully to realize the dignity of his position as instructor.</p>
<p>"Not that way, Uncle Tom,&#8212;not that way," said he, briskly, as Uncle Tom laboriously brought up the tail of his <i>g</i> the wrong side out; "that makes a <i>q</i>, you see."</p>
<p>"La sakes, now, does it?" said Uncle Tom, looking with a respectful, admiring air, as his young teacher flourishingly scrawled <i>q</i>'s and <i>g</i>'s innumerable for his edification; and then, taking the pencil in his big, heavy fingers, he patiently recommenced.</p>
<p>"How easy white folks al'us does things!" said Aunt Chloe, pausing while she was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her fork, and regarding young Master George with pride. "The way he can write, now! and read, too! and then to come out here evenings and read his lessons to us,&#8212;it's mighty interestin'!"</p>
<p>"But, Aunt Chloe, I'm getting mighty hungry," said George. "Isn't that cake in the skillet almost done?"</p>
<p>"Mose done, Mas'r George," said Aunt Chloe, lifting the lid and peeping in,&#8212;"browning beautiful&#8212;a real lovely brown. Ah! let me alone for dat. Missis let Sally try to make some cake, t' other day, jes to <i>larn</i> her, she said. 'O, go way, Missis,' said I; 'it really hurts my feelin's, now, to see good vittles spilt dat ar way! Cake ris all to one side&#8212;no shape at all; no more than my shoe; go way!"</p>
<p>And with this final expression of contempt for Sally's greenness, Aunt Chloe whipped the cover off the bake-kettle, and disclosed to view a neatly-baked pound-cake, of which no city confectioner need to have been ashamed. This being evidently the central point of the entertainment, Aunt Chloe began now to bustle about earnestly in the supper department.</p>
<p>"Here you, Mose and Pete! get out de way, you niggers! Get away, Polly, honey,&#8212;mammy'll give her baby some fin, by and by. Now, Mas'r George, you jest take off dem books, and set down now with my old man, and I'll take up de sausages, and have de first griddle full of cakes on your plates in less dan no time."</p>
<p>"They wanted me to come to supper in the house," said George; "but I knew what was what too well for that, Aunt Chloe."</p>
<p>"So you did&#8212;so you did, honey," said Aunt Chloe, heaping the smoking batter-cakes on his plate; "you know'd your old aunty'd keep the best for you. O, let you alone for dat! Go way!" And, with that, aunty gave George a nudge with her finger, designed to be immensely facetious, and turned again to her griddle with great briskness.</p>
<p>"Now for the cake," said Mas'r George, when the activity of the griddle department had somewhat subsided; and, with that, the youngster flourished a large knife over the article in question.</p>
<p>"La bless you, Mas'r George!" said Aunt Chloe, with earnestness, catching his arm, "you wouldn't be for cuttin' it wid dat ar great heavy knife! Smash all down&#8212;spile all de pretty rise of it. Here, I've got a thin old knife, I keeps sharp a purpose. Dar now, see! comes apart light as a feather! Now eat away&#8212;you won't get anything to beat dat ar."</p>
<p>"Tom Lincon says," said George, speaking with his mouth full, "that their Jinny is a better cook than you."</p>
<p>"Dem Lincons an't much count, no way!" said Aunt Chloe, contemptuously; "I mean, set along side <i>our</i> folks. They 's 'spectable folks enough in a kinder plain way; but, as to gettin' up anything in style, they don't begin to have a notion on 't. Set Mas'r Lincon, now, alongside Mas'r Shelby! Good Lor! and Missis Lincon,&#8212;can she kinder sweep it into a room like my missis,&#8212;so kinder splendid, yer know! O, go way! don't tell me nothin' of dem Lincons!"&#8212;and Aunt Chloe tossed her head as one who hoped she did know something of the world.</p>
<p>"Well, though, I've heard you say," said George, "that Jinny was a pretty fair cook."</p>
<p>"So I did," said Aunt Chloe,&#8212;"I may say dat. Good, plain, common cookin', Jinny'll do;&#8212;make a good pone o' bread,&#8212;bile her taters <i>far</i>,&#8212;her corn cakes isn't extra, not extra now, Jinny's corn cakes isn't, but then they's far,&#8212;but, Lor, come to de higher branches, and what <i>can</i> she do? Why, she makes pies&#8212;sartin she does; but what kinder crust? Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff? Now, I went over thar when Miss Mary was gwine to be married, and Jinny she jest showed me de weddin' pies. Jinny and I is good friends, ye know. I never said nothin'; but go 'long, Mas'r George! Why, I shouldn't sleep a wink for a week, if I had a batch of pies like dem ar. Why, dey wan't no 'count 't all."</p>
<p>"I suppose Jinny thought they were ever so nice," said George.</p>
<p>"Thought so!&#8212;didn't she? Thar she was, showing em, as innocent&#8212;ye see, it's jest here, Jinny <i>don't know</i>. Lor, the family an't nothing! She can't be spected to know! 'Ta'nt no fault o' hem. Ah, Mas'r George, you doesn't know half 'your privileges in yer family and bringin' up!" Here Aunt Chloe sighed, and rolled up her eyes with emotion.</p>
<p>"I'm sure, Aunt Chloe, I understand my pie and pudding privileges," said George. "Ask Tom Lincon if I don't crow over him, every time I meet him."</p>
<p>Aunt Chloe sat back in her chair, and indulged in a hearty guffaw of laughter, at this witticism of young Mas'r's, laughing till the tears rolled down her black, shining cheeks, and varying the exercise with playfully slapping and poking Mas'r Georgey, and telling him to go way, and that he was a case&#8212;that he was fit to kill her, and that he sartin would kill her, one of these days; and, between each of these sanguinary predictions, going off into a laugh, each longer and stronger than the other, till George really began to think that he was a very dangerously witty fellow, and that it became him to be careful how he talked "as funny as he could."</p>
<p>"And so ye telled Tom, did ye? O, Lor! what young uns will be up ter! Ye crowed over Tom? O, Lor! Mas'r George, if ye wouldn't make a hornbug laugh!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said George, "I says to him, 'Tom, you ought to see some of Aunt Chloe's pies; they're the right sort,' says I."</p>
<p>"Pity, now, Tom couldn't," said Aunt Chloe, on whose benevolent heart the idea of Tom's benighted condition seemed to make a strong impression. "Ye oughter just ask him here to dinner, some o' these times, Mas'r George," she added; "it would look quite pretty of ye. Ye know, Mas'r George, ye oughtenter feel 'bove nobody, on 'count yer privileges, 'cause all our privileges is gi'n to us; we ought al'ays to 'member that," said Aunt Chloe, looking quite serious.</p>
<p>"Well, I mean to ask Tom here, some day next week," said George; "and you do your prettiest, Aunt Chloe, and we'll make him stare. Won't we make him eat so he won't get over it for a fortnight?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes&#8212;sartin," said Aunt Chloe, delighted; "you'll see. Lor! to think of some of our dinners! Yer mind dat ar great chicken pie I made when we guv de dinner to General Knox? I and Missis, we come pretty near quarrelling about dat ar crust. What does get into ladies sometimes, I don't know; but, sometimes, when a body has de heaviest kind o' 'sponsibility on 'em, as ye may say, and is all kinder <i>'seris'</i> and taken up, dey takes dat ar time to be hangin' round and kinder interferin'! Now, Missis, she wanted me to do dis way, and she wanted me to do dat way; and, finally, I got kinder sarcy, and, says I, 'Now, Missis, do jist look at dem beautiful white hands o' yourn with long fingers, and all a sparkling with rings, like my white lilies when de dew 's on 'em; and look at my great black stumpin hands. Now, don't ye think dat de Lord must have meant <i>me</i> to make de pie-crust, and you to stay in de parlor? Dar! I was jist so sarcy, Mas'r George."</p>
<p>"And what did mother say?" said George.</p>
<p>"Say?&#8212;why, she kinder larfed in her eyes&#8212;dem great handsome eyes o' hern; and, says she, 'Well, Aunt Chloe, I think you are about in the right on 't,' says she; and she went off in de parlor. She oughter cracked me over de head for bein' so sarcy; but dar's whar 't is&#8212;I can't do nothin' with ladies in de kitchen!"</p>
<p>"Well, you made out well with that dinner,&#8212;I remember everybody said so," said George.</p>
<p>"Didn't I? And wan't I behind de dinin'-room door dat bery day? and didn't I see de General pass his plate three times for some more dat bery pie?&#8212;and, says he, 'You must have an uncommon cook, Mrs. Shelby.' Lor! I was fit to split myself.</p>
<p>"And de Gineral, he knows what cookin' is," said Aunt Chloe, drawing herself up with an air. "Bery nice man, de Gineral! He comes of one of de bery <i>fustest</i> families in Old Virginny! He knows what's what, now, as well as I do&#8212;de Gineral. Ye see, there's <i>pints</i> in all pies, Mas'r George; but tan't everybody knows what they is, or as orter be. But the Gineral, he knows; I knew by his 'marks he made. Yes, he knows what de pints is!"</p>
<p>By this time, Master George had arrived at that pass to which even a boy can come (under uncommon circumstances, when he really could not eat another morsel), and, therefore, he was at leisure to notice the pile of woolly heads and glistening eyes which were regarding their operations hungrily from the opposite corner.</p>
<p>"Here, you Mose, Pete," he said, breaking off liberal bits, and throwing it at them; "you want some, don't you? Come, Aunt Chloe, bake them some cakes."</p>
<p>And George and Tom moved to a comfortable seat in the chimney-corner, while Aunte Chloe, after baking a goodly pile of cakes, took her baby on her lap, and began alternately filling its mouth and her own, and distributing to Mose and Pete, who seemed rather to prefer eating theirs as they rolled about on the floor under the table, tickling each other, and occasionally pulling the baby's toes.</p>
<p>"O! go long, will ye?" said the mother, giving now and then a kick, in a kind of general way, under the table, when the movement became too obstreperous. "Can't ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye? Stop dat ar, now, will ye? Better mind yerselves, or I'll take ye down a button-hole lower, when Mas'r George is gone!"</p>
<p>What meaning was couched under this terrible threat, it is difficult to say; but certain it is that its awful indistinctness seemed to produce very little impression on the young sinners addressed.</p>
<p>"La, now!" said Uncle Tom, "they are so full of tickle all the while, they can't behave theirselves."</p>
<p>Here the boys emerged from under the table, and, with hands and faces well plastered with molasses, began a vigorous kissing of the baby.</p>
<p>"Get along wid ye!" said the mother, pushing away their woolly heads. "Ye'll all stick together, and never get clar, if ye do dat fashion. Go long to de spring and wash yerselves!" she said, seconding her exhortations by a slap, which resounded very formidably, but which seemed only to knock out so much more laugh from the young ones, as they tumbled precipitately over each other out of doors, where they fairly screamed with merriment.</p>
<p>"Did ye ever see such aggravating young uns?" said Aunt Chloe, rather complacently, as, producing an old towel, kept for such emergencies, she poured a little water out of the cracked tea-pot on it, and began rubbing off the molasses from the baby's face and hands; and, having polished her till she shone, she set her down in Tom's lap, while she busied herself in clearing away supper. The baby employed the intervals in pulling Tom's nose, scratching his face, and burying her fat hands in his woolly hair, which last operation seemed to afford her special content.</p>
<p>"Aint she a peart young un?" said Tom, holding her from him to take a full-length view; then, getting up, he set her on his broad shoulder, and began capering and dancing with her, while Mas'r George snapped at her with his pocket-handkerchief, and Mose and Pete, now returned again, roared after her like bears, till Aunt Chloe declared that they "fairly took her head off" with their noise. As, according to her own statement, this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in the cabin, the declaration no whit abated the merriment, till every one had roared and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of composure.</p>
<p>"Well, now, I hopes you're done," said Aunt Chloe, who had been busy in pulling out a rude box of a trundle-bed; "and now, you Mose and you Pete, get into thar; for we's goin' to have the meetin'."</p>
<p>"O mother, we don't wanter. We wants to sit up to meetin',&#8212;meetin's is so curis. We likes 'em."</p>
<p>"La, Aunt Chloe, shove it under, and let 'em sit up," said Mas'r George, decisively, giving a push to the rude machine.</p>
<p>Aunt Chloe, having thus saved appearances, seemed highly delighted to push the thing under, saying, as she did so, "Well, mebbe 't will do 'em some good."</p>
<p>The house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole, to consider the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting.</p>
<p>"What we's to do for cheers, now, <i>I</i> declar I don't know," said Aunt Chloe. As the meeting had been held at Uncle Tom's weekly, for an indefinite length of time, without any more "cheers," there seemed some encouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present.</p>
<p>"Old Uncle Peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer, last week," suggested Mose.</p>
<p>"You go long! I'll boun' you pulled 'em out; some o' your shines," said Aunt Chloe.</p>
<p>"Well, it'll stand, if it only keeps jam up agin de wall!" said Mose.</p>
<p>"Den Uncle Peter mus'n't sit in it, cause he al'ays hitches when he gets a singing. He hitched pretty nigh across de room, t' other night," said Pete.</p>
<p>"Good Lor! get him in it, then," said Mose, "and den he'd begin, 'Come saints&#8212;and sinners, hear me tell,' and den down he'd go,"&#8212;and Mose imitated precisely the nasal tones of the old man, tumbling on the floor, to illustrate the supposed catastrophe.</p>
<p>"Come now, be decent, can't ye?" said Aunt Chloe; "an't yer shamed?"</p>
<p>Mas'r George, however, joined the offender in the laugh, and declared decidedly that Mose was a "buster." So the maternal admonition seemed rather to fail of effect.</p>
<p>"Well, ole man," said Aunt Chloe, "you'll have to tote in them ar bar'ls."</p>
<p>"Mother's bar'ls is like dat ar widder's, Mas'r George was reading 'bout, in de good book,&#8212;dey never fails," said Mose, aside to Peter.</p>
<p>"I'm sure one on 'em caved in last week," said Pete, "and let 'em all down in de middle of de singin'; dat ar was failin', warnt it?"</p>
<p>During this aside between Mose and Pete, two empty casks had been rolled into the cabin, and being secured from rolling, by stones on each side, boards were laid across them, which arrangement, together with the turning down of certain tubs and pails, and the disposing of the rickety chairs, at last completed the preparation.</p>
<p>"Mas'r George is such a beautiful reader, now, I know he'll stay to read for us," said Aunt Chloe; "'pears like 't will be so much more interestin'."</p>
<p>George very readily consented, for your boy is always ready for anything that makes him of importance.</p>
<p>The room was soon filled with a motley assemblage, from the old gray-headed patriarch of eighty, to the young girl and lad of fifteen. A little harmless gossip ensued on various themes, such as where old Aunt Sally got her new red headkerchief, and how "Missis was a going to give Lizzy that spotted muslin gown, when she'd got her new berage made up;" and how Mas'r Shelby was thinking of buying a new sorrel colt, that was going to prove an addition to the glories of the place. A few of the worshippers belonged to families hard by, who had got permission to attend, and who brought in various choice scraps of information, about the sayings and doings at the house and on the place, which circulated as freely as the same sort of small change does in higher circles.</p>
<p>After a while the singing commenced, to the evident delight of all present. Not even all the disadvantage of nasal intonation could prevent the effect of the naturally fine voices, in airs at once wild and spirited. The words were sometimes the well-known and common hymns sung in the churches about, and sometimes of a wilder, more indefinite character, picked up at camp-meetings.</p>
<p>The chorus of one of them, which ran as follows, was sung with great energy and unction:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>"Die on the field of battle,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Die on the field of battle,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Glory in my soul."</i>
</div>
<p>Another special favorite had oft repeated the words&#8212;</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>"O, I'm going to glory,&#8212;won't you come along with me?<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Don't you see the angels beck'ning, and a calling me away?<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Don't you see the golden city and the everlasting day?"</i>
</div>
<p>There were others, which made incessant mention of "Jordan's banks," and "Canaan's fields," and the "New Jerusalem;" for the negro mind, impassioned and imaginative, always attaches itself to hymns and expressions of a vivid and pictorial nature; and, as they sung, some laughed, and some cried, and some clapped hands, or shook hands rejoicingly with each other, as if they had fairly gained the other side of the river.</p>
<p>Various exhortations, or relations of experience, followed, and intermingled with the singing. One old gray-headed woman, long past work, but much revered as a sort of chronicle of the past, rose, and leaning on her staff, said&#8212;"Well, chil'en! Well, I'm mighty glad to hear ye all and see ye all once more, 'cause I don't know when I'll be gone to glory; but I've done got ready, chil'en; 'pears like I'd got my little bundle all tied up, and my bonnet on, jest a waitin' for the stage to come along and take me home; sometimes, in the night, I think I hear the wheels a rattlin', and I'm lookin' out all the time; now, you jest be ready too, for I tell ye all, chil'en," she said striking her staff hard on the floor, "dat ar <i>glory</i> is a mighty thing! It's a mighty thing, chil'en,&#8212;you don'no nothing about it,&#8212;it's <i>wonderful</i>." And the old creature sat down, with streaming tears, as wholly overcome, while the whole circle struck up&#8212;</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>"O Canaan, bright Canaan<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I'm bound for the land of Canaan."</i>
</div>
<p>Mas'r George, by request, read the last chapters of Revelation, often interrupted by such exclamations as "The <i>sakes</i> now!" "Only hear that!" "Jest think on 't!" "Is all that a comin' sure enough?"</p>
<p>George, who was a bright boy, and well trained in religious things by his mother, finding himself an object of general admiration, threw in expositions of his own, from time to time, with a commendable seriousness and gravity, for which he was admired by the young and blessed by the old; and it was agreed, on all hands, that "a minister couldn't lay it off better than he did; that 't was reely 'mazin'!"</p>
<p>Uncle Tom was a sort of patriarch in religious matters, in the neighborhood. Having, naturally, an organization in which the <i>morale</i> was strongly predominant, together with a greater breadth and cultivation of mind than obtained among his companions, he was looked up to with great respect, as a sort of minister among them; and the simple, hearty, sincere style of his exhortations might have edified even better educated persons. But it was in prayer that he especially excelled. Nothing could exceed the touching simplicity, the childlike earnestness, of his prayer, enriched with the language of Scripture, which seemed so entirely to have wrought itself into his being, as to have become a part of himself, and to drop from his lips unconsciously; in the language of a pious old negro, he "prayed right up." And so much did his prayer always work on the devotional feelings of his audiences, that there seemed often a danger that it would be lost altogether in the abundance of the responses which broke out everywhere around him.</p>
<p>While this scene was passing in the cabin of the man, one quite otherwise passed in the halls of the master.</p>
<p>The trader and Mr. Shelby were seated together in the dining room afore-named, at a table covered with papers and writing utensils.</p>
<p>Mr. Shelby was busy in counting some bundles of bills, which, as they were counted, he pushed over to the trader, who counted them likewise.</p>
<p>"All fair," said the trader; "and now for signing these yer."</p>
<p>Mr. Shelby hastily drew the bills of sale towards him, and signed them, like a man that hurries over some disagreeable business, and then pushed them over with the money. Haley produced, from a well-worn valise, a parchment, which, after looking over it a moment, he handed to Mr. Shelby, who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness.</p>
<p>"Wal, now, the thing's <i>done</i>!" said the trader, getting up.</p>
<p>"It's <i>done</i>!" said Mr. Shelby, in a musing tone; and, fetching a long breath, he repeated, <i>"It's done!"</i></p>
<p>"Yer don't seem to feel much pleased with it, 'pears to me," said the trader.</p>
<p>"Haley," said Mr. Shelby, "I hope you'll remember that you promised, on your honor, you wouldn't sell Tom, without knowing what sort of hands he's going into."</p>
<p>"Why, you've just done it sir," said the trader.</p>
<p>"Circumstances, you well know, <i>obliged</i> me," said Shelby, haughtily.</p>
<p>"Wal, you know, they may 'blige <i>me</i>, too," said the trader. "Howsomever, I'll do the very best I can in gettin' Tom a good berth; as to my treatin' on him bad, you needn't be a grain afeard. If there's anything that I thank the Lord for, it is that I'm never noways cruel."</p>
<p>After the expositions which the trader had previously given of his humane principles, Mr. Shelby did not feel particularly reassured by these declarations; but, as they were the best comfort the case admitted of, he allowed the trader to depart in silence, and betook himself to a solitary cigar.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00010">CHAPTER V</h2>
<h6 id="dlepubid00011">Showing the Feelings of Living Property on Changing Owners</h6>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Shelby had retired to their apartment for the night. He was lounging in a large easy-chair, looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail, and she was standing before her mirror, brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had arranged her hair; for, noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes, she had excused her attendance that night, and ordered her to bed. The employment, naturally enough, suggested her conversation with the girl in the morning; and turning to her husband, she said, carelessly,</p>
<p>"By the by, Arthur, who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner-table today?"</p>
<p>"Haley is his name," said Shelby, turning himself rather uneasily in his chair, and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter.</p>
<p>"Haley! Who is he, and what may be his business here, pray?"</p>
<p>"Well, he's a man that I transacted some business with, last time I was at Natchez," said Mr. Shelby.</p>
<p>"And he presumed on it to make himself quite at home, and call and dine here, ay?"</p>
<p>"Why, I invited him; I had some accounts with him," said Shelby.</p>
<p>"Is he a negro-trader?" said Mrs. Shelby, noticing a certain embarrassment in her husband's manner.</p>
<p>"Why, my dear, what put that into your head?" said Shelby, looking up.</p>
<p>"Nothing,&#8212;only Eliza came in here, after dinner, in a great worry, crying and taking on, and said you were talking with a trader, and that she heard him make an offer for her boy&#8212;the ridiculous little goose!"</p>
<p>"She did, hey?" said Mr. Shelby, returning to his paper, which he seemed for a few moments quite intent upon, not perceiving that he was holding it bottom upwards.</p>
<p>"It will have to come out," said he, mentally; "as well now as ever."</p>
<p>"I told Eliza," said Mrs. Shelby, as she continued brushing her hair, "that she was a little fool for her pains, and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons. Of course, I knew you never meant to sell any of our people,&#8212;least of all, to such a fellow."</p>
<p>"Well, Emily," said her husband, "so I have always felt and said; but the fact is that my business lies so that I cannot get on without. I shall have to sell some of my hands."</p>
<p>"To that creature? Impossible! Mr. Shelby, you cannot be serious."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to say that I am," said Mr. Shelby. "I've agreed to sell Tom."</p>
<p>"What! our Tom?&#8212;that good, faithful creature!&#8212;been your faithful servant from a boy! O, Mr. Shelby!&#8212;and you have promised him his freedom, too,&#8212;you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well, I can believe anything now,&#8212;I can believe <i>now</i> that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza's only child!" said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation.</p>
<p>"Well, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don't know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day."</p>
<p>"But why, of all others, choose these?" said Mrs. Shelby. "Why sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?"</p>
<p>"Because they will bring the highest sum of any,&#8212;that's why. I could choose another, if you say so. The fellow made me a high bid on Eliza, if that would suit you any better," said Mr. Shelby.</p>
<p>"The wretch!" said Mrs. Shelby, vehemently.</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't listen to it, a moment,&#8212;out of regard to your feelings, I wouldn't;&#8212;so give me some credit."</p>
<p>"My dear," said Mrs. Shelby, recollecting herself, "forgive me. I have been hasty. I was surprised, and entirely unprepared for this;&#8212;but surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures. Tom is a noble-hearted, faithful fellow, if he is black. I do believe, Mr. Shelby, that if he were put to it, he would lay down his life for you."</p>
<p>"I know it,&#8212;I dare say;&#8212;but what's the use of all this?&#8212;I can't help myself."</p>
<p>"Why not make a pecuniary sacrifice? I'm willing to bear my part of the inconvenience. O, Mr. Shelby, I have tried&#8212;tried most faithfully, as a Christian woman should&#8212;to do my duty to these poor, simple, dependent creatures. I have cared for them, instructed them, watched over them, and know all their little cares and joys, for years; and how can I ever hold up my head again among them, if, for the sake of a little paltry gain, we sell such a faithful, excellent, confiding creature as poor Tom, and tear from him in a moment all we have taught him to love and value? I have taught them the duties of the family, of parent and child, and husband and wife; and how can I bear to have this open acknowledgment that we care for no tie, no duty, no relation, however sacred, compared with money? I have talked with Eliza about her boy&#8212;her duty to him as a Christian mother, to watch over him, pray for him, and bring him up in a Christian way; and now what can I say, if you tear him away, and sell him, soul and body, to a profane, unprincipled man, just to save a little money? I have told her that one soul is worth more than all the money in the world; and how will she believe me when she sees us turn round and sell her child?&#8212;sell him, perhaps, to certain ruin of body and soul!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry you feel so about it,&#8212;indeed I am," said Mr. Shelby; "and I respect your feelings, too, though I don't pretend to share them to their full extent; but I tell you now, solemnly, it's of no use&#8212;I can't help myself. I didn't mean to tell you this Emily; but, in plain words, there is no choice between selling these two and selling everything. Either they must go, or <i>all</i> must. Haley has come into possession of a mortgage, which, if I don't clear off with him directly, will take everything before it. I've raked, and scraped, and borrowed, and all but begged,&#8212;and the price of these two was needed to make up the balance, and I had to give them up. Haley fancied the child; he agreed to settle the matter that way, and no other. I was in his power, and <i>had</i> to do it. If you feel so to have them sold, would it be any better to have <i>all</i> sold?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Shelby stood like one stricken. Finally, turning to her toilet, she rested her face in her hands, and gave a sort of groan.</p>
<p>"This is God's curse on slavery!&#8212;a bitter, bitter, most accursed thing!&#8212;a curse to the master and a curse to the slave! I was a fool to think I could make anything good out of such a deadly evil. It is a sin to hold a slave under laws like ours,&#8212;I always felt it was,&#8212;I always thought so when I was a girl,&#8212;I thought so still more after I joined the church; but I thought I could gild it over,&#8212;I thought, by kindness, and care, and instruction, I could make the condition of mine better than freedom&#8212;fool that I was!"</p>
<p>"Why, wife, you are getting to be an abolitionist, quite."</p>
<p>"Abolitionist! if they knew all I know about slavery, they <i>might</i> talk! We don't need them to tell us; you know I never thought that slavery was right&#8212;never felt willing to own slaves."</p>
<p>"Well, therein you differ from many wise and pious men," said Mr. Shelby. "You remember Mr. B.'s sermon, the other Sunday?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to hear such sermons; I never wish to hear Mr. B. in our church again. Ministers can't help the evil, perhaps,&#8212;can't cure it, any more than we can,&#8212;but defend it!&#8212;it always went against my common sense. And I think you didn't think much of that sermon, either."</p>
<p>"Well," said Shelby, "I must say these ministers sometimes carry matters further than we poor sinners would exactly dare to do. We men of the world must wink pretty hard at various things, and get used to a deal that isn't the exact thing. But we don't quite fancy, when women and ministers come out broad and square, and go beyond us in matters of either modesty or morals, that's a fact. But now, my dear, I trust you see the necessity of the thing, and you see that I have done the very best that circumstances would allow."</p>
<p>"O yes, yes!" said Mrs. Shelby, hurriedly and abstractedly fingering her gold watch,&#8212;"I haven't any jewelry of any amount," she added, thoughtfully; "but would not this watch do something?&#8212;it was an expensive one, when it was bought. If I could only at least save Eliza's child, I would sacrifice anything I have."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, very sorry, Emily," said Mr. Shelby, "I'm sorry this takes hold of you so; but it will do no good. The fact is, Emily, the thing's done; the bills of sale are already signed, and in Haley's hands; and you must be thankful it is no worse. That man has had it in his power to ruin us all,&#8212;and now he is fairly off. If you knew the man as I do, you'd think that we had had a narrow escape."</p>
<p>"Is he so hard, then?"</p>
<p>"Why, not a cruel man, exactly, but a man of leather,&#8212;a man alive to nothing but trade and profit,&#8212;cool, and unhesitating, and unrelenting, as death and the grave. He'd sell his own mother at a good percentage&#8212;not wishing the old woman any harm, either."</p>
<p>"And this wretch owns that good, faithful Tom, and Eliza's child!"</p>
<p>"Well, my dear, the fact is that this goes rather hard with me; it's a thing I hate to think of. Haley wants to drive matters, and take possession tomorrow. I'm going to get out my horse bright and early, and be off. I can't see Tom, that's a fact; and you had better arrange a drive somewhere, and carry Eliza off. Let the thing be done when she is out of sight."</p>
<p>"No, no," said Mrs. Shelby; "I'll be in no sense accomplice or help in this cruel business. I'll go and see poor old Tom, God help him, in his distress! They shall see, at any rate, that their mistress can feel for and with them. As to Eliza, I dare not think about it. The Lord forgive us! What have we done, that this cruel necessity should come on us?"</p>
<p>There was one listener to this conversation whom Mr. and Mrs. Shelby little suspected.</p>
<p>Communicating with their apartment was a large closet, opening by a door into the outer passage. When Mrs. Shelby had dismissed Eliza for the night, her feverish and excited mind had suggested the idea of this closet; and she had hidden herself there, and, with her ear pressed close against the crack of the door, had lost not a word of the conversation.</p>
<p>When the voices died into silence, she rose and crept stealthily away. Pale, shivering, with rigid features and compressed lips, she looked an entirely altered being from the soft and timid creature she had been hitherto. She moved cautiously along the entry, paused one moment at her mistress' door, and raised her hands in mute appeal to Heaven, and then turned and glided into her own room. It was a quiet, neat apartment, on the same floor with her mistress. There was a pleasant sunny window, where she had often sat singing at her sewing; there a little case of books, and various little fancy articles, ranged by them, the gifts of Christmas holidays; there was her simple wardrobe in the closet and in the drawers:&#8212;here was, in short, her home; and, on the whole, a happy one it had been to her. But there, on the bed, lay her slumbering boy, his long curls falling negligently around his unconscious face, his rosy mouth half open, his little fat hands thrown out over the bedclothes, and a smile spread like a sunbeam over his whole face.</p>
<p>"Poor boy! poor fellow!" said Eliza; "they have sold you! but your mother will save you yet!"</p>
<p>No tear dropped over that pillow; in such straits as these, the heart has no tears to give,&#8212;it drops only blood, bleeding itself away in silence. She took a piece of paper and a pencil, and wrote, hastily,</p>
<p>"O, Missis! dear Missis! don't think me ungrateful,&#8212;don't think hard of me, any way,&#8212;I heard all you and master said tonight. I am going to try to save my boy&#8212;you will not blame me! God bless and reward you for all your kindness!"</p>
<p>Hastily folding and directing this, she went to a drawer and made up a little package of clothing for her boy, which she tied with a handkerchief firmly round her waist; and, so fond is a mother's remembrance, that, even in the terrors of that hour, she did not forget to put in the little package one or two of his favorite toys, reserving a gayly painted parrot to amuse him, when she should be called on to awaken him. It was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper; but, after some effort, he sat up, and was playing with his bird, while his mother was putting on her bonnet and shawl.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, mother?" said he, as she drew near the bed, with his little coat and cap.</p>
<p>His mother drew near, and looked so earnestly into his eyes, that he at once divined that something unusual was the matter.</p>
<p>"Hush, Harry," she said; "mustn't speak loud, or they will hear us. A wicked man was coming to take little Harry away from his mother, and carry him 'way off in the dark; but mother won't let him&#8212;she's going to put on her little boy's cap and coat, and run off with him, so the ugly man can't catch him."</p>
<p>Saying these words, she had tied and buttoned on the child's simple outfit, and, taking him in her arms, she whispered to him to be very still; and, opening a door in her room which led into the outer verandah, she glided noiselessly out.</p>
<p>It was a sparkling, frosty, starlight night, and the mother wrapped the shawl close round her child, as, perfectly quiet with vague terror, he clung round her neck.</p>
<p>Old Bruno, a great Newfoundland, who slept at the end of the porch, rose, with a low growl, as she came near. She gently spoke his name, and the animal, an old pet and playmate of hers, instantly, wagging his tail, prepared to follow her, though apparently revolving much, in this simple dog's head, what such an indiscreet midnight promenade might mean. Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom's cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane.</p>
<p>The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom's had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o'clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep.</p>
<p>"Good Lord! what's that?" said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. "My sakes alive, if it an't Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!&#8212;there's old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I'm gwine to open the door."</p>
<p>And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive.</p>
<p>"Lord bless you!&#8212;I'm skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what's come over ye?"</p>
<p>"I'm running away&#8212;Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe&#8212;carrying off my child&#8212;Master sold him!"</p>
<p>"Sold him?" echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay.</p>
<p>"Yes, sold him!" said Eliza, firmly; "I crept into the closet by Mistress' door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today."</p>
<p>Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream. Slowly and gradually, as its meaning came over him, he collapsed, rather than seated himself, on his old chair, and sunk his head down upon his knees.</p>
<p>"The good Lord have pity on us!" said Aunt Chloe. "O! it don't seem as if it was true! What has he done, that Mas'r should sell <i>him</i>?"</p>
<p>"He hasn't done anything,&#8212;it isn't for that. Master don't want to sell, and Missis she's always good. I heard her plead and beg for us; but he told her 't was no use; that he was in this man's debt, and that this man had got the power over him; and that if he didn't pay him off clear, it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people, and move off. Yes, I heard him say there was no choice between selling these two and selling all, the man was driving him so hard. Master said he was sorry; but oh, Missis&#8212;you ought to have heard her talk! If she an't a Christian and an angel, there never was one. I'm a wicked girl to leave her so; but, then, I can't help it. She said, herself, one soul was worth more than the world; and this boy has a soul, and if I let him be carried off, who knows what'll become of it? It must be right: but, if it an't right, the Lord forgive me, for I can't help doing it!"</p>
<p>"Well, old man!" said Aunt Chloe, "why don't you go, too? Will you wait to be toted down river, where they kill niggers with hard work and starving? I'd a heap rather die than go there, any day! There's time for ye,&#8212;be off with Lizy,&#8212;you've got a pass to come and go any time. Come, bustle up, and I'll get your things together."</p>
<p>Tom slowly raised his head, and looked sorrowfully but quietly around, and said,</p>
<p>"No, no&#8212;I an't going. Let Eliza go&#8212;it's her right! I wouldn't be the one to say no&#8212;'tan't in <i>natur</i> for her to stay; but you heard what she said! If I must be sold, or all the people on the place, and everything go to rack, why, let me be sold. I s'pose I can bar it as well as any on 'em," he added, while something like a sob and a sigh shook his broad, rough chest convulsively. "Mas'r always found me on the spot&#8212;he always will. I never have broke trust, nor used my pass no ways contrary to my word, and I never will. It's better for me alone to go, than to break up the place and sell all. Mas'r an't to blame, Chloe, and he'll take care of you and the poor&#8212;"</p>
<p>Here he turned to the rough trundle bed full of little woolly heads, and broke fairly down. He leaned over the back of the chair, and covered his face with his large hands. Sobs, heavy, hoarse and loud, shook the chair, and great tears fell through his fingers on the floor; just such tears, sir, as you dropped into the coffin where lay your first-born son; such tears, woman, as you shed when you heard the cries of your dying babe. For, sir, he was a man,&#8212;and you are but another man. And, woman, though dressed in silk and jewels, you are but a woman, and, in life's great straits and mighty griefs, ye feel but one sorrow!</p>
<p>"And now," said Eliza, as she stood in the door, "I saw my husband only this afternoon, and I little knew then what was to come. They have pushed him to the very last standing place, and he told me, today, that he was going to run away. Do try, if you can, to get word to him. Tell him how I went, and why I went; and tell him I'm going to try and find Canada. You must give my love to him, and tell him, if I never see him again," she turned away, and stood with her back to them for a moment, and then added, in a husky voice, "tell him to be as good as he can, and try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven."</p>
<p>"Call Bruno in there," she added. "Shut the door on him, poor beast! He mustn't go with me!"</p>
<p>A few last words and tears, a few simple adieus and blessings, and clasping her wondering and affrighted child in her arms, she glided noiselessly away.</p>
