<h2 id="id00412">CHAPTER 6</h2>

<h6 id="id00413">At Full Steam</h6>

<p id="id00414">AT THIS SHOUT the entire crew rushed toward the harpooner&#8212;
commander, officers, mates,</p>

<p id="id00415">sailors, cabin boys, down to engineers leaving their machinery
and stokers neglecting their furnaces.  The order was given to stop,
and the frigate merely coasted.</p>

<p id="id00416">By then the darkness was profound, and as good as the Canadian's
eyes were, I still wondered how he could see&#8212;and what he had seen.
My heart was pounding fit to burst.</p>

<p id="id00417">But Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all spotted the object his
hand was indicating.</p>

<p id="id00418">Two cable lengths off the Abraham Lincoln's starboard quarter,
the sea seemed to be lit up from underneath.  This was no
mere phosphorescent phenomenon, that much was unmistakable.
Submerged some fathoms below the surface of the water, the monster
gave off that very intense but inexplicable glow that several
captains had mentioned in their reports.  This magnificent radiance
had to come from some force with a great illuminating capacity.
The edge of its light swept over the sea in an immense,
highly elongated oval, condensing at the center into a blazing core
whose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward.</p>

<p id="id00419">"It's only a cluster of phosphorescent particles!" exclaimed one
of the officers.</p>

<p id="id00420">"No, sir," I answered with conviction.  "Not even angel-wing<br>

clams or salps have ever given off such a powerful light.<br>

That glow is basically electric in nature.  Besides . . . look, look!<br>

It's shifting!  It's moving back and forth!  It's darting at us!"<br></p>

<p id="id00421">A universal shout went up from the frigate.</p>

<p id="id00422">"Quiet!"  Commander Farragut said.  "Helm hard to leeward!<br>

Reverse engines!"<br></p>

<p id="id00423">Sailors rushed to the helm, engineers to their machinery.
Under reverse steam immediately, the Abraham Lincoln beat to port,
sweeping in a semicircle.</p>

<p id="id00424">"Right your helm!  Engines forward!"  Commander Farragut called.</p>

<p id="id00425">These orders were executed, and the frigate swiftly retreated
from this core of light.</p>

<p id="id00426">My mistake.  It wanted to retreat, but the unearthly animal came
at us with a speed double our own.</p>

<p id="id00427">We gasped.  More stunned than afraid, we stood mute and motionless.
The animal caught up with us, played with us.  It made a full
circle around the frigate&#8212;then doing fourteen knots&#8212;and wrapped
us in sheets of electricity that were like luminous dust.
Then it retreated two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent
trail comparable to those swirls of steam that shoot behind
the locomotive of an express train.  Suddenly, all the way from
the dark horizon where it had gone to gather momentum, the monster
abruptly dashed toward the Abraham Lincoln with frightening speed,
stopped sharply twenty feet from our side plates, and died out&#8212;
not by diving under the water, since its glow did not recede gradually&#8212;
but all at once, as if the source of this brilliant emanation had
suddenly dried up.  Then it reappeared on the other side of the ship,
either by circling around us or by gliding under our hull.
At any instant a collision could have occurred that would have been
fatal to us.</p>

<p id="id00428">Meanwhile I was astonished at the frigate's maneuvers.  It was fleeing,
not fighting.  Built to pursue, it was being pursued, and I commented
on this to Commander Farragut.  His face, ordinarily so emotionless,
was stamped with indescribable astonishment.</p>

<p id="id00429">"Professor Aronnax," he answered me, "I don't know what kind of
fearsome creature I'm up against, and I don't want my frigate running
foolish risks in all this darkness.  Besides, how should we attack
this unknown creature, how should we defend ourselves against it?
Let's wait for daylight, and then we'll play a different role."</p>

<p id="id00430">"You've no further doubts, commander, as to the nature of this animal?"</p>

<p id="id00431">"No, sir, it's apparently a gigantic narwhale, and an electric
one to boot."</p>

<p id="id00432">"Maybe," I added, "it's no more approachable than an electric eel
or an electric ray!"</p>

<p id="id00433">"Right," the commander replied.  "And if it has their power
to electrocute, it's surely the most dreadful animal ever conceived
by our Creator.  That's why I'll keep on my guard, sir."</p>

<p id="id00434">The whole crew stayed on their feet all night long.  No one even
thought of sleeping.  Unable to compete with the monster's speed,
the Abraham Lincoln slowed down and stayed at half steam.
For its part, the narwhale mimicked the frigate, simply rode with
the waves, and seemed determined not to forsake the field of battle.</p>

<p id="id00435">However, near midnight it disappeared, or to use a more appropriate
expression, "it went out," like a huge glowworm.  Had it fled from us?
We were duty bound to fear so rather than hope so.  But at 12:53
in the morning, a deafening hiss became audible, resembling the sound
made by a waterspout expelled with tremendous intensity.</p>

<p id="id00436">By then Commander Farragut, Ned Land, and I were on the afterdeck,
peering eagerly into the profound gloom.</p>

<p id="id00437">"Ned Land," the commander asked, "you've often heard whales bellowing?"</p>

<p id="id00438">"Often, sir, but never a whale like this, whose sighting
earned me $2,000.00."</p>

<p id="id00439">"Correct, the prize is rightfully yours.  But tell me, isn't that
the noise cetaceans make when they spurt water from their blowholes?"</p>

<p id="id00440">"The very noise, sir, but this one's way louder.  So there can
be no mistake.  There's definitely a whale lurking in our waters.
With your permission, sir," the harpooner added, "tomorrow at daybreak
we'll have words with it."</p>

<p id="id00441">"If it's in a mood to listen to you, Mr. Land," I replied in a tone
far from convinced.</p>

<p id="id00442">"Let me get within four harpoon lengths of it," the Canadian shot back,
"and it had better listen!"</p>

<p id="id00443">"But to get near it," the commander went on, "I'd have to put
a whaleboat at your disposal?"</p>

<p id="id00444">"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p id="id00445">"That would be gambling with the lives of my men."</p>

<p id="id00446">"And with my own!" the harpooner replied simply.</p>

<p id="id00447">Near two o'clock in the morning, the core of light reappeared,
no less intense, five miles to windward of the Abraham Lincoln.
Despite the distance, despite the noise of wind and sea, we could
distinctly hear the fearsome thrashings of the animal's tail,
and even its panting breath.  Seemingly, the moment this enormous
narwhale came up to breathe at the surface of the ocean,
air was sucked into its lungs like steam into the huge cylinders
of a 2,000-horsepower engine.</p>

<p id="id00448">"Hmm!"  I said to myself.  "A cetacean as powerful as a whole
cavalry regiment&#8212;now that's a whale of a whale!"</p>

<p id="id00449">We stayed on the alert until daylight, getting ready for action.
Whaling gear was set up along the railings.  Our chief officer loaded
the blunderbusses, which can launch harpoons as far as a mile,
and long duck guns with exploding bullets that can mortally wound
even the most powerful animals.  Ned Land was content to sharpen
his harpoon, a dreadful weapon in his hands.</p>

<p id="id00450">At six o'clock day began to break, and with the dawn's early light,
the narwhale's electric glow disappeared.  At seven o'clock the day
was well along, but a very dense morning mist shrank the horizon,
and our best spyglasses were unable to pierce it.  The outcome:
disappointment and anger.</p>

<p id="id00451">I hoisted myself up to the crosstrees of the mizzen sail.<br>

Some officers were already perched on the mastheads.<br></p>

<p id="id00452">At eight o'clock the mist rolled ponderously over the waves,
and its huge curls were lifting little by little.  The horizon grew
wider and clearer all at once.</p>

<p id="id00453">Suddenly, just as on the previous evening, Ned Land's voice was audible.</p>

<p id="id00454">"There's the thing in question, astern to port!" the harpooner shouted.</p>

<p id="id00455">Every eye looked toward the point indicated.</p>

<p id="id00456">There, a mile and a half from the frigate, a long blackish body
emerged a meter above the waves.  Quivering violently, its tail was
creating a considerable eddy.  Never had caudal equipment thrashed
the sea with such power.  An immense wake of glowing whiteness
marked the animal's track, sweeping in a long curve.</p>

<p id="id00457">Our frigate drew nearer to the cetacean.  I examined it with a completely
open mind.  Those reports from the Shannon and the Helvetia had slightly
exaggerated its dimensions, and I put its length at only 250 feet.
Its girth was more difficult to judge, but all in all, the animal
seemed to be wonderfully proportioned in all three dimensions.</p>

<p id="id00458">While I was observing this phenomenal creature, two jets of steam
and water sprang from its blowholes and rose to an altitude
of forty meters, which settled for me its mode of breathing.
From this I finally concluded that it belonged to the branch Vertebrata,
class Mammalia, subclass Monodelphia, group Pisciforma,
order Cetacea, family . . . but here I couldn't make up my mind.
The order Cetacea consists of three families, baleen whales,
sperm whales, dolphins, and it's in this last group that narwhales
are placed.  Each of these families is divided into several genera,
each genus into species, each species into varieties.
So I was still missing variety, species, genus, and family,
but no doubt I would complete my classifying with the aid of Heaven
and Commander Farragut.</p>

<p id="id00459">The crew were waiting impatiently for orders from their leader.
The latter, after carefully observing the animal, called for
his engineer.  The engineer raced over.</p>

<p id="id00460">"Sir," the commander said, "are you up to pressure?"</p>

<p id="id00461">"Aye, sir," the engineer replied.</p>

<p id="id00462">"Fine.  Stoke your furnaces and clap on full steam!"</p>

<p id="id00463">Three cheers greeted this order.  The hour of battle had sounded.
A few moments later, the frigate's two funnels vomited torrents
of black smoke, and its deck quaked from the trembling of its boilers.</p>

<p id="id00464">Driven forward by its powerful propeller, the Abraham Lincoln headed
straight for the animal.  Unconcerned, the latter let us come
within half a cable length; then, not bothering to dive, it got up
a little speed, retreated, and was content to keep its distance.</p>

<p id="id00465">This chase dragged on for about three-quarters of an hour without
the frigate gaining two fathoms on the cetacean.  At this rate,
it was obvious that we would never catch up with it.</p>

<p id="id00466">Infuriated, Commander Farragut kept twisting the thick tuft of hair
that flourished below his chin.</p>

<p id="id00467">"Ned Land!" he called.</p>

<p id="id00468">The Canadian reported at once.</p>

<p id="id00469">"Well, Mr. Land," the commander asked, "do you still advise putting
my longboats to sea?"</p>

<p id="id00470">"No, sir," Ned Land replied, "because that beast won't be caught
against its will."</p>

<p id="id00471">"Then what should we do?"</p>

<p id="id00472">"Stoke up more steam, sir, if you can.  As for me, with your
permission I'll go perch on the bobstays under the bowsprit,
and if we can get within a harpoon length, I'll harpoon the brute."</p>

<p id="id00473">"Go to it, Ned," Commander Farragut replied.  "Engineer," he called,
"keep the pressure mounting!"</p>

<p id="id00474">Ned Land made his way to his post.  The furnaces were urged
into greater activity; our propeller did forty-three revolutions
per minute, and steam shot from the valves.  Heaving the log,
we verified that the Abraham Lincoln was going at the rate of 18.5
miles per hour.</p>

<p id="id00475">But that damned animal also did a speed of 18.5.</p>

<p id="id00476">For the next hour our frigate kept up this pace without gaining a fathom!
This was humiliating for one of the fastest racers in the American navy.
The crew were working up into a blind rage.  Sailor after sailor heaved
insults at the monster, which couldn't be bothered with answering back.
Commander Farragut was no longer content simply to twist his goatee;
he chewed on it.</p>

<p id="id00477">The engineer was summoned once again.</p>

<p id="id00478">"You're up to maximum pressure?" the commander asked him.</p>

<p id="id00479">"Aye, sir," the engineer replied.</p>

<p id="id00480">"And your valves are charged to . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id00481">"To six and a half atmospheres."</p>

<p id="id00482">"Charge them to ten atmospheres."</p>

<p id="id00483">A typical American order if I ever heard one.  It would have
sounded just fine during some Mississippi paddle-wheeler race,
to "outstrip the competition!"</p>

<p id="id00484">"Conseil," I said to my gallant servant, now at my side, "you realize
that we'll probably blow ourselves skyhigh?"</p>

<p id="id00485">"As master wishes!"  Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id00486">All right, I admit it:  I did wish to run this risk!</p>

<p id="id00487">The valves were charged.  More coal was swallowed by the furnaces.
Ventilators shot torrents of air over the braziers.
The Abraham Lincoln's speed increased.  Its masts trembled down
to their blocks, and swirls of smoke could barely squeeze through
the narrow funnels.</p>

<p id="id00488">We heaved the log a second time.</p>

<p id="id00489">"Well, helmsman?"  Commander Farragut asked.</p>

<p id="id00490">"19.3 miles per hour, sir."</p>

<p id="id00491">"Keep stoking the furnaces."</p>

<p id="id00492">The engineer did so.  The pressure gauge marked ten atmospheres.
But no doubt the cetacean itself had "warmed up," because without
the least trouble, it also did 19.3.</p>

<p id="id00493">What a chase!  No, I can't describe the excitement that shook
my very being.  Ned Land stayed at his post, harpoon in hand.
Several times the animal let us approach.</p>

<p id="id00494">"We're overhauling it!" the Canadian would shout.</p>

<p id="id00495">Then, just as he was about to strike, the cetacean would steal off
with a swiftness I could estimate at no less than thirty miles per hour.
And even at our maximum speed, it took the liberty of thumbing
its nose at the frigate by running a full circle around us!
A howl of fury burst from every throat!</p>

<p id="id00496">By noon we were no farther along than at eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p id="id00497">Commander Farragut then decided to use more direct methods.</p>

<p id="id00498">"Bah!" he said.  "So that animal is faster than the Abraham Lincoln.<br>

All right, we'll see if it can outrun our conical shells!<br>

Mate, man the gun in the bow!"<br></p>

<p id="id00499">Our forecastle cannon was immediately loaded and leveled.
The cannoneer fired a shot, but his shell passed some feet above
the cetacean, which stayed half a mile off.</p>

<p id="id00500">"Over to somebody with better aim!" the commander shouted.<br>

"And $500.00 to the man who can pierce that infernal beast!"<br></p>

<p id="id00501">Calm of eye, cool of feature, an old gray-bearded gunner&#8212;
I can see him to this day&#8212;approached the cannon, put it in position,
and took aim for a good while.  There was a mighty explosion,
mingled with cheers from the crew.</p>

<p id="id00502">The shell reached its target; it hit the animal, but not in the
usual fashion&#8212;it bounced off that rounded surface and vanished
into the sea two miles out.</p>

<p id="id00503">"Oh drat!" said the old gunner in his anger.  "That rascal must
be covered with six-inch armor plate!"</p>

<p id="id00504">"Curse the beast!"  Commander Farragut shouted.</p>

<p id="id00505">The hunt was on again, and Commander Farragut leaned over to me, saying:</p>

<p id="id00506">"I'll chase that animal till my frigate explodes!"</p>

<p id="id00507">"Yes," I replied, "and nobody would blame you!"</p>

<p id="id00508">We could still hope that the animal would tire out and not be as
insensitive to exhaustion as our steam engines.  But no such luck.
Hour after hour went by without it showing the least sign of weariness.</p>

<p id="id00509">However, to the Abraham Lincoln's credit, it must be said that we
struggled on with tireless persistence.  I estimate that we covered
a distance of at least 500 kilometers during this ill-fated day
of November 6.  But night fell and wrapped the surging ocean
in its shadows.</p>

<p id="id00510">By then I thought our expedition had come to an end, that we would
never see this fantastic animal again.  I was mistaken.</p>

<p id="id00511">At 10:50 in the evening, that electric light reappeared three
miles to windward of the frigate, just as clear and intense
as the night before.</p>

<p id="id00512">The narwhale seemed motionless.  Was it asleep perhaps, weary from
its workday, just riding with the waves?  This was our chance,
and Commander Farragut was determined to take full advantage of it.</p>

<p id="id00513">He gave his orders.  The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam,
advancing cautiously so as not to awaken its adversary.
In midocean it's not unusual to encounter whales so sound asleep
they can successfully be attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned
more than one in its slumber.  The Canadian went to resume his post
on the bobstays under the bowsprit.</p>

<p id="id00514">The frigate approached without making a sound, stopped two cable
lengths from the animal and coasted.  Not a soul breathed on board.
A profound silence reigned over the deck.  We were not 100 feet
from the blazing core of light, whose glow grew stronger and
dazzled the eyes.</p>

<p id="id00515">Just then, leaning over the forecastle railing, I saw Ned Land
below me, one hand grasping the martingale, the other brandishing
his dreadful harpoon.  Barely twenty feet separated him from
the motionless animal.</p>

<p id="id00516">All at once his arm shot forward and the harpoon was launched.
I heard the weapon collide resonantly, as if it had hit
some hard substance.</p>

<p id="id00517">The electric light suddenly went out, and two enormous waterspouts
crashed onto the deck of the frigate, racing like a torrent from
stem to stern, toppling crewmen, breaking spare masts and yardarms
from their lashings.</p>

<p id="id00518">A hideous collision occurred, and thrown over the rail with no time
to catch hold of it, I was hurled into the sea.</p>

<h2 id="id00519">CHAPTER 7</h2>

<h6 id="id00520">A Whale of Unknown Species</h6>

<p id="id00521">ALTHOUGH I WAS startled by this unexpected descent, I at least
have a very clear recollection of my sensations during it.</p>

<p id="id00522">At first I was dragged about twenty feet under.  I'm a good swimmer,
without claiming to equal such other authors as Byron and Edgar Allan Poe,
who were master divers, and I didn't lose my head on the way down.
With two vigorous kicks of the heel, I came back to the surface
of the sea.</p>

<p id="id00523">My first concern was to look for the frigate.  Had the crew
seen me go overboard?  Was the Abraham Lincoln tacking about?
Would Commander Farragut put a longboat to sea?  Could I hope
to be rescued?</p>

<p id="id00524">The gloom was profound.  I glimpsed a black mass disappearing eastward,
where its running lights were fading out in the distance.
It was the frigate.  I felt I was done for.</p>

<p id="id00525">"Help!  Help!"  I shouted, swimming desperately toward the Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p id="id00526">My clothes were weighing me down.  The water glued them to
my body, they were paralyzing my movements.  I was sinking!
I was suffocating . . . !</p>

<p id="id00527">"Help!"</p>

<p id="id00528">This was the last shout I gave.  My mouth was filling with water.<br>

I struggled against being dragged into the depths. . . .<br></p>

<p id="id00529">Suddenly my clothes were seized by energetic hands, I felt myself
pulled abruptly back to the surface of the sea, and yes, I heard
these words pronounced in my ear:</p>

<p id="id00530">"If master would oblige me by leaning on my shoulder, master will
swim with much greater ease."</p>

<p id="id00531">With one hand I seized the arm of my loyal Conseil.</p>

<p id="id00532">"You!"  I said.  "You!"</p>

<p id="id00533">"Myself," Conseil replied, "and at master's command."</p>

<p id="id00534">"That collision threw you overboard along with me?"</p>

<p id="id00535">"Not at all.  But being in master's employ, I followed master."</p>

<p id="id00536">The fine lad thought this only natural!</p>

<p id="id00537">"What about the frigate?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id00538">"The frigate?"  Conseil replied, rolling over on his back.<br>

"I think master had best not depend on it to any great extent!"<br></p>

<p id="id00539">"What are you saying?"</p>

<p id="id00540">"I'm saying that just as I jumped overboard, I heard the men at
the helm shout, 'Our propeller and rudder are smashed!' "</p>

<p id="id00541">"Smashed?"</p>

<p id="id00542">"Yes, smashed by the monster's tusk!  I believe it's the sole injury
the Abraham Lincoln has sustained.  But most inconveniently for us,
the ship can no longer steer."</p>

<p id="id00543">"Then we're done for!"</p>

<p id="id00544">"Perhaps," Conseil replied serenely.  "However, we still have a few
hours before us, and in a few hours one can do a great many things!"</p>

<p id="id00545">Conseil's unflappable composure cheered me up.  I swam more vigorously,
but hampered by clothes that were as restricting as a cloak made
of lead, I was managing with only the greatest difficulty.
Conseil noticed as much.</p>

<p id="id00546">"Master will allow me to make an incision," he said.</p>

<p id="id00547">And he slipped an open clasp knife under my clothes, slitting them
from top to bottom with one swift stroke.  Then he briskly undressed
me while I swam for us both.</p>

<p id="id00548">I then did Conseil the same favor, and we continued to "navigate"
side by side.</p>

<p id="id00549">But our circumstances were no less dreadful.  Perhaps they
hadn't seen us go overboard; and even if they had, the frigate&#8212;
being undone by its rudder&#8212;couldn't return to leeward after us.
So we could count only on its longboats.</p>

<p id="id00550">Conseil had coolly reasoned out this hypothesis and laid his
plans accordingly.  An amazing character, this boy; in midocean,
this stoic lad seemed right at home!</p>

<p id="id00551">So, having concluded that our sole chance for salvation
lay in being picked up by the Abraham Lincoln's longboats,
we had to take steps to wait for them as long as possible.
Consequently, I decided to divide our energies so we wouldn't
both be worn out at the same time, and this was the arrangement:
while one of us lay on his back, staying motionless with arms crossed and
legs outstretched, the other would swim and propel his partner forward.
This towing role was to last no longer than ten minutes, and by
relieving each other in this way, we could stay afloat for hours,
perhaps even until daybreak.</p>

<p id="id00552">Slim chance, but hope springs eternal in the human breast!
Besides, there were two of us.  Lastly, I can vouch&#8212;as improbable
as it seems&#8212;that even if I had wanted to destroy all my illusions,
even if I had been willing to "give in to despair," I could not
have done so!</p>

<p id="id00553">The cetacean had rammed our frigate at about eleven o'clock
in the evening.  I therefore calculated on eight hours of swimming
until sunrise.  A strenuous task, but feasible, thanks to our
relieving each other.  The sea was pretty smooth and barely tired us.
Sometimes I tried to peer through the dense gloom, which was broken
only by the phosphorescent flickers coming from our movements.
I stared at the luminous ripples breaking over my hands,
shimmering sheets spattered with blotches of bluish gray.
It seemed as if we'd plunged into a pool of quicksilver.</p>

<p id="id00554">Near one o'clock in the morning, I was overcome with
tremendous exhaustion.  My limbs stiffened in the grip of intense cramps.
Conseil had to keep me going, and attending to our self-preservation
became his sole responsibility.  I soon heard the poor lad gasping;
his breathing became shallow and quick.  I didn't think he could
stand such exertions for much longer.</p>

<p id="id00555">"Go on!  Go on!"  I told him.</p>

<p id="id00556">"Leave master behind?" he replied.  "Never!  I'll drown before he does!"</p>

<p id="id00557">Just then, past the fringes of a large cloud that the wind was
driving eastward, the moon appeared.  The surface of the sea
glistened under its rays.  That kindly light rekindled our strength.
I held up my head again.  My eyes darted to every point of the horizon.
I spotted the frigate.  It was five miles from us and formed no
more than a dark, barely perceptible mass.  But as for longboats,
not a one in sight!</p>

<p id="id00558">I tried to call out.  What was the use at such a distance!
My swollen lips wouldn't let a single sound through.  Conseil could
still articulate a few words, and I heard him repeat at intervals:</p>

<p id="id00559">"Help!  Help!"</p>

<p id="id00560">Ceasing all movement for an instant, we listened.  And it may have
been a ringing in my ear, from this organ filling with impeded blood,
but it seemed to me that Conseil's shout had received an answer back.</p>

<p id="id00561">"Did you hear that?"  I muttered.</p>

<p id="id00562">"Yes, yes!"</p>

<p id="id00563">And Conseil hurled another desperate plea into space.</p>

<p id="id00564">This time there could be no mistake!  A human voice had answered us!<br>

Was it the voice of some poor devil left behind in midocean,<br>

some other victim of that collision suffered by our ship?<br>

Or was it one of the frigate's longboats, hailing us out of the gloom?<br></p>

<p id="id00565">Conseil made one final effort, and bracing his hands on my shoulders,
while I offered resistance with one supreme exertion, he raised
himself half out of the water, then fell back exhausted.</p>

<p id="id00566">"What did you see?"</p>

<p id="id00567">"I saw . . . ," he muttered, "I saw . . . but we mustn't talk . . .
save our strength . . . !"</p>

<p id="id00568">What had he seen?  Then, lord knows why, the thought of the monster came
into my head for the first time . . . !  But even so, that voice . . . ?
Gone are the days when Jonahs took refuge in the bellies of whales!</p>

<p id="id00569">Nevertheless, Conseil kept towing me.  Sometimes he looked up,
stared straight ahead, and shouted a request for directions,
which was answered by a voice that was getting closer and closer.
I could barely hear it.  I was at the end of my strength; my fingers
gave out; my hands were no help to me; my mouth opened convulsively,
filling with brine; its coldness ran through me; I raised my head
one last time, then I collapsed. . . .</p>

<p id="id00570">Just then something hard banged against me.  I clung to it.
Then I felt myself being pulled upward, back to the surface of the water;
my chest caved in, and I fainted. . . .</p>

<p id="id00571">For certain, I came to quickly, because someone was massaging me
so vigorously it left furrows in my flesh.  I half opened my eyes. . . .</p>

<p id="id00572">"Conseil!"  I muttered.</p>

<p id="id00573">"Did master ring for me?"  Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id00574">Just then, in the last light of a moon settling on the horizon,<br>

I spotted a face that wasn't Conseil's but which I recognized at once.<br></p>

<p id="id00575">"Ned!"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id00576">"In person, sir, and still after his prize!" the Canadian replied.</p>

<p id="id00577">"You were thrown overboard after the frigate's collision?"</p>

<p id="id00578">"Yes, professor, but I was luckier than you, and right away I was
able to set foot on this floating islet."</p>

<p id="id00579">"Islet?"</p>

<p id="id00580">"Or in other words, on our gigantic narwhale."</p>

<p id="id00581">"Explain yourself, Ned."</p>

<p id="id00582">"It's just that I soon realized why my harpoon got blunted and couldn't
puncture its hide."</p>

<p id="id00583">"Why, Ned, why?"</p>

<p id="id00584">"Because, professor, this beast is made of boilerplate steel!"</p>

<p id="id00585">At this point in my story, I need to get a grip on myself,
reconstruct exactly what I experienced, and make doubly sure
of everything I write.</p>

<p id="id00586">The Canadian's last words caused a sudden upheaval in my brain.
I swiftly hoisted myself to the summit of this half-submerged creature
or object that was serving as our refuge.  I tested it with my foot.
Obviously it was some hard, impenetrable substance, not the soft
matter that makes up the bodies of our big marine mammals.</p>

<p id="id00587">But this hard substance could have been a bony carapace, like those
that covered some prehistoric animals, and I might have left it
at that and classified this monster among such amphibious reptiles
as turtles or alligators.</p>

<p id="id00588">Well, no.  The blackish back supporting me was smooth and polished
with no overlapping scales.  On impact, it gave off a metallic sonority,
and as incredible as this sounds, it seemed, I swear, to be made
of riveted plates.</p>

<p id="id00589">No doubts were possible!  This animal, this monster, this natural
phenomenon that had puzzled the whole scientific world, that had
muddled and misled the minds of seamen in both hemispheres, was,
there could be no escaping it, an even more astonishing phenomenon&#8212;
a phenomenon made by the hand of man.</p>

<p id="id00590">Even if I had discovered that some fabulous, mythological creature
really existed, it wouldn't have given me such a terrific mental jolt.
It's easy enough to accept that prodigious things can come from
our Creator.  But to find, all at once, right before your eyes,
that the impossible had been mysteriously achieved by man himself:
this staggers the mind!</p>

<p id="id00591">But there was no question now.  We were stretched out on the back
of some kind of underwater boat that, as far as I could judge,
boasted the shape of an immense steel fish.  Ned Land had clear
views on the issue.  Conseil and I could only line up behind him.</p>

<p id="id00592">"But then," I said, "does this contraption contain some sort
of locomotive mechanism, and a crew to run it?"</p>

<p id="id00593">"Apparently," the harpooner replied.  "And yet for the three hours<br>

I've lived on this floating island, it hasn't shown a sign of life."<br></p>

<p id="id00594">"This boat hasn't moved at all?"</p>

<p id="id00595">"No, Professor Aronnax.  It just rides with the waves, but otherwise
it hasn't stirred."</p>

<p id="id00596">"But we know that it's certainly gifted with great speed.
Now then, since an engine is needed to generate that speed,
and a mechanic to run that engine, I conclude:  we're saved."</p>

<p id="id00597">"Humph!"  Ned Land put in, his tone denoting reservations.</p>

<p id="id00598">Just then, as if to take my side in the argument, a bubbling began
astern of this strange submersible&#8212;whose drive mechanism was obviously
a propeller&#8212;and the boat started to move.  We barely had time to hang
on to its topside, which emerged about eighty centimeters above water.
Fortunately its speed was not excessive.</p>

<p id="id00599">"So long as it navigates horizontally," Ned Land muttered,
"I've no complaints.  But if it gets the urge to dive, I wouldn't
give $2.00 for my hide!"</p>

<p id="id00600">The Canadian might have quoted a much lower price.
So it was imperative to make contact with whatever beings were
confined inside the plating of this machine.  I searched its surface
for an opening or a hatch, a "manhole," to use the official term;
but the lines of rivets had been firmly driven into the sheet-iron
joins and were straight and uniform.</p>

<p id="id00601">Moreover, the moon then disappeared and left us in profound darkness.
We had to wait for daylight to find some way of getting inside
this underwater boat.</p>

<p id="id00602">So our salvation lay totally in the hands of the mysterious helmsmen
steering this submersible, and if it made a dive, we were done for!
But aside from this occurring, I didn't doubt the possibility
of our making contact with them.  In fact, if they didn't produce
their own air, they inevitably had to make periodic visits
to the surface of the ocean to replenish their oxygen supply.
Hence the need for some opening that put the boat's interior
in contact with the atmosphere.</p>

<p id="id00603">As for any hope of being rescued by Commander Farragut, that had to be
renounced completely.  We were being swept westward, and I estimate
that our comparatively moderate speed reached twelve miles per hour.
The propeller churned the waves with mathematical regularity,
sometimes emerging above the surface and throwing phosphorescent
spray to great heights.</p>

<p id="id00604">Near four o'clock in the morning, the submersible picked up speed.
We could barely cope with this dizzying rush, and the waves battered
us at close range.  Fortunately Ned's hands came across a big
mooring ring fastened to the topside of this sheet-iron back,
and we all held on for dear life.</p>

<p id="id00605">Finally this long night was over.  My imperfect memories won't let me
recall my every impression of it.  A single detail comes back to me.
Several times, during various lulls of wind and sea, I thought I
heard indistinct sounds, a sort of elusive harmony produced by
distant musical chords.  What was the secret behind this underwater
navigating, whose explanation the whole world had sought in vain?
What beings lived inside this strange boat?  What mechanical force
allowed it to move about with such prodigious speed?</p>

<p id="id00606">Daylight appeared.  The morning mists surrounded us, but they
soon broke up.  I was about to proceed with a careful examination
of the hull, whose topside formed a sort of horizontal platform,
when I felt it sinking little by little.</p>

<p id="id00607">"Oh, damnation!"  Ned Land shouted, stamping his foot on the resonant
sheet iron.  "Open up there, you antisocial navigators!"</p>

<p id="id00608">But it was difficult to make yourself heard above the deafening beats
of the propeller.  Fortunately this submerging movement stopped.</p>

<p id="id00609">From inside the boat, there suddenly came noises of iron fastenings
pushed roughly aside.  One of the steel plates flew up, a man appeared,
gave a bizarre yell, and instantly disappeared.</p>

<p id="id00610">A few moments later, eight strapping fellows appeared silently,
their faces like masks, and dragged us down into their fearsome machine.</p>

<h2 id="id00611">CHAPTER 8</h2>

<h6 id="id00612">"Mobilis in Mobili"</h6>

<p id="id00613">THIS BRUTALLY EXECUTED capture was carried out with lightning speed.
My companions and I had no time to collect ourselves.  I don't
know how they felt about being shoved inside this aquatic prison,
but as for me, I was shivering all over.  With whom were we dealing?
Surely with some new breed of pirates, exploiting the sea after
their own fashion.</p>

<p id="id00614">The narrow hatch had barely closed over me when I was surrounded by
profound darkness.  Saturated with the outside light, my eyes couldn't
make out a thing.  I felt my naked feet clinging to the steps of an
iron ladder.  Forcibly seized, Ned Land and Conseil were behind me.
At the foot of the ladder, a door opened and instantly closed behind
us with a loud clang.</p>

<p id="id00615">We were alone.  Where?  I couldn't say, could barely even imagine.
All was darkness, but such utter darkness that after several minutes,
my eyes were still unable to catch a single one of those hazy gleams
that drift through even the blackest nights.</p>

<p id="id00616">Meanwhile, furious at these goings on, Ned Land gave free rein
to his indignation.</p>

<p id="id00617">"Damnation!" he exclaimed.  "These people are about as hospitable
as the savages of New Caledonia!  All that's lacking is for them
to be cannibals!  I wouldn't be surprised if they were, but believe
you me, they won't eat me without my kicking up a protest!"</p>

<p id="id00618">"Calm yourself, Ned my friend," Conseil replied serenely.<br>

"Don't flare up so quickly!  We aren't in a kettle yet!"<br></p>

<p id="id00619">"In a kettle, no," the Canadian shot back, "but in an oven for sure.
It's dark enough for one.  Luckily my Bowie knife hasn't left me,
and I can still see well enough to put it to use.<a id="noteref-5" href="twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-seas-8.html#note-5">[5]</a> The first one
of these bandits who lays a hand on me&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00621">"Don't be so irritable, Ned," I then told the harpooner,
"and don't ruin things for us with pointless violence.
Who knows whether they might be listening to us?  Instead, let's try
to find out where we are!"</p>

<p id="id00622">I started moving, groping my way.  After five steps I encountered
an iron wall made of riveted boilerplate.  Then, turning around,
I bumped into a wooden table next to which several stools had been set.
The floor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick, hempen matting
that deadened the sound of footsteps.  Its naked walls didn't reveal
any trace of a door or window.  Going around the opposite way,
Conseil met up with me, and we returned to the middle of this cabin,
which had to be twenty feet long by ten wide.  As for its height,
not even Ned Land, with his great stature, was able to determine it.</p>

<p id="id00623">Half an hour had already gone by without our situation changing,
when our eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into
blinding light.  Our prison lit up all at once; in other words,
it filled with luminescent matter so intense that at first I
couldn't stand the brightness of it.  From its glare and whiteness,
I recognized the electric glow that had played around this
underwater boat like some magnificent phosphorescent phenomenon.
After involuntarily closing my eyes, I reopened them and saw
that this luminous force came from a frosted half globe curving
out of the cabin's ceiling.</p>

<p id="id00624">"Finally!  It's light enough to see!"  Ned Land exclaimed, knife in hand,
staying on the defensive.</p>

<p id="id00625">"Yes," I replied, then ventured the opposite view.  "But as for
our situation, we're still in the dark."</p>

<p id="id00626">"Master must learn patience," said the emotionless Conseil.</p>

<p id="id00627">This sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its
tiniest details.  It contained only a table and five stools.
Its invisible door must have been hermetically sealed.
Not a sound reached our ears.  Everything seemed dead inside this boat.
Was it in motion, or stationary on the surface of the ocean,
or sinking into the depths?  I couldn't tell.</p>

<p id="id00628">But this luminous globe hadn't been turned on without good reason.<br>

Consequently, I hoped that some crewmen would soon make an appearance.<br>

If you want to consign people to oblivion, you don't light<br>

up their dungeons.<br></p>

<p id="id00629">I was not mistaken.  Unlocking noises became audible, a door opened,
and two men appeared.</p>

<p id="id00630">One was short and stocky, powerfully muscled, broad shouldered,
robust of limbs, the head squat, the hair black and luxuriant,
the mustache heavy, the eyes bright and penetrating, and his
whole personality stamped with that southern-blooded zest that,
in France, typifies the people of Provence.  The philosopher
Diderot has very aptly claimed that a man's bearing is the clue
to his character, and this stocky little man was certainly
a living proof of this claim.  You could sense that his everyday
conversation must have been packed with such vivid figures of
speech as personification, symbolism, and misplaced modifiers.
But I was never in a position to verify this because, around me,
he used only an odd and utterly incomprehensible dialect.</p>

<p id="id00631">The second stranger deserves a more detailed description.
A disciple of such character-judging anatomists as Gratiolet
or Engel could have read this man's features like an open book.
Without hesitation, I identified his dominant qualities&#8212;
self-confidence, since his head reared like a nobleman's above the arc
formed by the lines of his shoulders, and his black eyes gazed
with icy assurance; calmness, since his skin, pale rather than ruddy,
indicated tranquility of blood; energy, shown by the swiftly knitting
muscles of his brow; and finally courage, since his deep breathing
denoted tremendous reserves of vitality.</p>

<p id="id00632">I might add that this was a man of great pride, that his calm,
firm gaze seemed to reflect thinking on an elevated plane,
and that the harmony of his facial expressions and bodily
movements resulted in an overall effect of unquestionable candor&#8212;
according to the findings of physiognomists, those analysts
of facial character.</p>

<p id="id00633">I felt "involuntarily reassured" in his presence, and this boded
well for our interview.</p>

<p id="id00634">Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age,
I could not precisely state.  He was tall, his forehead broad,
his nose straight, his mouth clearly etched, his teeth magnificent,
his hands refined, tapered, and to use a word from palmistry,
highly "psychic," in other words, worthy of serving a lofty
and passionate spirit.  This man was certainly the most wonderful
physical specimen I had ever encountered.  One unusual detail:
his eyes were spaced a little far from each other and could
instantly take in nearly a quarter of the horizon.  This ability&#8212;
as I later verified&#8212;was strengthened by a range of vision even greater
than Ned Land's. When this stranger focused his gaze on an object,
his eyebrow lines gathered into a frown, his heavy eyelids closed
around his pupils to contract his huge field of vision, and he looked!
What a look&#8212;as if he could magnify objects shrinking into the distance;
as if he could probe your very soul; as if he could pierce those sheets
of water so opaque to our eyes and scan the deepest seas . . . !</p>

<p id="id00635">Wearing caps made of sea-otter fur, and shod in sealskin fishing boots,
these two strangers were dressed in clothing made from some unique
fabric that flattered the figure and allowed great freedom of movement.</p>

<p id="id00636">The taller of the two&#8212;apparently the leader on board&#8212;examined us
with the greatest care but without pronouncing a word.  Then, turning to
his companion, he conversed with him in a language I didn't recognize.
It was a sonorous, harmonious, flexible dialect whose vowels seemed
to undergo a highly varied accentuation.</p>

<p id="id00637">The other replied with a shake of the head and added two or three
utterly incomprehensible words.  Then he seemed to question me
directly with a long stare.</p>

<p id="id00638">I replied in clear French that I wasn't familiar with his language;
but he didn't seem to understand me, and the situation
grew rather baffling.</p>

<p id="id00639">"Still, master should tell our story," Conseil said to me.<br>

"Perhaps these gentlemen will grasp a few words of it!"<br></p>

<p id="id00640">I tried again, telling the tale of our adventures, clearly articulating
my every syllable, and not leaving out a single detail.  I stated
our names and titles; then, in order, I introduced Professor Aronnax,
his manservant Conseil, and Mr. Ned Land, harpooner.</p>

<p id="id00641">The man with calm, gentle eyes listened to me serenely,
even courteously, and paid remarkable attention.  But nothing
in his facial expression indicated that he understood my story.
When I finished, he didn't pronounce a single word.</p>

<p id="id00642">One resource still left was to speak English.  Perhaps they would
be familiar with this nearly universal language.  But I only knew it,
as I did the German language, well enough to read it fluently,
not well enough to speak it correctly.  Here, however, our overriding
need was to make ourselves understood.</p>

<p id="id00643">"Come on, it's your turn," I told the harpooner.  "Over to you,
Mr. Land.  Pull out of your bag of tricks the best English ever spoken
by an Anglo-Saxon, and try for a more favorable result than mine."</p>

<p id="id00644">Ned needed no persuading and started our story all over again,
most of which I could follow.  Its content was the same,
but the form differed.  Carried away by his volatile temperament,
the Canadian put great animation into it.  He complained
vehemently about being imprisoned in defiance of his civil rights,
asked by virtue of which law he was hereby detained, invoked writs
of habeas corpus, threatened to press charges against anyone holding
him in illegal custody, ranted, gesticulated, shouted, and finally
conveyed by an expressive gesture that we were dying of hunger.</p>

<p id="id00645">This was perfectly true, but we had nearly forgotten the fact.</p>

<p id="id00646">Much to his amazement, the harpooner seemed no more intelligible
than I had been.  Our visitors didn't bat an eye.  Apparently they
were engineers who understood the languages of neither the French
physicist Arago nor the English physicist Faraday.</p>

<p id="id00647">Thoroughly baffled after vainly exhausting our philological resources,<br>

I no longer knew what tactic to pursue, when Conseil told me:<br></p>

<p id="id00648">"If master will authorize me, I'll tell the whole business in German."</p>

<p id="id00649">"What!  You know German?"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id00650">"Like most Flemish people, with all due respect to master."</p>

<p id="id00651">"On the contrary, my respect is due you.  Go to it, my boy."</p>

<p id="id00652">And Conseil, in his serene voice, described for the third time
the various vicissitudes of our story.  But despite our narrator's
fine accent and stylish turns of phrase, the German language met
with no success.</p>

<p id="id00653">Finally, as a last resort, I hauled out everything I could
remember from my early schooldays, and I tried to narrate our
adventures in Latin.  Cicero would have plugged his ears and sent
me to the scullery, but somehow I managed to pull through.
With the same negative result.</p>

<p id="id00654">This last attempt ultimately misfiring, the two strangers exchanged
a few words in their incomprehensible language and withdrew,
not even favoring us with one of those encouraging gestures that are
used in every country in the world.  The door closed again.</p>

<p id="id00655">"This is outrageous!"  Ned Land shouted, exploding for the
twentieth time.  "I ask you!  We speak French, English, German,
and Latin to these rogues, and neither of them has the decency
to even answer back!"</p>

<p id="id00656">"Calm down, Ned," I told the seething harpooner.  "Anger won't
get us anywhere."</p>

<p id="id00657">"But professor," our irascible companion went on, "can't you see
that we could die of hunger in this iron cage?"</p>

<p id="id00658">"Bah!"  Conseil put in philosophically.  "We can hold out a
good while yet!"</p>

<p id="id00659">"My friends," I said, "we mustn't despair.  We've gotten out of
tighter spots.  So please do me the favor of waiting a bit before
you form your views on the commander and crew of this boat."</p>

<p id="id00660">"My views are fully formed," Ned Land shot back.  "They're rogues!"</p>

<p id="id00661">"Oh good!  And from what country?"</p>

<p id="id00662">"Roguedom!"</p>

<p id="id00663">"My gallant Ned, as yet that country isn't clearly marked on maps of
the world, but I admit that the nationality of these two strangers is hard
to make out!  Neither English, French, nor German, that's all we can say.
But I'm tempted to think that the commander and his chief officer
were born in the low latitudes.  There must be southern blood in them.
But as to whether they're Spaniards, Turks, Arabs, or East Indians,
their physical characteristics don't give me enough to go on.
And as for their speech, it's utterly incomprehensible."</p>

<p id="id00664">"That's the nuisance in not knowing every language," Conseil replied,
"or the drawback in not having one universal language!"</p>

<p id="id00665">"Which would all go out the window!"  Ned Land replied.
"Don't you see, these people have a language all to themselves,
a language they've invented just to cause despair in decent people
who ask for a little dinner!  Why, in every country on earth,
when you open your mouth, snap your jaws, smack your lips and teeth,
isn't that the world's most understandable message?  From Quebec
to the Tuamotu Islands, from Paris to the Antipodes, doesn't it mean:
I'm hungry, give me a bite to eat!"</p>

<p id="id00666">"Oh," Conseil put in, "there are some people so unintelligent
by nature . . ."</p>

<p id="id00667">As he was saying these words, the door opened.  A
steward entered.<a id="noteref-6"
href="twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-seas-8.html#note-6">[6]</a> He
brought us some clothes, jackets and sailor's pants, made out of a
fabric whose nature I didn't recognize.  I hurried to change into
them, and my companions followed suit.</p>

<p id="id00669">Meanwhile our silent steward, perhaps a deaf-mute, set the table
and laid three place settings.</p>

<p id="id00670">"There's something serious afoot," Conseil said, "and it bodes well."</p>

<p id="id00671">"Bah!" replied the rancorous harpooner.  "What the devil do you suppose
they eat around here?  Turtle livers, loin of shark, dogfish steaks?"</p>

<p id="id00672">"We'll soon find out!"  Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id00673">Overlaid with silver dish covers, various platters had been
neatly positioned on the table cloth, and we sat down to eat.
Assuredly, we were dealing with civilized people, and if it hadn't
been for this electric light flooding over us, I would have thought
we were in the dining room of the Hotel Adelphi in Liverpool,
or the Grand Hotel in Paris.  However, I feel compelled to mention
that bread and wine were totally absent.  The water was fresh and clear,
but it was still water&#8212;which wasn't what Ned Land had in mind.
Among the foods we were served, I was able to identify various
daintily dressed fish; but I couldn't make up my mind about certain
otherwise excellent dishes, and I couldn't even tell whether
their contents belonged to the vegetable or the animal kingdom.
As for the tableware, it was elegant and in perfect taste.
Each utensil, spoon, fork, knife, and plate, bore on its reverse
a letter encircled by a Latin motto, and here is its exact duplicate:</p>

<h6 id="id00674">MOBILIS IN MOBILI</h6>

<h6 id="id00675">N</h6>

<p id="id00676">Moving within the moving element!  It was a highly appropriate
motto for this underwater machine, so long as the preposition
in is translated as within and not upon.  The letter N was no doubt
the initial of the name of that mystifying individual in command
beneath the seas!</p>

<p id="id00677">Ned and Conseil had no time for such musings.  They were wolfing
down their food, and without further ado I did the same.
By now I felt reassured about our fate, and it seemed obvious
that our hosts didn't intend to let us die of starvation.</p>

<p id="id00678">But all earthly things come to an end, all things must pass,
even the hunger of people who haven't eaten for fifteen hours.
Our appetites appeased, we felt an urgent need for sleep.
A natural reaction after that interminable night of fighting
for our lives.</p>

<p id="id00679">"Ye gods, I'll sleep soundly," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id00680">"Me, I'm out like a light!"  Ned Land replied.</p>

<p id="id00681">My two companions lay down on the cabin's carpeting and were soon
deep in slumber.</p>

<p id="id00682">As for me, I gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep.
Too many thoughts had piled up in my mind, too many insoluble
questions had arisen, too many images were keeping my eyelids open!
Where were we?  What strange power was carrying us along?
I felt&#8212;or at least I thought I did&#8212;the submersible sinking
toward the sea's lower strata.  Intense nightmares besieged me.
In these mysterious marine sanctuaries, I envisioned hosts
of unknown animals, and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood
relation of theirs:  living, breathing, just as fearsome . . . !
Then my mind grew calmer, my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness,
and I soon fell into an uneasy slumber.</p>
