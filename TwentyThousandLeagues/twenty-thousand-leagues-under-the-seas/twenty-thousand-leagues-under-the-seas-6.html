<h2 id="id01291">CHAPTER 18</h2>

<h6 id="id01292">Four Thousand Leagues Under the Pacific</h6>

<p id="id01293">BY THE NEXT MORNING, November 18, I was fully recovered from my
exhaustion of the day before, and I climbed onto the platform just
as the Nautilus's chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase.
It then occurred to me that these words either referred to the state
of the sea, or that they meant:  "There's nothing in sight."</p>

<p id="id01294">And in truth, the ocean was deserted.  Not a sail on the horizon.
The tips of Crespo Island had disappeared during the night.
The sea, absorbing every color of the prism except its blue rays,
reflected the latter in every direction and sported a wonderful
indigo tint.  The undulating waves regularly took on the appearance
of watered silk with wide stripes.</p>

<p id="id01295">I was marveling at this magnificent ocean view when
Captain Nemo appeared.  He didn't seem to notice my presence and began
a series of astronomical observations.  Then, his operations finished,
he went and leaned his elbows on the beacon housing, his eyes
straying over the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p id="id01296">Meanwhile some twenty of the Nautilus's sailors&#8212;all energetic,
well-built fellows&#8212;climbed onto the platform.  They had come
to pull up the nets left in our wake during the night.
These seamen obviously belonged to different nationalities, although
indications of European physical traits could be seen in them all.
If I'm not mistaken, I recognized some Irishmen, some Frenchmen,
a few Slavs, and a native of either Greece or Crete.  Even so,
these men were frugal of speech and used among themselves
only that bizarre dialect whose origin I couldn't even guess.
So I had to give up any notions of questioning them.</p>

<p id="id01297">The nets were hauled on board.  They were a breed of trawl resembling
those used off the Normandy coast, huge pouches held half open
by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes.
Trailing in this way from these iron glove makers, the resulting
receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit
in their path.  That day they gathered up some unusual specimens
from these fish-filled waterways:  anglerfish whose comical movements
qualify them for the epithet "clowns," black Commerson anglers equipped
with their antennas, undulating triggerfish encircled by little
red bands, bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious,
some olive-hued lampreys, snipefish covered with silver scales,
cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel
and the electric ray, scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands,
greenish codfish, several varieties of goby, etc.; finally, some fish
of larger proportions:  a one-meter jack with a prominent head,
several fine bonito from the genus Scomber decked out in the colors
blue and silver, and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds
couldn't save them from our trawl.</p>

<p id="id01298">I estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000
pounds of fish.  It was a fine catch but not surprising.
In essence, these nets stayed in our wake for several hours,
incarcerating an entire aquatic world in prisons made of thread.
So we were never lacking in provisions of the highest quality,
which the Nautilus's speed and the allure of its electric light
could continually replenish.</p>

<p id="id01299">These various exhibits from the sea were immediately lowered
down the hatch in the direction of the storage lockers, some to be
eaten fresh, others to be preserved.</p>

<p id="id01300">After its fishing was finished and its air supply renewed,
I thought the Nautilus would resume its underwater excursion,
and I was getting ready to return to my stateroom, when Captain Nemo
turned to me and said without further preamble:</p>

<p id="id01301">"Look at this ocean, professor!  Doesn't it have the actual
gift of life?  Doesn't it experience both anger and affection?
Last evening it went to sleep just as we did, and there it is,
waking up after a peaceful night!"</p>

<p id="id01302">No hellos or good mornings for this gent!  You would have thought
this eccentric individual was simply continuing a conversation
we'd already started!</p>

<p id="id01303">"See!" he went on.  "It's waking up under the sun's caresses!
It's going to relive its daily existence!  What a fascinating
field of study lies in watching the play of its organism.
It owns a pulse and arteries, it has spasms, and I side with the
scholarly Commander Maury, who discovered that it has a circulation
as real as the circulation of blood in animals."</p>

<p id="id01304">I'm sure that Captain Nemo expected no replies from me, and it
seemed pointless to pitch in with "Ah yes," "Exactly," or "How
right you are!"  Rather, he was simply talking to himself,
with long pauses between sentences.  He was meditating out loud.</p>

<p id="id01305">"Yes," he said, "the ocean owns a genuine circulation,
and to start it going, the Creator of All Things has only
to increase its heat, salt, and microscopic animal life.
In essence, heat creates the different densities that lead
to currents and countercurrents.  Evaporation, which is nil
in the High Arctic regions and very active in equatorial zones,
brings about a constant interchange of tropical and polar waters.
What's more, I've detected those falling and rising currents that make
up the ocean's true breathing.  I've seen a molecule of salt water
heat up at the surface, sink into the depths, reach maximum density
at -2 degrees centigrade, then cool off, grow lighter, and rise again.
At the poles you'll see the consequences of this phenomenon,
and through this law of farseeing nature, you'll understand why
water can freeze only at the surface!"</p>

<p id="id01306">As the captain was finishing his sentence, I said to myself:
"The pole!  Is this brazen individual claiming he'll take us even
to that location?"</p>

<p id="id01307">Meanwhile the captain fell silent and stared at the element he had
studied so thoroughly and unceasingly.  Then, going on:</p>

<p id="id01308">"Salts," he said, "fill the sea in considerable quantities, professor,
and if you removed all its dissolved saline content, you'd create
a mass measuring 4,500,000 cubic leagues, which if it were spread
all over the globe, would form a layer more than ten meters high.
And don't think that the presence of these salts is due merely
to some whim of nature.  No. They make ocean water less open to
evaporation and prevent winds from carrying off excessive amounts
of steam, which, when condensing, would submerge the temperate zones.
Salts play a leading role, the role of stabilizer for the general
ecology of the globe!"</p>

<p id="id01309">Captain Nemo stopped, straightened up, took a few steps along
the platform, and returned to me:</p>

<p id="id01310">"As for those billions of tiny animals," he went on, "those infusoria
that live by the millions in one droplet of water, 800,000 of which
are needed to weigh one milligram, their role is no less important.
They absorb the marine salts, they assimilate the solid elements
in the water, and since they create coral and madrepores,
they're the true builders of limestone continents!  And so,
after they've finished depriving our water drop of its mineral nutrients,
the droplet gets lighter, rises to the surface, there absorbs more
salts left behind through evaporation, gets heavier, sinks again,
and brings those tiny animals new elements to absorb.  The outcome:
a double current, rising and falling, constant movement, constant life!
More intense than on land, more abundant, more infinite, such life
blooms in every part of this ocean, an element fatal to man,
they say, but vital to myriads of animals&#8212;and to me!"</p>

<p id="id01311">When Captain Nemo spoke in this way, he was transfigured,
and he filled me with extraordinary excitement.</p>

<p id="id01312">"There," he added, "out there lies true existence!  And I can imagine
the founding of nautical towns, clusters of underwater households that,
like the Nautilus, would return to the surface of the sea to breathe
each morning, free towns if ever there were, independent cities!
Then again, who knows whether some tyrant . . ."</p>

<p id="id01313">Captain Nemo finished his sentence with a vehement gesture.<br>

Then, addressing me directly, as if to drive away an ugly thought:<br></p>

<p id="id01314">"Professor Aronnax," he asked me, "do you know the depth of
the ocean floor?"</p>

<p id="id01315">"At least, captain, I know what the major soundings tell us."</p>

<p id="id01316">"Could you quote them to me, so I can double-check them as
the need arises?"</p>

<p id="id01317">"Here," I replied, "are a few of them that stick in my memory.
If I'm not mistaken, an average depth of 8,200 meters was found in
the north Atlantic, and 2,500 meters in the Mediterranean.  The most
remarkable soundings were taken in the south Atlantic near the 35th
parallel, and they gave 12,000 meters, 14,091 meters, and 15,149 meters.
All in all, it's estimated that if the sea bottom were made level,
its average depth would be about seven kilometers."</p>

<p id="id01318">"Well, professor," Captain Nemo replied, "we'll show you better
than that, I hope.  As for the average depth of this part of
the Pacific, I'll inform you that it's a mere 4,000 meters."</p>

<p id="id01319">This said, Captain Nemo headed to the hatch and disappeared down
the ladder.  I followed him and went back to the main lounge.
The propeller was instantly set in motion, and the log gave our speed
as twenty miles per hour.</p>

<p id="id01320">Over the ensuing days and weeks, Captain Nemo was very frugal
with his visits.  I saw him only at rare intervals.  His chief
officer regularly fixed the positions I found reported on the chart,
and in such a way that I could exactly plot the Nautilus's course.</p>

<p id="id01321">Conseil and Land spent the long hours with me.  Conseil had told
his friend about the wonders of our undersea stroll, and the Canadian
was sorry he hadn't gone along.  But I hoped an opportunity would
arise for a visit to the forests of Oceania.</p>

<p id="id01322">Almost every day the panels in the lounge were open for some hours,
and our eyes never tired of probing the mysteries of the underwater world.</p>

<p id="id01323">The Nautilus's general heading was southeast, and it stayed at a depth
between 100 and 150 meters.  However, from lord-knows-what whim,
one day it did a diagonal dive by means of its slanting fins,
reaching strata located 2,000 meters underwater.  The thermometer
indicated a temperature of 4.25 degrees centigrade, which at this
depth seemed to be a temperature common to all latitudes.</p>

<p id="id01324">On November 26, at three o'clock in the morning, the Nautilus
cleared the Tropic of Cancer at longitude 172 degrees.  On the 27th
it passed in sight of the Hawaiian Islands, where the famous
Captain Cook met his death on February 14, 1779.  By then we
had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point.  When I arrived
on the platform that morning, I saw the Island of Hawaii two miles
to leeward, the largest of the seven islands making up this group.
I could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts,
the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline,
and its volcanoes, crowned by Mauna Kea, whose elevation is 5,000
meters above sea level.  Among other specimens from these waterways,
our nets brought up some peacock-tailed flabellarian coral,
polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part
of the ocean.</p>

<p id="id01325">The Nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading.  On December 1
it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees, and on the 4th
of the same month, after a quick crossing marked by no incident,
we raised the Marquesas Islands.  Three miles off, in latitude 8
degrees 57' south and longitude 139 degrees 32' west, I spotted
Martin Point on Nuku Hiva, chief member of this island group
that belongs to France.  I could make out only its wooded mountains
on the horizon, because Captain Nemo hated to hug shore.
There our nets brought up some fine fish samples:  dolphinfish with
azure fins, gold tails, and flesh that's unrivaled in the entire world,
wrasse from the genus Hologymnosus that were nearly denuded
of scales but exquisite in flavor, knifejaws with bony beaks,
yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito, all fish worth
classifying in the ship's pantry.</p>

<p id="id01326">After leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the French
flag, the Nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from December 4 to the 11th.
Its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school
of squid, unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish.
French fishermen give them the name "cuckoldfish," and they
belong to the class Cephalopoda, family Dibranchiata,
consisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts.
The naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them,
and these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox
orators in the Greek marketplace, as well as excellent dishes
for the tables of rich citizens, if we're to believe Athenaeus,
a Greek physician predating Galen.</p>

<p id="id01327">It was during the night of December 9-10 that the Nautilus encountered
this army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks.  They numbered in
the millions.  They were migrating from the temperate zones toward
zones still warmer, following the itineraries of herring and sardines.
We stared at them through our thick glass windows:  they swam backward
with tremendous speed, moving by means of their locomotive tubes,
chasing fish and mollusks, eating the little ones, eaten by the big ones,
and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature
has rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic snakes.
Despite its speed, the Nautilus navigated for several hours
in the midst of this school of animals, and its nets brought up
an incalculable number, among which I recognized all nine species
that Professor Orbigny has classified as native to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p id="id01328">During this crossing, the sea continually lavished us
with the most marvelous sights.  Its variety was infinite.
It changed its setting and decor for the mere pleasure of our eyes,
and we were called upon not simply to contemplate the works of our
Creator in the midst of the liquid element, but also to probe
the ocean's most daunting mysteries.</p>

<p id="id01329">During the day of December 11, I was busy reading in the main lounge.
Ned Land and Conseil were observing the luminous waters
through the gaping panels.  The Nautilus was motionless.
Its ballast tanks full, it was sitting at a depth of 1,000 meters
in a comparatively unpopulated region of the ocean where only larger
fish put in occasional appearances.</p>

<p id="id01330">Just then I was studying a delightful book by Jean Mac&#233;, The Servants
of the Stomach, and savoring its ingenious teachings, when Conseil
interrupted my reading.</p>

<p id="id01331">"Would master kindly come here for an instant?" he said to me
in an odd voice.</p>

<p id="id01332">"What is it, Conseil?"</p>

<p id="id01333">"It's something that master should see."</p>

<p id="id01334">I stood up, went, leaned on my elbows before the window, and I saw it.</p>

<p id="id01335">In the broad electric daylight, an enormous black mass, quite motionless,
hung suspended in the midst of the waters.  I observed it carefully,
trying to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean.
Then a sudden thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p id="id01336">"A ship!"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01337">"Yes," the Canadian replied, "a disabled craft that's
sinking straight down!"</p>

<p id="id01338">Ned Land was not mistaken.  We were in the presence of a ship whose
severed shrouds still hung from their clasps.  Its hull looked in
good condition, and it must have gone under only a few hours before.
The stumps of three masts, chopped off two feet above the deck,
indicated a flooding ship that had been forced to sacrifice its masting.
But it had heeled sideways, filling completely, and it was listing
to port even yet.  A sorry sight, this carcass lost under the waves,
but sorrier still was the sight on its deck, where, lashed with ropes
to prevent their being washed overboard, some human corpses still lay!
I counted four of them&#8212;four men, one still standing at the helm&#8212;
then a woman, halfway out of a skylight on the afterdeck,
holding a child in her arms.  This woman was young.
Under the brilliant lighting of the Nautilus's rays, I could
make out her features, which the water hadn't yet decomposed.
With a supreme effort, she had lifted her child above her head,
and the poor little creature's arms were still twined around its
mother's neck!  The postures of the four seamen seemed ghastly to me,
twisted from convulsive movements, as if making a last effort
to break loose from the ropes that bound them to their ship.
And the helmsman, standing alone, calmer, his face smooth and serious,
his grizzled hair plastered to his brow, his hands clutching the wheel,
seemed even yet to be guiding his wrecked three-master through
the ocean depths!</p>

<p id="id01339">What a scene!  We stood dumbstruck, hearts pounding, before this
shipwreck caught in the act, as if it had been photographed in its
final moments, so to speak!  And already I could see enormous sharks
moving in, eyes ablaze, drawn by the lure of human flesh!</p>

<p id="id01340">Meanwhile, turning, the Nautilus made a circle around the sinking ship,
and for an instant I could read the board on its stern:</p>

<p id="id01341">The Florida</p>

<p id="id01342">Sunderland, England</p>

<h2 id="id01343">CHAPTER 19</h2>

<h6 id="id01344">Vanikoro</h6>

<p id="id01345">THIS DREADFUL SIGHT was the first of a whole series of maritime
catastrophes that the Nautilus would encounter on its run.
When it plied more heavily traveled seas, we often saw wrecked hulls
rotting in midwater, and farther down, cannons, shells, anchors, chains,
and a thousand other iron objects rusting away.</p>

<p id="id01346">Meanwhile, continuously swept along by the Nautilus, where we lived
in near isolation, we raised the Tuamotu Islands on December 11,
that old "dangerous group" associated with the French global
navigator Commander Bougainville; it stretches from Ducie Island
to Lazareff Island over an area of 500 leagues from the east-southeast
to the west-northwest, between latitude 13 degrees 30'
and 23 degrees 50' south, and between longitude 125 degrees 30'
and 151 degrees 30' west.  This island group covers a surface area
of 370 square leagues, and it's made up of some sixty subgroups,
among which we noted the Gambier group, which is a French protectorate.
These islands are coral formations.  Thanks to the work of polyps, a slow
but steady upheaval will someday connect these islands to each other.
Later on, this new island will be fused to its neighboring island groups,
and a fifth continent will stretch from New Zealand and New Caledonia
as far as the Marquesas Islands.</p>

<p id="id01347">The day I expounded this theory to Captain Nemo, he answered me coldly:</p>

<p id="id01348">"The earth doesn't need new continents, but new men!"</p>

<p id="id01349">Sailors' luck led the Nautilus straight to Reao Island, one of the most
unusual in this group, which was discovered in 1822 by Captain Bell
aboard the Minerva.  So I was able to study the madreporic process
that has created the islands in this ocean.</p>

<p id="id01350">Madrepores, which one must guard against confusing with precious coral,
clothe their tissue in a limestone crust, and their variations in
structure have led my famous mentor Professor Milne-Edwards to classify
them into five divisions.  The tiny microscopic animals that secrete
this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells.
Their limestone deposits build up into rocks, reefs, islets, islands.
In some places, they form atolls, a circular ring surrounding
a lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with
the sea.  Elsewhere, they take the shape of barrier reefs,
such as those that exist along the coasts of New Caledonia
and several of the Tuamotu Islands.  In still other localities,
such as R&#233;union Island and the island of Mauritius, they build
fringing reefs, high, straight walls next to which the ocean's
depth is considerable.</p>

<p id="id01351">While cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning
of Reao Island, I marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished
by these microscopic laborers.  These walls were the express
achievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral,
finger coral, star coral, and stony coral.  These polyps grow
exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea,
and so it's in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures,
which sink little by little together with the secreted rubble
binding them.  This, at least, is the theory of Mr. Charles Darwin,
who thus explains the formation of atolls&#8212;a theory superior,
in my view, to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit
on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet
below sea level.</p>

<p id="id01352">I could observe these strange walls quite closely:  our sounding lines
indicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than 300 meters,
and our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle.</p>

<p id="id01353">In reply to a question Conseil asked me about the growth rate
of these colossal barriers, I thoroughly amazed him by saying
that scientists put it at an eighth of an inch per biennium.</p>

<p id="id01354">"Therefore," he said to me, "to build these walls, it took . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id01355">"192,000 years, my gallant Conseil, which significantly extends
the biblical Days of Creation.  What's more, the formation of coal&#8212;
in other words, the petrification of forests swallowed by floods&#8212;
and the cooling of basaltic rocks likewise call for a much longer
period of time.  I might add that those 'days' in the Bible
must represent whole epochs and not literally the lapse of time
between two sunrises, because according to the Bible itself,
the sun doesn't date from the first day of Creation."</p>

<p id="id01356">When the Nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean, I could take
in Reao Island over its whole flat, wooded expanse.  Obviously its
madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms.
One day, carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores,
some seed fell onto these limestone beds, mixing with decomposed
particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus.
Propelled by the waves, a coconut arrived on this new coast.
Its germ took root.  Its tree grew tall, catching steam off the water.
A brook was born.  Little by little, vegetation spread.
Tiny animals&#8212;worms, insects&#8212;rode ashore on tree trunks snatched
from islands to windward.  Turtles came to lay their eggs.
Birds nested in the young trees.  In this way animal life developed,
and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil, man appeared.
And that's how these islands were formed, the immense achievement
of microscopic animals.</p>

<p id="id01357">Near evening Reao Island melted into the distance, and the Nautilus
noticeably changed course.  After touching the Tropic of Capricorn
at longitude 135 degrees, it headed west-northwest, going back up
the whole intertropical zone.  Although the summer sun lavished
its rays on us, we never suffered from the heat, because thirty
or forty meters underwater, the temperature didn't go over 10
degrees to 12 degrees centigrade.</p>

<p id="id01358">By December 15 we had left the alluring Society Islands in the west,
likewise elegant Tahiti, queen of the Pacific.  In the morning
I spotted this island's lofty summits a few miles to leeward.
Its waters supplied excellent fish for the tables on board:
mackerel, bonito, albacore, and a few varieties of that sea serpent
named the moray eel.</p>

<p id="id01359">The Nautilus had cleared 8,100 miles.  We logged 9,720 miles
when we passed between the Tonga Islands, where crews from
the Argo, Port-au-Prince, and Duke of Portland had perished,
and the island group of Samoa, scene of the slaying of Captain
de Langle, friend of that long-lost navigator, the Count de
La P&#233;rouse. Then we raised the Fiji Islands, where savages
slaughtered sailors from the Union, as well as Captain Bureau,
commander of the Darling Josephine out of Nantes, France.</p>

<p id="id01360">Extending over an expanse of 100 leagues north to south, and over 90
leagues east to west, this island group lies between latitude 2
degrees and 6 degrees south, and between longitude 174 degrees and 179
degrees west.  It consists of a number of islands, islets, and reefs,
among which we noted the islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Kadavu.</p>

<p id="id01361">It was the Dutch navigator Tasman who discovered this group in 1643,
the same year the Italian physicist Torricelli invented the barometer
and King Louis XIV ascended the French throne.  I'll let the reader
decide which of these deeds was more beneficial to humanity.
Coming later, Captain Cook in 1774, Rear Admiral d'Entrecasteaux in 1793,
and finally Captain Dumont d'Urville in 1827, untangled the whole
chaotic geography of this island group.  The Nautilus drew near
Wailea Bay, an unlucky place for England's Captain Dillon, who was
the first to shed light on the longstanding mystery surrounding
the disappearance of ships under the Count de La P&#233;rouse.</p>

<p id="id01362">This bay, repeatedly dredged, furnished a huge supply of
excellent oysters.  As the Roman playwright Seneca recommended,
we opened them right at our table, then stuffed ourselves.
These mollusks belonged to the species known by name as Ostrea lamellosa,
whose members are quite common off Corsica.  This Wailea oysterbank
must have been extensive, and for certain, if they hadn't been
controlled by numerous natural checks, these clusters of shellfish
would have ended up jam-packing the bay, since as many as 2,000,000
eggs have been counted in a single individual.</p>

<p id="id01363">And if Mr. Ned Land did not repent of his gluttony at our oyster fest,
it's because oysters are the only dish that never causes indigestion.
In fact, it takes no less than sixteen dozen of these headless
mollusks to supply the 315 grams that satisfy one man's minimum
daily requirement for nitrogen.</p>

<p id="id01364">On December 25 the Nautilus navigated amid the island group
of the New Hebrides, which the Portuguese seafarer Queir&#243;s
discovered in 1606, which Commander Bougainville explored in 1768,
and to which Captain Cook gave its current name in 1773.
This group is chiefly made up of nine large islands and forms a
120-league strip from the north-northwest to the south-southeast, lying
between latitude 2 degrees and 15 degrees south, and between longitude
164 degrees and 168 degrees. At the moment of our noon sights,
we passed fairly close to the island of Aurou, which looked to me
like a mass of green woods crowned by a peak of great height.</p>

<p id="id01365">That day it was yuletide, and it struck me that Ned Land badly
missed celebrating "Christmas," that genuine family holiday where
Protestants are such zealots.</p>

<p id="id01366">I hadn't seen Captain Nemo for over a week, when, on the morning
of the 27th, he entered the main lounge, as usual acting as if he'd
been gone for just five minutes.  I was busy tracing the Nautilus's
course on the world map.  The captain approached, placed a finger
over a position on the chart, and pronounced just one word:</p>

<p id="id01367">"Vanikoro."</p>

<p id="id01368">This name was magic!  It was the name of those islets
where vessels under the Count de La P&#233;rouse had miscarried.
I straightened suddenly.</p>

<p id="id01369">"The Nautilus is bringing us to Vanikoro?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id01370">"Yes, professor," the captain replied.</p>

<p id="id01371">"And I'll be able to visit those famous islands where the Compass
and the Astrolabe came to grief?"</p>

<p id="id01372">"If you like, professor."</p>

<p id="id01373">"When will we reach Vanikoro?"</p>

<p id="id01374">"We already have, professor."</p>

<p id="id01375">Followed by Captain Nemo, I climbed onto the platform, and from there
my eyes eagerly scanned the horizon.</p>

<p id="id01376">In the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size,
surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles.
We were facing the island of Vanikoro proper, to which
Captain Dumont d'Urville had given the name "Island of the Search";
we lay right in front of the little harbor of Vana, located in latitude
16 degrees 4' south and longitude 164 degrees 32' east.  Its shores
seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland,
crowned by Mt.  Kapogo, which is 476 fathoms high.</p>

<p id="id01377">After clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway,
the Nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty
to forty fathoms.  Under the green shade of some tropical evergreens,
I spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach.
In this long, blackish object advancing flush with the water,
didn't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged
to view with distrust?</p>

<p id="id01378">Just then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the shipwreck
of the Count de La P&#233;rouse.</p>

<p id="id01379">"What everybody knows, captain," I answered him.</p>

<p id="id01380">"And could you kindly tell me what everybody knows?" he asked me
in a gently ironic tone.</p>

<p id="id01381">"Very easily."</p>

<p id="id01382">I related to him what the final deeds of Captain Dumont d'Urville
had brought to light, deeds described here in this heavily condensed
summary of the whole matter.</p>

<p id="id01383">In 1785 the Count de La P&#233;rouse and his subordinate, Captain de Langle,
were sent by King Louis XVI of France on a voyage to circumnavigate
the globe.  They boarded two sloops of war, the Compass and the Astrolabe,
which were never seen again.</p>

<p id="id01384">In 1791, justly concerned about the fate of these two sloops
of war, the French government fitted out two large cargo boats,
the Search and the Hope, which left Brest on September 28 under
orders from Rear Admiral Bruni d'Entrecasteaux. Two months later,
testimony from a certain Commander Bowen, aboard the Albemarle,
alleged that rubble from shipwrecked vessels had been seen
on the coast of New Georgia.  But d'Entrecasteaux was unaware
of this news&#8212;which seemed a bit dubious anyhow&#8212;and headed toward
the Admiralty Islands, which had been named in a report by one
Captain Hunter as the site of the Count de La P&#233;rouse's shipwreck.</p>

<p id="id01385">They looked in vain.  The Hope and the Search passed right
by Vanikoro without stopping there; and overall, this voyage
was plagued by misfortune, ultimately costing the lives of
Rear Admiral d'Entrecasteaux, two of his subordinate officers,
and several seamen from his crew.</p>

<p id="id01386">It was an old hand at the Pacific, the English adventurer
Captain Peter Dillon, who was the first to pick up the trail left
by castaways from the wrecked vessels.  On May 15, 1824, his ship,
the St. Patrick, passed by Tikopia Island, one of the New Hebrides.
There a native boatman pulled alongside in a dugout canoe and sold
Dillon a silver sword hilt bearing the imprint of characters engraved
with a cutting tool known as a burin.  Furthermore, this native
boatman claimed that during a stay in Vanikoro six years earlier,
he had seen two Europeans belonging to ships that had run aground
on the island's reefs many years before.</p>

<p id="id01387">Dillon guessed that the ships at issue were those under the Count de
La P&#233;rouse, ships whose disappearance had shaken the entire world.
He tried to reach Vanikoro, where, according to the native boatman,
a good deal of rubble from the shipwreck could still be found,
but winds and currents prevented his doing so.</p>

<p id="id01388">Dillon returned to Calcutta.  There he was able to interest
the Asiatic Society and the East India Company in his discovery.
A ship named after the Search was placed at his disposal,
and he departed on January 23, 1827, accompanied by a French deputy.</p>

<p id="id01389">This new Search, after putting in at several stops over the Pacific,
dropped anchor before Vanikoro on July 7, 1827, in the same harbor
of Vana where the Nautilus was currently floating.</p>

<p id="id01390">There Dillon collected many relics of the shipwreck:
iron utensils, anchors, eyelets from pulleys, swivel guns,
an eighteen-pound shell, the remains of some astronomical instruments,
a piece of sternrail, and a bronze bell bearing the inscription
"Made by Bazin," the foundry mark at Brest Arsenal around 1785.
There could no longer be any doubt.</p>

<p id="id01391">Finishing his investigations, Dillon stayed at the site of
the casualty until the month of October.  Then he left Vanikoro,
headed toward New Zealand, dropped anchor at Calcutta on April 7,
1828, and returned to France, where he received a very cordial
welcome from King Charles X.</p>

<p id="id01392">But just then the renowned French explorer Captain Dumont d'Urville,
unaware of Dillon's activities, had already set sail to search
elsewhere for the site of the shipwreck.  In essence, a whaling
vessel had reported that some medals and a Cross of St. Louis
had been found in the hands of savages in the Louisiade Islands
and New Caledonia.</p>

<p id="id01393">So Captain Dumont d'Urville had put to sea in command of a vessel
named after the Astrolabe, and just two months after Dillon had
left Vanikoro, Dumont d'Urville dropped anchor before Hobart.  There he
heard about Dillon's findings, and he further learned that a
certain James Hobbs, chief officer on the Union out of Calcutta,
had put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18'
south and longitude 156 degrees 30' east, and had noted the natives
of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics.</p>

<p id="id01394">Pretty perplexed, Dumont d'Urville didn't know if he should give
credence to these reports, which had been carried in some of
the less reliable newspapers; nevertheless, he decided to start
on Dillon's trail.</p>

<p id="id01395">On February 10, 1828, the new Astrolabe hove before Tikopia Island,
took on a guide and interpreter in the person of a deserter who had
settled there, plied a course toward Vanikoro, raised it on February 12,
sailed along its reefs until the 14th, and only on the 20th dropped
anchor inside its barrier in the harbor of Vana.</p>

<p id="id01396">On the 23rd, several officers circled the island and brought back some
rubble of little importance.  The natives, adopting a system of denial
and evasion, refused to guide them to the site of the casualty.
This rather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives
had mistreated the castaways; and in truth, the natives seemed afraid
that Dumont d'Urville had come to avenge the Count de La P&#233;rouse
and his unfortunate companions.</p>

<p id="id01397">But on the 26th, appeased with gifts and seeing that they didn't
need to fear any reprisals, the natives led the chief officer,
Mr. Jacquinot, to the site of the shipwreck.</p>

<p id="id01398">At this location, in three or four fathoms of water between the Paeu
and Vana reefs, there lay some anchors, cannons, and ingots
of iron and lead, all caked with limestone concretions.  A launch
and whaleboat from the new Astrolabe were steered to this locality,
and after going to exhausting lengths, their crews managed to dredge
up an anchor weighing 1,800 pounds, a cast-iron eight-pounder cannon,
a lead ingot, and two copper swivel guns.</p>

<p id="id01399">Questioning the natives, Captain Dumont d'Urville also learned that
after La P&#233;rouse's two ships had miscarried on the island's reefs,
the count had built a smaller craft, only to go off and miscarry
a second time.  Where?  Nobody knew.</p>

<p id="id01400">The commander of the new Astrolabe then had a monument erected under a
tuft of mangrove, in memory of the famous navigator and his companions.
It was a simple quadrangular pyramid, set on a coral base,
with no ironwork to tempt the natives' avarice.</p>

<p id="id01401">Then Dumont d'Urville tried to depart; but his crews were run down from
the fevers raging on these unsanitary shores, and quite ill himself,
he was unable to weigh anchor until March 17.</p>

<p id="id01402">Meanwhile, fearing that Dumont d'Urville wasn't abreast of
Dillon's activities, the French government sent a sloop of war
to Vanikoro, the Bayonnaise under Commander Legoarant de Tromelin,
who had been stationed on the American west coast.  Dropping anchor
before Vanikoro a few months after the new Astrolabe's departure,
the Bayonnaise didn't find any additional evidence but verified
that the savages hadn't disturbed the memorial honoring the Count
de La P&#233;rouse.</p>

<p id="id01403">This is the substance of the account I gave Captain Nemo.</p>

<p id="id01404">"So," he said to me, "the castaways built a third ship on Vanikoro Island,
and to this day, nobody knows where it went and perished?"</p>

<p id="id01405">"Nobody knows."</p>

<p id="id01406">Captain Nemo didn't reply but signaled me to follow him to the
main lounge.  The Nautilus sank a few meters beneath the waves,
and the panels opened.</p>

<p id="id01407">I rushed to the window and saw crusts of coral:  fungus coral,
siphonula coral, alcyon coral, sea anemone from the genus Caryophylia,
plus myriads of charming fish including greenfish, damselfish,
sweepers, snappers, and squirrelfish; underneath this coral covering
I detected some rubble the old dredges hadn't been able to tear free&#8212;
iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, shells, tackle from a capstan,
a stempost, all objects hailing from the wrecked ships and now
carpeted in moving flowers.</p>

<p id="id01408">And as I stared at this desolate wreckage, Captain Nemo told me
in a solemn voice:</p>

<p id="id01409">"Commander La P&#233;rouse set out on December 7, 1785, with his ships,
the Compass and the Astrolabe.  He dropped anchor first at Botany Bay,
visited the Tonga Islands and New Caledonia, headed toward
the Santa Cruz Islands, and put in at Nomuka, one of the islands
in the Ha'apai group.  Then his ships arrived at the unknown reefs
of Vanikoro.  Traveling in the lead, the Compass ran afoul of breakers
on the southerly coast.  The Astrolabe went to its rescue and also
ran aground.  The first ship was destroyed almost immediately.
The second, stranded to leeward, held up for some days.
The natives gave the castaways a fair enough welcome.
The latter took up residence on the island and built a smaller
craft with rubble from the two large ones.  A few seamen stayed
voluntarily in Vanikoro.  The others, weak and ailing, set sail
with the Count de La P&#233;rouse. They headed to the Solomon Islands,
and they perished with all hands on the westerly coast of the chief
island in that group, between Cape Deception and Cape Satisfaction!"</p>

<p id="id01410">"And how do you know all this?"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01411">"Here's what I found at the very site of that final shipwreck!"</p>

<p id="id01412">Captain Nemo showed me a tin box, stamped with the coat of arms
of France and all corroded by salt water.  He opened it and I saw
a bundle of papers, yellowed but still legible.</p>

<p id="id01413">They were the actual military orders given by France's Minister
of the Navy to Commander La P&#233;rouse, with notes along the margin
in the handwriting of King Louis XVI!</p>

<p id="id01414">"Ah, what a splendid death for a seaman!"  Captain Nemo then said.
"A coral grave is a tranquil grave, and may Heaven grant that my
companions and I rest in no other!"</p>

<h2 id="id01415">CHAPTER 20</h2>

<h6 id="id01416">The Torres Strait</h6>

<p id="id01417">DURING THE NIGHT of December 27-28, the Nautilus left
the waterways of Vanikoro behind with extraordinary speed.
Its heading was southwesterly, and in three days it had cleared the 750
leagues that separated La P&#233;rouse's islands from the southeastern
tip of Papua.</p>

<p id="id01418">On January 1, 1868, bright and early, Conseil joined me on the platform.</p>

<p id="id01419">"Will master," the gallant lad said to me, "allow me to wish him
a happy new year?"</p>

<p id="id01420">"Good heavens, Conseil, it's just like old times in my office
at the Botanical Gardens in Paris!  I accept your kind wishes
and I thank you for them.  Only, I'd like to know what you mean
by a 'happy year' under the circumstances in which we're placed.
Is it a year that will bring our imprisonment to an end, or a year
that will see this strange voyage continue?"</p>

<p id="id01421">"Ye gods," Conseil replied, "I hardly know what to tell master.
We're certainly seeing some unusual things, and for two months
we've had no time for boredom.  The latest wonder is always
the most astonishing, and if this progression keeps up, I can't
imagine what its climax will be.  In my opinion, we'll never again
have such an opportunity."</p>

<p id="id01422">"Never, Conseil."</p>

<p id="id01423">"Besides, Mr. Nemo really lives up to his Latin name, since he couldn't
be less in the way if he didn't exist."</p>

<p id="id01424">"True enough, Conseil."</p>

<p id="id01425">"Therefore, with all due respect to master, I think a 'happy year'
would be a year that lets us see everything&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id01426">"Everything, Conseil?  No year could be that long.  But what does<br>

Ned Land think about all this?"<br></p>

<p id="id01427">"Ned Land's thoughts are exactly the opposite of mine,"<br>

Conseil replied.  "He has a practical mind and a demanding stomach.<br>

He's tired of staring at fish and eating them day in and day out.<br>

This shortage of wine, bread, and meat isn't suitable for an upstanding<br>

Anglo-Saxon, a man accustomed to beefsteak and unfazed by regular<br>

doses of brandy or gin!"<br></p>

<p id="id01428">"For my part, Conseil, that doesn't bother me in the least,
and I've adjusted very nicely to the diet on board."</p>

<p id="id01429">"So have I," Conseil replied.  "Accordingly, I think as much about
staying as Mr. Land about making his escape.  Thus, if this new year
isn't a happy one for me, it will be for him, and vice versa.
No matter what happens, one of us will be pleased.  So, in conclusion,
I wish master to have whatever his heart desires."</p>

<p id="id01430">"Thank you, Conseil.  Only I must ask you to postpone the question of new
year's gifts, and temporarily accept a hearty handshake in their place.
That's all I have on me."</p>

<p id="id01431">"Master has never been more generous," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id01432">And with that, the gallant lad went away.</p>

<p id="id01433">By January 2 we had fared 11,340 miles, hence 5,250 leagues,
from our starting point in the seas of Japan.  Before the Nautilus's
spur there stretched the dangerous waterways of the Coral Sea,
off the northeast coast of Australia.  Our boat cruised along a few
miles away from that daunting shoal where Captain Cook's ships
wellnigh miscarried on June 10, 1770.  The craft that Cook was aboard
charged into some coral rock, and if his vessel didn't go down,
it was thanks to the circumstance that a piece of coral broke off
in the collision and plugged the very hole it had made in the hull.</p>

<p id="id01434">I would have been deeply interested in visiting this long,
360-league reef, against which the ever-surging sea broke
with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps.  But just then
the Nautilus's slanting fins took us to great depths, and I could
see nothing of those high coral walls.  I had to rest content
with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets.
Among others I noted some long-finned albacore, a species in the
genus Scomber, as big as tuna, bluish on the flanks, and streaked
with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies.
These fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very
dainty flesh.  We also caught a large number of yellow-green gilthead,
half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado, plus some
flying gurnards, authentic underwater swallows that, on dark nights,
alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers.
Among mollusks and zoophytes, I found in our trawl's meshes
various species of alcyonarian coral, sea urchins, hammer shells,
spurred-star shells, wentletrap snails, horn shells, glass snails.
The local flora was represented by fine floating algae:
sea tangle, and kelp from the genus Macrocystis, saturated with
the mucilage their pores perspire, from which I selected a wonderful
Nemastoma geliniaroidea, classifying it with the natural curiosities
in the museum.</p>

<p id="id01435">On January 4, two days after crossing the Coral Sea, we raised the coast
of Papua.  On this occasion Captain Nemo told me that he intended
to reach the Indian Ocean via the Torres Strait.  This was the extent
of his remarks.  Ned saw with pleasure that this course would bring us,
once again, closer to European seas.</p>

<p id="id01436">The Torres Strait is regarded as no less dangerous for its
bristling reefs than for the savage inhabitants of its coasts.
It separates Queensland from the huge island of Papua,
also called New Guinea.</p>

<p id="id01437">Papua is 400 leagues long by 130 leagues wide, with a surface area of
40,000 geographic leagues.  It's located between latitude 0 degrees 19'
and 10 degrees 2' south, and between longitude 128 degrees 23'
and 146 degrees 15'. At noon, while the chief officer was taking
the sun's altitude, I spotted the summits of the Arfak Mountains,
rising in terraces and ending in sharp peaks.</p>

<p id="id01438">Discovered in 1511 by the Portuguese Francisco Serrano, these shores
were successively visited by Don Jorge de Meneses in 1526, by Juan
de Grijalva in 1527, by the Spanish general Alvaro de Saavedra
in 1528, by Inigo Ortiz in 1545, by the Dutchman Schouten in 1616,
by Nicolas Sruick in 1753, by Tasman, Dampier, Fumel, Carteret,
Edwards, Bougainville, Cook, McClure, and Thomas Forrest,
by Rear Admiral d'Entrecasteaux in 1792, by Louis-Isidore Duperrey
in 1823, and by Captain Dumont d'Urville in 1827.  "It's the heartland
of the blacks who occupy all Malaysia," Mr. de Rienzi has said;
and I hadn't the foggiest inkling that sailors' luck was about
to bring me face to face with these daunting Andaman aborigines.</p>

<p id="id01439">So the Nautilus hove before the entrance to the world's
most dangerous strait, a passageway that even the boldest
navigators hesitated to clear:  the strait that Luis Vaez de
Torres faced on returning from the South Seas in Melanesia,
the strait in which sloops of war under Captain Dumont d'Urville
ran aground in 1840 and nearly miscarried with all hands.
And even the Nautilus, rising superior to every danger in the sea,
was about to become intimate with its coral reefs.</p>

<p id="id01440">The Torres Strait is about thirty-four leagues wide, but it's obstructed
by an incalculable number of islands, islets, breakers, and rocks
that make it nearly impossible to navigate.  Consequently, Captain Nemo
took every desired precaution in crossing it.  Floating flush
with the water, the Nautilus moved ahead at a moderate pace.
Like a cetacean's tail, its propeller churned the waves slowly.</p>

<p id="id01441">Taking advantage of this situation, my two companions and I found seats
on the ever-deserted platform.  In front of us stood the pilothouse,
and unless I'm extremely mistaken, Captain Nemo must have been inside,
steering his Nautilus himself.</p>

<p id="id01442">Under my eyes I had the excellent charts of the Torres Strait
that had been surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer
Vincendon Dumoulin and Sublieutenant (now Admiral) Coupvent-Desbois, who
were part of Dumont d'Urville's general staff during his final
voyage to circumnavigate the globe.  These, along with the efforts
of Captain King, are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this
narrow passageway, and I consulted them with scrupulous care.</p>

<p id="id01443">Around the Nautilus the sea was boiling furiously.  A stream of waves,
bearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half
miles per hour, broke over heads of coral emerging here and there.</p>

<p id="id01444">"That's one rough sea!"  Ned Land told me.</p>

<p id="id01445">"Abominable indeed," I replied, "and hardly suitable for a craft
like the Nautilus."</p>

<p id="id01446">"That damned captain," the Canadian went on, "must really be sure
of his course, because if these clumps of coral so much as brush us,
they'll rip our hull into a thousand pieces!"</p>

<p id="id01447">The situation was indeed dangerous, but as if by magic, the Nautilus
seemed to glide right down the middle of these rampaging reefs.
It didn't follow the exact course of the Zealous and the new Astrolabe,
which had proved so ill-fated for Captain Dumont d'Urville. It went
more to the north, hugged the Murray Islands, and returned to the
southwest near Cumberland Passage.  I thought it was about to charge
wholeheartedly into this opening, but it went up to the northwest,
through a large number of little-known islands and islets,
and steered toward Tound Island and the Bad Channel.</p>

<p id="id01448">I was already wondering if Captain Nemo, rash to the point
of sheer insanity, wanted his ship to tackle the narrows
where Dumont d'Urville's two sloops of war had gone aground,
when he changed direction a second time and cut straight to the west,
heading toward Gueboroa Island.</p>

<p id="id01449">By then it was three o'clock in the afternoon.  The current was slacking
off, it was almost full tide.  The Nautilus drew near this island,
which I can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of screw pines.
We hugged it from less than two miles out.</p>

<p id="id01450">A sudden jolt threw me down.  The Nautilus had just struck a reef,
and it remained motionless, listing slightly to port.</p>

<p id="id01451">When I stood up, I saw Captain Nemo and his chief officer on
the platform.  They were examining the ship's circumstances,
exchanging a few words in their incomprehensible dialect.</p>

<p id="id01452">Here is what those circumstances entailed.  Two miles to starboard lay
Gueboroa Island, its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm.
To the south and east, heads of coral were already on display,
left uncovered by the ebbing waters.  We had run aground at full tide
and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate, an inconvenient
state of affairs for floating the Nautilus off.  However, the ship
hadn't suffered in any way, so solidly joined was its hull.
But although it could neither sink nor split open, it was in serious
danger of being permanently attached to these reefs, and that would
have been the finish of Captain Nemo's submersible.</p>

<p id="id01453">I was mulling this over when the captain approached, cool and calm,
forever in control of himself, looking neither alarmed nor annoyed.</p>

<p id="id01454">"An accident?"  I said to him.</p>

<p id="id01455">"No, an incident," he answered me.</p>

<p id="id01456">"But an incident," I replied, "that may oblige you to become
a resident again of these shores you avoid!"</p>

<p id="id01457">Captain Nemo gave me an odd look and gestured no.  Which told
me pretty clearly that nothing would ever force him to set foot
on a land mass again.  Then he said:</p>

<p id="id01458">"No, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus isn't consigned to perdition.<br>

It will still carry you through the midst of the ocean's wonders.<br>

Our voyage is just beginning, and I've no desire to deprive myself<br>

so soon of the pleasure of your company."<br></p>

<p id="id01459">"Even so, Captain Nemo," I went on, ignoring his ironic turn of phrase,
"the Nautilus has run aground at a moment when the sea is full.
Now then, the tides aren't strong in the Pacific, and if you can't
unballast the Nautilus, which seems impossible to me, I don't see
how it will float off."</p>

<p id="id01460">"You're right, professor, the Pacific tides aren't strong,"
Captain Nemo replied.  "But in the Torres Strait, one still finds
a meter-and-a-half difference in level between high and low seas.
Today is January 4, and in five days the moon will be full.
Now then, I'll be quite astonished if that good-natured satellite
doesn't sufficiently raise these masses of water and do me a favor
for which I'll be forever grateful."</p>

<p id="id01461">This said, Captain Nemo went below again to the Nautilus's interior,
followed by his chief officer.  As for our craft, it no longer stirred,
staying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled
it in with their indestructible cement.</p>

<p id="id01462">"Well, sir?"  Ned Land said to me, coming up after
the captain's departure.</p>

<p id="id01463">"Well, Ned my friend, we'll serenely wait for the tide on the 9th,
because it seems the moon will have the good nature to float us away!"</p>

<p id="id01464">"As simple as that?"</p>

<p id="id01465">"As simple as that."</p>

<p id="id01466">"So our captain isn't going to drop his anchors, put his engines
on the chains, and do anything to haul us off?"</p>

<p id="id01467">"Since the tide will be sufficient," Conseil replied simply.</p>

<p id="id01468">The Canadian stared at Conseil, then he shrugged his shoulders.<br>

The seaman in him was talking now.<br></p>

<p id="id01469">"Sir," he answered, "you can trust me when I say this hunk
of iron will never navigate again, on the seas or under them.
It's only fit to be sold for its weight.  So I think it's time
we gave Captain Nemo the slip."</p>

<p id="id01470">"Ned my friend," I replied, "unlike you, I haven't given up on
our valiant Nautilus, and in four days we'll know where we stand
on these Pacific tides.  Besides, an escape attempt might be
timely if we were in sight of the coasts of England or Provence,
but in the waterways of Papua it's another story.  And we'll always
have that as a last resort if the Nautilus doesn't right itself,
which I'd regard as a real calamity."</p>

<p id="id01471">"But couldn't we at least get the lay of the land?"  Ned went on.<br>

"Here's an island.  On this island there are trees.<br>

Under those trees land animals loaded with cutlets and roast beef,<br>

which I'd be happy to sink my teeth into."<br></p>

<p id="id01472">"In this instance our friend Ned is right," Conseil said, "and I side
with his views.  Couldn't master persuade his friend Captain Nemo
to send the three of us ashore, if only so our feet don't lose
the knack of treading on the solid parts of our planet?"</p>

<p id="id01473">"I can ask him," I replied, "but he'll refuse."</p>

<p id="id01474">"Let master take the risk," Conseil said, "and we'll know where we
stand on the captain's affability."</p>

<p id="id01475">Much to my surprise, Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for,
and he did so with grace and alacrity, not even exacting my promise
to return on board.  But fleeing across the New Guinea territories would
be extremely dangerous, and I wouldn't have advised Ned Land to try it.
Better to be prisoners aboard the Nautilus than to fall into the hands
of Papuan natives.</p>

<p id="id01476">The skiff was put at our disposal for the next morning.
I hardly needed to ask whether Captain Nemo would be coming along.
I likewise assumed that no crewmen would be assigned to us,
that Ned Land would be in sole charge of piloting the longboat.
Besides, the shore lay no more than two miles off, and it would
be child's play for the Canadian to guide that nimble skiff through
those rows of reefs so ill-fated for big ships.</p>

<p id="id01477">The next day, January 5, after its deck paneling was opened,
the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea from
the top of the platform.  Two men were sufficient for this operation.
The oars were inside the longboat and we had only to take our seats.</p>

<p id="id01478">At eight o'clock, armed with rifles and axes, we pulled clear
of the Nautilus.  The sea was fairly calm.  A mild breeze blew
from shore.  In place by the oars, Conseil and I rowed vigorously,
and Ned steered us into the narrow lanes between the breakers.
The skiff handled easily and sped swiftly.</p>

<p id="id01479">Ned Land couldn't conceal his glee.  He was a prisoner escaping
from prison and never dreaming he would need to reenter it.</p>

<p id="id01480">"Meat!" he kept repeating.  "Now we'll eat red meat!  Actual game!
A real mess call, by thunder!  I'm not saying fish aren't good for you,
but we mustn't overdo 'em, and a slice of fresh venison grilled
over live coals will be a nice change from our standard fare."</p>

<p id="id01481">"You glutton," Conseil replied, "you're making my mouth water!"</p>

<p id="id01482">"It remains to be seen," I said, "whether these forests do contain game,
and if the types of game aren't of such size that they can
hunt the hunter."</p>

<p id="id01483">"Fine, Professor Aronnax!" replied the Canadian, whose teeth seemed
to be as honed as the edge of an ax.  "But if there's no other
quadruped on this island, I'll eat tiger&#8212;tiger sirloin."</p>

<p id="id01484">"Our friend Ned grows disturbing," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id01485">"Whatever it is," Ned Land went on, "any animal having four feet
without feathers, or two feet with feathers, will be greeted by my
very own one-gun salute."</p>

<p id="id01486">"Oh good!"  I replied.  "The reckless Mr. Land is at it again!"</p>

<p id="id01487">"Don't worry, Professor Aronnax, just keep rowing!" the Canadian replied.
"I only need twenty-five minutes to serve you one of my
own special creations."</p>

<p id="id01488">By 8:30 the Nautilus's skiff had just run gently aground on
a sandy strand, after successfully clearing the ring of coral
that surrounds Gueboroa Island.</p>
