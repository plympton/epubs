<h6 id="id02265">The Red Sea</h6>

<p id="id02266">DURING THE DAY of January 29, the island of Ceylon disappeared
below the horizon, and at a speed of twenty miles per hour,
the Nautilus glided into the labyrinthine channels that separate
the Maldive and Laccadive Islands.  It likewise hugged Kiltan Island,
a shore of madreporic origin discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499 and
one of nineteen chief islands in the island group of the Laccadives,
located between latitude 10 degrees and 14 degrees 30' north, and between
longitude 50 degrees 72' and 69 degrees east.</p>

<p id="id02267">By then we had fared 16,220 miles, or 7,500 leagues, from our starting
point in the seas of Japan.</p>

<p id="id02268">The next day, January 30, when the Nautilus rose to the surface
of the ocean, there was no more land in sight.  Setting its course
to the north-northwest, the ship headed toward the Gulf of Oman,
carved out between Arabia and the Indian peninsula and providing
access to the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p id="id02269">This was obviously a blind alley with no possible outlet.<br/>

So where was Captain Nemo taking us?  I was unable to say.<br/>

Which didn't satisfy the Canadian, who that day asked me where<br/>

we were going.<br/></p>

<p id="id02270">"We're going, Mr. Ned, where the captain's fancy takes us."</p>

<p id="id02271">"His fancy," the Canadian replied, "won't take us very far.
The Persian Gulf has no outlet, and if we enter those waters,
it won't be long before we return in our tracks."</p>

<p id="id02272">"All right, we'll return, Mr. Land, and after the Persian Gulf,
if the Nautilus wants to visit the Red Sea, the Strait of Bab el
Mandeb is still there to let us in!"</p>

<p id="id02273">"I don't have to tell you, sir," Ned Land replied, "that the Red Sea
is just as landlocked as the gulf, since the Isthmus of Suez hasn't
been cut all the way through yet; and even if it was, a boat
as secretive as ours wouldn't risk a canal intersected with locks.
So the Red Sea won't be our way back to Europe either."</p>

<p id="id02274">"But I didn't say we'd return to Europe."</p>

<p id="id02275">"What do you figure, then?"</p>

<p id="id02276">"I figure that after visiting these unusual waterways of Arabia
and Egypt, the Nautilus will go back down to the Indian Ocean,
perhaps through Mozambique Channel, perhaps off the Mascarene Islands,
and then make for the Cape of Good Hope."</p>

<p id="id02277">"And once we're at the Cape of Good Hope?" the Canadian asked
with typical persistence.</p>

<p id="id02278">"Well then, we'll enter that Atlantic Ocean with which we
aren't yet familiar.  What's wrong, Ned my friend?
Are you tired of this voyage under the seas?  Are you bored
with the constantly changing sight of these underwater wonders?
Speaking for myself, I'll be extremely distressed to see the end
of a voyage so few men will ever have a chance to make."</p>

<p id="id02279">"But don't you realize, Professor Aronnax," the Canadian replied,
"that soon we'll have been imprisoned for three whole months
aboard this Nautilus?"</p>

<p id="id02280">"No, Ned, I didn't realize it, I don't want to realize it, and I
don't keep track of every day and every hour."</p>

<p id="id02281">"But when will it be over?"</p>

<p id="id02282">"In its appointed time.  Meanwhile there's nothing we can do about it,
and our discussions are futile.  My gallant Ned, if you come and tell me,
'A chance to escape is available to us,' then I'll discuss it with you.
But that isn't the case, and in all honesty, I don't think Captain Nemo
ever ventures into European seas."</p>

<p id="id02283">This short dialogue reveals that in my mania for the Nautilus, I was
turning into the spitting image of its commander.</p>

<p id="id02284">As for Ned Land, he ended our talk in his best speechifying style:
"That's all fine and dandy.  But in my humble opinion, a life
in jail is a life without joy."</p>

<p id="id02285">For four days until February 3, the Nautilus inspected the Gulf of Oman
at various speeds and depths.  It seemed to be traveling at random,
as if hesitating over which course to follow, but it never crossed
the Tropic of Cancer.</p>

<p id="id02286">After leaving this gulf we raised Muscat for an instant,
the most important town in the country of Oman.  I marveled at its
strange appearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it,
against which the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply.
I spotted the rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant tips
of its minarets, and its fresh, leafy terraces.  But it was only
a fleeting vision, and the Nautilus soon sank beneath the dark
waves of these waterways.</p>

<p id="id02287">Then our ship went along at a distance of six miles from the Arabic
coasts of Mahra and Hadhramaut, their undulating lines of mountains
relieved by a few ancient ruins.  On February 5 we finally put
into the Gulf of Aden, a genuine funnel stuck into the neck of Bab
el Mandeb and bottling these Indian waters in the Red Sea.</p>

<p id="id02288">On February 6 the Nautilus cruised in sight of the city of Aden,
perched on a promontory connected to the continent by a narrow isthmus,
a sort of inaccessible Gibraltar whose fortifications the English
rebuilt after capturing it in 1839.  I glimpsed the octagonal
minarets of this town, which used to be one of the wealthiest,
busiest commercial centers along this coast, as the Arab historian
Idrisi tells it.</p>

<p id="id02289">I was convinced that when Captain Nemo reached this point,
he would back out again; but I was mistaken, and much to my surprise,
he did nothing of the sort.</p>

<p id="id02290">The next day, February 7, we entered the Strait of Bab el Mandeb,
whose name means "Gate of Tears" in the Arabic language.
Twenty miles wide, it's only fifty-two kilometers long,
and with the Nautilus launched at full speed, clearing it was
the work of barely an hour.  But I didn't see a thing, not even
Perim Island where the British government built fortifications
to strengthen Aden's position.  There were many English and French
steamers plowing this narrow passageway, liners going from Suez
to Bombay, Calcutta, Melbourne, R&#233;union Island, and Mauritius; far too
much traffic for the Nautilus to make an appearance on the surface.
So it wisely stayed in midwater.</p>

<p id="id02291">Finally, at noon, we were plowing the waves of the Red Sea.</p>

<p id="id02292">The Red Sea:  that great lake so famous in biblical traditions,
seldom replenished by rains, fed by no important rivers,
continually drained by a high rate of evaporation, its water level
dropping a meter and a half every year!  If it were fully landlocked
like a lake, this odd gulf might dry up completely; on this score
it's inferior to its neighbors, the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea,
whose levels lower only to the point where their evaporation exactly
equals the amounts of water they take to their hearts.</p>

<p id="id02293">This Red Sea is 2,600 kilometers long with an average width of 240.<br/>

In the days of the<br/></p>

<p id="id02294">Ptolemies and the Roman emperors, it was a great commercial
artery for the world, and when its isthmus has been cut through,
it will completely regain that bygone importance that the Suez
railways have already brought back in part.</p>

<p id="id02295">I would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced
Captain Nemo to take us into this gulf.  But I wholeheartedly
approved of the Nautilus's entering it.  It adopted a medium pace,
sometimes staying on the surface, sometimes diving to avoid some ship,
and so I could observe both the inside and topside of this
highly unusual sea.</p>

<p id="id02296">On February 8, as early as the first hours of daylight,
Mocha appeared before us:  a town now in ruins, whose walls
would collapse at the mere sound of a cannon, and which shelters
a few leafy date trees here and there.  This once-important city
used to contain six public marketplaces plus twenty-six mosques,
and its walls, protected by fourteen forts, fashioned a three-kilometer
girdle around it.</p>

<p id="id02297">Then the Nautilus drew near the beaches of Africa, where the sea is
considerably deeper.  There, through the open panels and in a midwater
of crystal clarity, our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes
of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green
furs of algae and fucus.  What an indescribable sight, and what
a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic
islands leveled off by the Libyan coast!  But soon the Nautilus hugged
the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory.
This was off the coast of Tihama, and there such zoophyte displays
not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned
picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it;
the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former,
which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters.</p>

<p id="id02298">How many delightful hours I spent in this way at the lounge window!
How many new specimens of underwater flora and fauna I
marveled at beneath the light of our electric beacon!
Mushroom-shaped fungus coral, some slate-colored sea anemone including
the species Thalassianthus aster among others, organ-pipe coral
arranged like flutes and just begging for a puff from the god Pan,
shells unique to this sea that dwell in madreporic cavities
and whose bases are twisted into squat spirals, and finally
a thousand samples of a polypary I hadn't observed until then:
the common sponge.</p>

<p id="id02299">First division in the polyp group, the class Spongiaria has been
created by scientists precisely for this unusual exhibit whose
usefulness is beyond dispute.  The sponge is definitely not a plant,
as some naturalists still believe, but an animal of the lowest order,
a polypary inferior even to coral.  Its animal nature isn't in doubt,
and we can't accept even the views of the ancients, who regarded
it as halfway between plant and animal.  But I must say that
naturalists are not in agreement on the structural mode of sponges.
For some it's a polypary, and for others, such as Professor Milne-Edwards,
it's a single, solitary individual.</p>

<p id="id02300">The class Spongiaria contains about 300 species that are encountered
in a large number of seas and even in certain streams, where they've
been given the name freshwater sponges.  But their waters of choice are
the Red Sea and the Mediterranean near the Greek Islands or the coast
of Syria.  These waters witness the reproduction and growth of soft,
delicate bath sponges whose prices run as high as 150 francs apiece:
the yellow sponge from Syria, the horn sponge from Barbary, etc.
But since I had no hope of studying these zoophytes in the seaports
of the Levant, from which we were separated by the insuperable Isthmus
of Suez, I had to be content with observing them in the waters
of the Red Sea.</p>

<p id="id02301">So I called Conseil to my side, while at an average depth of eight
to nine meters, the Nautilus slowly skimmed every beautiful rock
on the easterly coast.</p>

<p id="id02302">There sponges grew in every shape, globular, stalklike,
leaflike, fingerlike.  With reasonable accuracy, they lived up to
their nicknames of basket sponges, chalice sponges, distaff sponges,
elkhorn sponges, lion's paws, peacock's tails, and Neptune's gloves&#8212;
designations bestowed on them by fishermen, more poetically inclined
than scientists.  A gelatinous, semifluid substance coated the fibrous
tissue of these sponges, and from this tissue there escaped a steady
trickle of water that, after carrying sustenance to each cell,
was being expelled by a contracting movement.  This jellylike substance
disappears when the polyp dies, emitting ammonia as it rots.
Finally nothing remains but the fibers, either gelatinous or made
of horn, that constitute your household sponge, which takes on
a russet hue and is used for various tasks depending on its degree
of elasticity, permeability, or resistance to saturation.</p>

<p id="id02303">These polyparies were sticking to rocks, shells of mollusks, and even
the stalks of water plants.  They adorned the smallest crevices,
some sprawling, others standing or hanging like coral outgrowths.
I told Conseil that sponges are fished up in two ways, either by dragnet
or by hand.  The latter method calls for the services of a diver,
but it's preferable because it spares the polypary's tissue,
leaving it with a much higher market value.</p>

<p id="id02304">Other zoophytes swarming near the sponges consisted chiefly of a very
elegant species of jellyfish; mollusks were represented by varieties
of squid that, according to Professor Orbigny, are unique to the Red Sea;
and reptiles by virgata turtles belonging to the genus Chelonia,
which furnished our table with a dainty but wholesome dish.</p>

<p id="id02305">As for fish, they were numerous and often remarkable.  Here are
the ones that the Nautilus's nets most frequently hauled on board:
rays, including spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick
red in color, their bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and
identifiable by their jagged double stings, silver-backed skates,
common stingrays with stippled tails, butterfly rays that looked
like huge two-meter cloaks flapping at middepth, toothless guitarfish
that were a type of cartilaginous fish closer to the shark,
trunkfish known as dromedaries that were one and a half feet long
and had humps ending in backward-curving stings, serpentine moray
eels with silver tails and bluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed
in gray piping, a species of butterfish called the fiatola decked
out in thin gold stripes and the three colors of the French flag,
Montague blennies four decimeters long, superb jacks handsomely
embellished by seven black crosswise streaks with blue and yellow
fins plus gold and silver scales, snooks, standard mullet with
yellow heads, parrotfish, wrasse, triggerfish, gobies, etc., plus
a thousand other fish common to the oceans we had already crossed.</p>

<p id="id02306">On February 9 the Nautilus cruised in the widest part of the Red Sea,
measuring 190 miles straight across from Suakin on the west coast
to Qunfidha on the east coast.</p>

<p id="id02307">At noon that day after our position fix, Captain Nemo climbed onto
the platform, where I happened to be.  I vowed not to let him go
below again without at least sounding him out on his future plans.
As soon as he saw me, he came over, graciously offered me a cigar,
and said to me:</p>

<p id="id02308">"Well, professor, are you pleased with this Red Sea?  Have you seen
enough of its hidden wonders, its fish and zoophytes, its gardens
of sponges and forests of coral?  Have you glimpsed the towns built
on its shores?"</p>

<p id="id02309">"Yes, Captain Nemo," I replied, "and the Nautilus is wonderfully
suited to this whole survey.  Ah, it's a clever boat!"</p>

<p id="id02310">"Yes, sir, clever, daring, and invulnerable!  It fears neither
the Red Sea's dreadful storms nor its currents and reefs."</p>

<p id="id02311">"Indeed," I said, "this sea is mentioned as one of the worst,
and in the days of the ancients, if I'm not mistaken, it had
an abominable reputation."</p>

<p id="id02312">"Thoroughly abominable, Professor Aronnax.  The Greek and Latin
historians can find nothing to say in its favor, and the Greek
geographer Strabo adds that it's especially rough during
the rainy season and the period of summer prevailing winds.
The Arab Idrisi, referring to it by the name Gulf of Colzoum,
relates that ships perished in large numbers on its sandbanks
and that no one risked navigating it by night.  This, he claims,
is a sea subject to fearful hurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands,
and 'with nothing good to offer,' either on its surface or in
its depths.  As a matter of fact, the same views can also be found
in Arrian, Agatharchides, and Artemidorus."</p>

<p id="id02313">"One can easily see," I answered, "that those historians didn't
navigate aboard the Nautilus."</p>

<p id="id02314">"Indeed," the captain replied with a smile, "and in this respect,<br/>

the moderns aren't much farther along than the ancients.<br/>

It took many centuries to discover the mechanical power of steam!<br/>

Who knows whether we'll see a second Nautilus within the next 100 years!<br/>

Progress is slow, Professor Aronnax."<br/></p>

<p id="id02315">"It's true," I replied.  "Your ship is a century ahead of its time,
perhaps several centuries.  It would be most unfortunate if such
a secret were to die with its inventor!"</p>

<p id="id02316">Captain Nemo did not reply.  After some minutes of silence:</p>

<p id="id02317">"We were discussing," he said, "the views of ancient historians
on the dangers of navigating this Red Sea?"</p>

<p id="id02318">"True," I replied.  "But weren't their fears exaggerated?"</p>

<p id="id02319">"Yes and no, Professor Aronnax," answered Captain Nemo,
who seemed to know "his Red Sea" by heart.  "To a modern ship,
well rigged, solidly constructed, and in control of its course
thanks to obedient steam, some conditions are no longer hazardous
that offered all sorts of dangers to the vessels of the ancients.
Picture those early navigators venturing forth in sailboats
built from planks lashed together with palm-tree ropes,
caulked with powdered resin, and coated with dogfish grease.
They didn't even have instruments for taking their bearings,
they went by guesswork in the midst of currents they barely knew.
Under such conditions, shipwrecks had to be numerous.
But nowadays steamers providing service between Suez and the South Seas
have nothing to fear from the fury of this gulf, despite the contrary
winds of its monsoons.  Their captains and passengers no longer
prepare for departure with sacrifices to placate the gods,
and after returning, they don't traipse in wreaths and gold ribbons
to say thanks at the local temple."</p>

<p id="id02320">"Agreed," I said.  "And steam seems to have killed off all gratitude
in seamen's hearts.  But since you seem to have made a special study
of this sea, captain, can you tell me how it got its name?"</p>

<p id="id02321">"Many explanations exist on the subject, Professor Aronnax.  Would you
like to hear the views of one chronicler in the 14th century?"</p>

<p id="id02322">"Gladly."</p>

<p id="id02323">"This fanciful fellow claims the sea was given its name after
the crossing of the Israelites, when the Pharaoh perished in those
waves that came together again at Moses' command:</p>

<p id="id02324">To mark that miraculous sequel, the sea turned a red without equal.</p>

<p id="id02325">Thus no other course would do but to name it for its hue."</p>

<p id="id02326">"An artistic explanation, Captain Nemo," I replied, "but I'm unable
to rest content with it.  So I'll ask you for your own personal views."</p>

<p id="id02327">"Here they come.  To my thinking, Professor Aronnax, this 'Red Sea'
designation must be regarded as a translation of the Hebrew word
'Edrom,' and if the ancients gave it that name, it was because of
the unique color of its waters."</p>

<p id="id02328">"Until now, however, I've seen only clear waves, without any unique hue."</p>

<p id="id02329">"Surely, but as we move ahead to the far end of this gulf,
you'll note its odd appearance.  I recall seeing the bay of El Tur
completely red, like a lake of blood."</p>

<p id="id02330">"And you attribute this color to the presence of microscopic algae?"</p>

<p id="id02331">"Yes.  It's a purplish, mucilaginous substance produced by those tiny
buds known by the name trichodesmia, 40,000 of which are needed
to occupy the space of one square millimeter.  Perhaps you'll
encounter them when we reach El Tur."</p>

<p id="id02332">"Hence, Captain Nemo, this isn't the first time you've gone through
the Red Sea aboard the Nautilus?"</p>

<p id="id02333">"No, sir."</p>

<p id="id02334">"Then, since you've already mentioned the crossing of the Israelites
and the catastrophe that befell the Egyptians, I would ask if you've ever
discovered any traces under the waters of that great historic event?"</p>

<p id="id02335">"No, professor, and for an excellent reason."</p>

<p id="id02336">"What's that?"</p>

<p id="id02337">"It's because that same locality where Moses crossed with all his people
is now so clogged with sand, camels can barely get their legs wet.
You can understand that my Nautilus wouldn't have enough
water for itself."</p>

<p id="id02338">"And that locality is . . . ?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id02339">"That locality lies a little above Suez in a sound that used to form
a deep estuary when the Red Sea stretched as far as the Bitter Lakes.
Now, whether or not their crossing was literally miraculous,
the Israelites did cross there in returning to the Promised Land,
and the Pharaoh's army did perish at precisely that locality.
So I think that excavating those sands would bring to light a great
many weapons and tools of Egyptian origin."</p>

<p id="id02340">"Obviously," I replied.  "And for the sake of archaeology, let's hope
that sooner or later such excavations do take place, once new towns
are settled on the isthmus after the Suez Canal has been cut through&#8212;
a canal, by the way, of little use to a ship such as the Nautilus!"</p>

<p id="id02341">"Surely, but of great use to the world at large," Captain Nemo said.
"The ancients well understood the usefulness to commerce of connecting
the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, but they never dreamed of cutting
a canal between the two, and instead they picked the Nile as their link.
If we can trust tradition, it was probably Egypt's King Sesostris
who started digging the canal needed to join the Nile with
the Red Sea.  What's certain is that in 615 B.C. King Necho II
was hard at work on a canal that was fed by Nile water and ran
through the Egyptian plains opposite Arabia.  This canal could
be traveled in four days, and it was so wide, two triple-tiered
galleys could pass through it abreast.  Its construction was
continued by Darius the Great, son of Hystaspes, and probably
completed by King Ptolemy II.  Strabo saw it used for shipping;
but the weakness of its slope between its starting point, near Bubastis,
and the Red Sea left it navigable only a few months out of the year.
This canal served commerce until the century of Rome's Antonine emperors;
it was then abandoned and covered with sand, subsequently reinstated
by Arabia's Caliph Omar I, and finally filled in for good in 761
or 762 A.D. by Caliph Al-Mansur, in an effort to prevent supplies
from reaching Mohammed ibn Abdullah, who had rebelled against him.
During his Egyptian campaign, your General Napoleon Bonaparte
discovered traces of this old canal in the Suez desert, and when
the tide caught him by surprise, he wellnigh perished just a few
hours before rejoining his regiment at Hadjaroth, the very place
where Moses had pitched camp 3,300 years before him."</p>

<p id="id02342">"Well, captain, what the ancients hesitated to undertake, Mr. de
Lesseps is now finishing up; his joining of these two seas will
shorten the route from Cadiz to the East Indies by 9,000 kilometers,
and he'll soon change Africa into an immense island."</p>

<p id="id02343">"Yes, Professor Aronnax, and you have every right to be proud of your
fellow countryman.  Such a man brings a nation more honor than the
greatest commanders!  Like so many others, he began with difficulties
and setbacks, but he triumphed because he has the volunteer spirit.
And it's sad to think that this deed, which should have been an
international deed, which would have insured that any administration
went down in history, will succeed only through the efforts of one man.
So all hail to Mr. de Lesseps!"</p>

<p id="id02344">"Yes, all hail to that great French citizen," I replied,
quite startled by how emphatically Captain Nemo had just spoken.</p>

<p id="id02345">"Unfortunately," he went on, "I can't take you through that Suez Canal,
but the day after tomorrow, you'll be able to see the long jetties
of Port Said when we're in the Mediterranean."</p>

<p id="id02346">"In the Mediterranean!"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id02347">"Yes, professor.  Does that amaze you?"</p>

<p id="id02348">"What amazes me is thinking we'll be there the day after tomorrow."</p>

<p id="id02349">"Oh really?"</p>

<p id="id02350">"Yes, captain, although since I've been aboard your vessel,<br/>

I should have formed the habit of not being amazed by anything!"<br/></p>

<p id="id02351">"But what is it that startles you?"</p>

<p id="id02352">"The thought of how hideously fast the Nautilus will need to go,
if it's to double the Cape of Good Hope, circle around Africa,
and lie in the open Mediterranean by the day after tomorrow."</p>

<p id="id02353">"And who says it will circle Africa, professor?  What's this talk
about doubling the Cape of Good Hope?"</p>

<p id="id02354">"But unless the Nautilus navigates on dry land and crosses
over the isthmus&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id02355">"Or under it, Professor Aronnax."</p>

<p id="id02356">"Under it?"</p>

<p id="id02357">"Surely," Captain Nemo replied serenely.  "Under that tongue of land,
nature long ago made what man today is making on its surface."</p>

<p id="id02358">"What!  There's a passageway?"</p>

<p id="id02359">"Yes, an underground passageway that I've named the Arabian Tunnel.<br/>

It starts below Suez and leads to the Bay of Pelusium."<br/></p>

<p id="id02360">"But isn't that isthmus only composed of quicksand?"</p>

<p id="id02361">"To a certain depth.  But at merely fifty meters, one encounters
a firm foundation of rock."</p>

<p id="id02362">"And it's by luck that you discovered this passageway?"<br/>

I asked, more and more startled.<br/></p>

<p id="id02363">"Luck plus logic, professor, and logic even more than luck."</p>

<p id="id02364">"Captain, I hear you, but I can't believe my ears."</p>

<p id="id02365">"Oh, sir!  The old saying still holds good: Aures
habent et non audient!<a id="noteref-1b"
href="twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-seas-18.html#note-1b">[1]</a>
Not only does this passageway exist, but I've taken advantage of it on
several occasions.  Without it, I wouldn't have ventured today into
such a blind alley as the Red Sea."</p>

<p id="id02367">"Is it indiscreet to ask how you discovered this tunnel?"</p>

<p id="id02368">"Sir," the captain answered me, "there can be no secrets between men
who will never leave each other."</p>

<p id="id02369">I ignored this innuendo and waited for Captain Nemo's explanation.</p>

<p id="id02370">"Professor," he told me, "the simple logic of the naturalist led
me to discover this passageway, and I alone am familiar with it.
I'd noted that in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean there exist
a number of absolutely identical species of fish:  eels, butterfish,
greenfish, bass, jewelfish, flying fish.  Certain of this fact,
I wondered if there weren't a connection between the two seas.
If there were, its underground current had to go from the Red Sea
to the Mediterranean simply because of their difference in level.
So I caught a large number of fish in the vicinity of Suez.  I slipped
copper rings around their tails and tossed them back into the sea.
A few months later off the coast of Syria, I recaptured a few
specimens of my fish, adorned with their telltale rings.
So this proved to me that some connection existed between the two seas.
I searched for it with my Nautilus, I discovered it, I ventured into it;
and soon, professor, you also will have cleared my Arabic tunnel!"</p>

<h2 id="id02371">CHAPTER 5</h2>

<h6 id="id02372">Arabian Tunnel</h6>

<p id="id02373">THE SAME DAY, I reported to Conseil and Ned Land that part of
the foregoing conversation directly concerning them.  When I told
them we would be lying in Mediterranean waters within two days,
Conseil clapped his hands, but the Canadian shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p id="id02374">"An underwater tunnel!" he exclaimed.  "A connection between two seas!<br/>

Who ever heard of such malarkey!"<br/></p>

<p id="id02375">"Ned my friend," Conseil replied, "had you ever heard of
the Nautilus?  No, yet here it is!  So don't shrug your shoulders
so blithely, and don't discount something with the feeble excuse
that you've never heard of it."</p>

<p id="id02376">"We'll soon see!"  Ned Land shot back, shaking his head.
"After all, I'd like nothing better than to believe in your captain's
little passageway, and may Heaven grant it really does take us
to the Mediterranean."</p>

<p id="id02377">The same evening, at latitude 21 degrees 30' north, the Nautilus was
afloat on the surface of the sea and drawing nearer to the Arab coast.
I spotted Jidda, an important financial center for Egypt, Syria, Turkey,
and the East Indies.  I could distinguish with reasonable clarity
the overall effect of its buildings, the ships made fast along
its wharves, and those bigger vessels whose draft of water
required them to drop anchor at the port's offshore mooring.
The sun, fairly low on the horizon, struck full force on the houses
in this town, accenting their whiteness.  Outside the city limits,
some wood or reed huts indicated the quarter where the bedouins lived.</p>

<p id="id02378">Soon Jidda faded into the shadows of evening, and the Nautilus went
back beneath the mildly phosphorescent waters.</p>

<p id="id02379">The next day, February 10, several ships appeared, running on our
opposite tack.  The Nautilus resumed its underwater navigating;
but at the moment of our noon sights, the sea was deserted and the ship
rose again to its waterline.</p>

<p id="id02380">With Ned and Conseil, I went to sit on the platform.  The coast
to the east looked like a slightly blurred mass in a damp fog.</p>

<p id="id02381">Leaning against the sides of the skiff, we were chatting of one
thing and another, when Ned Land stretched his hand toward a point
in the water, saying to me:</p>

<p id="id02382">"See anything out there, professor?"</p>

<p id="id02383">"No, Ned," I replied, "but you know I don't have your eyes."</p>

<p id="id02384">"Take a good look," Ned went on.  "There, ahead to starboard,
almost level with the beacon!  Don't you see a mass that seems
to be moving around?"</p>

<p id="id02385">"Right," I said after observing carefully, "I can make out something
like a long, blackish object on the surface of the water."</p>

<p id="id02386">"A second Nautilus?"  Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id02387">"No," the Canadian replied, "unless I'm badly mistaken,
that's some marine animal."</p>

<p id="id02388">"Are there whales in the Red Sea?"  Conseil asked.</p>

<p id="id02389">"Yes, my boy," I replied, "they're sometimes found here."</p>

<p id="id02390">"That's no whale," continued Ned Land, whose eyes never strayed
from the object they had sighted.  "We're old chums, whales and I,
and I couldn't mistake their little ways."</p>

<p id="id02391">"Let's wait and see," Conseil said.  "The Nautilus is heading
that direction, and we'll soon know what we're in for."</p>

<p id="id02392">In fact, that blackish object was soon only a mile away from us.<br/>

It looked like a huge reef stranded in midocean.  What was it?<br/>

I still couldn't make up my mind.<br/></p>

<p id="id02393">"Oh, it's moving off!  It's diving!"  Ned Land exclaimed.
"Damnation!  What can that animal be?  It doesn't have a forked
tail like baleen whales or sperm whales, and its fins look
like sawed-off limbs."</p>

<p id="id02394">"But in that case&#8212;" I put in.</p>

<p id="id02395">"Good lord," the Canadian went on, "it's rolled over on its back,
and it's raising its breasts in the air!"</p>

<p id="id02396">"It's a siren!"  Conseil exclaimed.  "With all due respect to master,
it's an actual mermaid!"</p>

<p id="id02397">That word "siren" put me back on track, and I realized that the animal
belonged to the order Sirenia:  marine creatures that legends
have turned into mermaids, half woman, half fish.</p>

<p id="id02398">"No," I told Conseil, "that's no mermaid, it's an unusual creature
of which only a few specimens are left in the Red Sea.  That's a dugong."</p>

<p id="id02399">"Order Sirenia, group Pisciforma, subclass Monodelphia, class Mammalia,
branch Vertebrata," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id02400">And when Conseil has spoken, there's nothing else to be said.</p>

<p id="id02401">Meanwhile Ned Land kept staring.  His eyes were gleaming with desire
at the sight of that animal.  His hands were ready to hurl a harpoon.
You would have thought he was waiting for the right moment to jump
overboard and attack the creature in its own element.</p>

<p id="id02402">"Oh, sir," he told me in a voice trembling with excitement,<br/>

"I've never killed anything like that!"<br/></p>

<p id="id02403">His whole being was concentrated in this last word.</p>

<p id="id02404">Just then Captain Nemo appeared on the platform.  He spotted the dugong.<br/>

He understood the Canadian's frame of mind and addressed him directly:<br/></p>

<p id="id02405">"If you held a harpoon, Mr. Land, wouldn't your hands be itching
to put it to work?"</p>

<p id="id02406">"Positively, sir."</p>

<p id="id02407">"And just for one day, would it displease you to return to your
fisherman's trade and add this cetacean to the list of those you've
already hunted down?"</p>

<p id="id02408">"It wouldn't displease me one bit."</p>

<p id="id02409">"All right, you can try your luck!"</p>

<p id="id02410">"Thank you, sir," Ned Land replied, his eyes ablaze.</p>

<p id="id02411">"Only," the captain went on, "I urge you to aim carefully at this animal,
in your own personal interest."</p>

<p id="id02412">"Is the dugong dangerous to attack?"  I asked, despite the Canadian's
shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p id="id02413">"Yes, sometimes," the captain replied.  "These animals have been
known to turn on their assailants and capsize their longboats.
But with Mr. Land that danger isn't to be feared.  His eye is sharp,
his arm is sure.  If I recommend that he aim carefully at this dugong,
it's because the animal is justly regarded as fine game, and I know
Mr. Land doesn't despise a choice morsel."</p>

<p id="id02414">"Aha!" the Canadian put in.  "This beast offers the added luxury
of being good to eat?"</p>

<p id="id02415">"Yes, Mr. Land.  Its flesh is actual red meat, highly prized,
and set aside throughout Malaysia for the tables of aristocrats.
Accordingly, this excellent animal has been hunted so bloodthirstily that,
like its manatee relatives, it has become more and more scarce."</p>

<p id="id02416">"In that case, captain," Conseil said in all seriousness,
"on the offchance that this creature might be the last of its line,
wouldn't it be advisable to spare its life, in the interests of science?"</p>

<p id="id02417">"Maybe," the Canadian answered, "it would be better to hunt it down,
in the interests of mealtime."</p>

<p id="id02418">"Then proceed, Mr. Land," Captain Nemo replied.</p>

<p id="id02419">Just then, as mute and emotionless as ever, seven crewmen climbed
onto the platform.  One carried a harpoon and line similar
to those used in whale fishing.  Its deck paneling opened,
the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea.
Six rowers sat on the thwarts, and the coxswain took the tiller.
Ned, Conseil, and I found seats in the stern.</p>

<p id="id02420">"Aren't you coming, captain?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id02421">"No, sir, but I wish you happy hunting."</p>

<p id="id02422">The skiff pulled clear, and carried off by its six oars, it headed
swiftly toward the dugong, which by then was floating two miles
from the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id02423">Arriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean, our longboat
slowed down, and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil waters.
Harpoon in hand, Ned Land went to take his stand in the skiff's bow.
Harpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to a very long
rope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags it with him.
But this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms, and its end
had simply been fastened to a small barrel that, while floating,
would indicate the dugong's movements beneath the waters.</p>

<p id="id02424">I stood up and could clearly observe the Canadian's adversary.
This dugong&#8212;which also boasts the name halicore&#8212;closely resembled
a manatee.  Its oblong body ended in a very long caudal fin and
its lateral fins in actual fingers.  It differs from the manatee
in that its upper jaw is armed with two long, pointed teeth that form
diverging tusks on either side.</p>

<p id="id02425">This dugong that Ned Land was preparing to attack was of
colossal dimensions, easily exceeding seven meters in length.
It didn't stir and seemed to be sleeping on the surface of the waves,
a circumstance that should have made it easier to capture.</p>

<p id="id02426">The skiff approached cautiously to within three fathoms of the animal.<br/>

The oars hung suspended above their rowlocks.  I was crouching.<br/>

His body leaning slightly back, Ned Land brandished his harpoon<br/>

with expert hands.<br/></p>

<p id="id02427">Suddenly a hissing sound was audible, and the dugong disappeared.
Although the harpoon had been forcefully hurled, it apparently
had hit only water.</p>

<p id="id02428">"Damnation!" exclaimed the furious Canadian.  "I missed it!"</p>

<p id="id02429">"No," I said, "the animal's wounded, there's its blood; but your
weapon didn't stick in its body."</p>

<p id="id02430">"My harpoon!  Get my harpoon!"  Ned Land exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id02431">The sailors went back to their sculling, and the coxswain steered
the longboat toward the floating barrel.  We fished up the harpoon,
and the skiff started off in pursuit of the animal.</p>

<p id="id02432">The latter returned from time to time to breathe at the surface
of the sea.  Its wound hadn't weakened it because it went with
tremendous speed.  Driven by energetic arms, the longboat flew
on its trail.  Several times we got within a few fathoms of it,
and the Canadian hovered in readiness to strike; but then the dugong
would steal away with a sudden dive, and it proved impossible
to overtake the beast.</p>

<p id="id02433">I'll let you assess the degree of anger consuming our impatient
Ned Land.  He hurled at the hapless animal the most potent swearwords
in the English language.  For my part, I was simply distressed
to see this dugong outwit our every scheme.</p>

<p id="id02434">We chased it unflaggingly for a full hour, and I'd begun to think it would
prove too difficult to capture, when the animal got the untimely idea
of taking revenge on us, a notion it would soon have cause to regret.
It wheeled on the skiff, to assault us in its turn.</p>

<p id="id02435">This maneuver did not escape the Canadian.</p>

<p id="id02436">"Watch out!" he said.</p>

<p id="id02437">The coxswain pronounced a few words in his bizarre language,
and no doubt he alerted his men to keep on their guard.</p>

<p id="id02438">Arriving within twenty feet of the skiff, the dugong stopped,
sharply sniffing the air with its huge nostrils, pierced not at
the tip of its muzzle but on its topside.  Then it gathered itself
and sprang at us.</p>

<p id="id02439">The skiff couldn't avoid the collision.  Half overturned,
it shipped a ton or two of water that we had to bail out.
But thanks to our skillful coxswain, we were fouled on the bias rather
than broadside, so we didn't capsize.  Clinging to the stempost,
Ned Land thrust his harpoon again and again into the gigantic animal,
which imbedded its teeth in our gunwale and lifted the longboat
out of the water as a lion would lift a deer.  We were thrown on
top of each other, and I have no idea how the venture would have
ended had not the Canadian, still thirsting for the beast's blood,
finally pierced it to the heart.</p>

<p id="id02440">I heard its teeth grind on sheet iron, and the dugong disappeared,
taking our harpoon along with it.  But the barrel soon popped up
on the surface, and a few moments later the animal's body appeared
and rolled over on its back.  Our skiff rejoined it, took it in tow,
and headed to the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id02441">It took pulleys of great strength to hoist this dugong onto the platform.
The beast weighed 5,000 kilograms.  It was carved up in sight of
the Canadian, who remained to watch every detail of the operation.
At dinner the same day, my steward served me some slices of this flesh,
skillfully dressed by the ship's cook.  I found it excellent,
even better than veal if not beef.</p>

<p id="id02442">The next morning, February 11, the Nautilus's pantry was
enriched by more dainty game.  A covey of terns alighted on
the Nautilus.  They were a species of Sterna nilotica unique to Egypt:
beak black, head gray and stippled, eyes surrounded by white dots,
back, wings, and tail grayish, belly and throat white, feet red.
Also caught were a couple dozen Nile duck, superior-tasting wildfowl
whose neck and crown of the head are white speckled with black.</p>

<p id="id02443">By then the Nautilus had reduced speed.  It moved ahead at a saunter,
so to speak.  I observed that the Red Sea's water was becoming less
salty the closer we got to Suez.</p>

<p id="id02444">Near five o'clock in the afternoon, we sighted Cape Ras Mohammed
to the north.  This cape forms the tip of Arabia Petraea, which lies
between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>

<p id="id02445">The Nautilus entered the Strait of Jubal, which leads to the Gulf
of Suez.  I could clearly make out a high mountain crowning Ras Mohammed
between the two gulfs.  It was Mt.  Horeb, that biblical Mt.  Sinai on
whose summit Moses met God face to face, that summit the mind's
eye always pictures as wreathed in lightning.</p>

<p id="id02446">At six o'clock, sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged, the Nautilus
passed well out from El Tur, which sat at the far end of a bay whose
waters seemed to be dyed red, as Captain Nemo had already mentioned.
Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken
by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds, by the sound of surf
chafing against rocks, or by the distant moan of a steamer churning
the waves of the gulf with noisy blades.</p>

<p id="id02447">From eight to nine o'clock, the Nautilus stayed a few meters
beneath the waters.  According to my calculations, we had
to be quite close to Suez.  Through the panels in the lounge,
I spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays.
It seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower.</p>

<p id="id02448">At 9:15 when our boat returned to the surface, I climbed onto
the platform.  I was quite impatient to clear Captain Nemo's tunnel,
couldn't sit still, and wanted to breathe the fresh night air.</p>

<p id="id02449">Soon, in the shadows, I spotted a pale signal light glimmering
a mile away, half discolored by mist.</p>

<p id="id02450">"A floating lighthouse," said someone next to me.</p>

<p id="id02451">I turned and discovered the captain.</p>

<p id="id02452">"That's the floating signal light of Suez," he went on.<br/>

"It won't be long before we reach the entrance to the tunnel."<br/></p>

<p id="id02453">"It can't be very easy to enter it."</p>

<p id="id02454">"No, sir.  Accordingly, I'm in the habit of staying in the pilothouse
and directing maneuvers myself.  And now if you'll kindly go below,
Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus is about to sink beneath the waves,
and it will only return to the surface after we've cleared
the Arabian Tunnel."</p>

<p id="id02455">I followed Captain Nemo.  The hatch closed, the ballast tanks filled
with water, and the submersible sank some ten meters down.</p>

<p id="id02456">Just as I was about to repair to my stateroom, the captain stopped me.</p>

<p id="id02457">"Professor," he said to me, "would you like to go with me
to the wheelhouse?"</p>

<p id="id02458">"I was afraid to ask," I replied.</p>

<p id="id02459">"Come along, then.  This way, you'll learn the full story about this
combination underwater and underground navigating."</p>

<p id="id02460">Captain Nemo led me to the central companionway.  In midstair
he opened a door, went along the upper gangways, and arrived at
the wheelhouse, which, as you know, stands at one end of the platform.</p>

<p id="id02461">It was a cabin measuring six feet square and closely resembling
those occupied by the helmsmen of steamboats on the Mississippi
or Hudson rivers.  In the center stood an upright wheel
geared to rudder cables running to the Nautilus's stern.
Set in the cabin's walls were four deadlights, windows of biconvex
glass that enabled the man at the helm to see in every direction.</p>

<p id="id02462">The cabin was dark; but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness
and I saw the pilot, a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs
of the wheel.  Outside, the sea was brightly lit by the beacon
shining behind the cabin at the other end of the platform.</p>

<p id="id02463">"Now," Captain Nemo said, "let's look for our passageway."</p>

<p id="id02464">Electric wires linked the pilothouse with the engine room,
and from this cabin the captain could simultaneously signal heading
and speed to his Nautilus.  He pressed a metal button and at once
the propeller slowed down significantly.</p>

<p id="id02465">I stared in silence at the high, sheer wall we were skirting just then,
the firm base of the sandy mountains on the coast.  For an hour we
went along it in this fashion, staying only a few meters away.
Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the two concentric circles
of the compass hanging in the cabin.  At a mere gesture from him,
the helmsman would instantly change the Nautilus's heading.</p>

<p id="id02466">Standing by the port deadlight, I spotted magnificent coral substructures,
zoophytes, algae, and crustaceans with enormous quivering claws
that stretched forth from crevices in the rock.</p>

<p id="id02467">At 10:15 Captain Nemo himself took the helm.  Dark and deep, a wide
gallery opened ahead of us.  The Nautilus was brazenly swallowed up.
Strange rumblings were audible along our sides.  It was the water
of the Red Sea, hurled toward the Mediterranean by the tunnel's slope.
Our engines tried to offer resistance by churning the waves
with propeller in reverse, but the Nautilus went with the torrent,
as swift as an arrow.</p>

<p id="id02468">Along the narrow walls of this passageway, I saw only brilliant streaks,
hard lines, fiery furrows, all scrawled by our speeding electric light.
With my hand I tried to curb the pounding of my heart.</p>

<p id="id02469">At 10:35 Captain Nemo left the steering wheel and turned to me:</p>

<p id="id02470">"The Mediterranean," he told me.</p>

<p id="id02471">In less than twenty minutes, swept along by the torrent, the Nautilus
had just cleared the Isthmus of Suez.</p>
