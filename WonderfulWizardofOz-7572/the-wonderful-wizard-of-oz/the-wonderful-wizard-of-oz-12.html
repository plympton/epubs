<body><p>"We have surely lost our way," he said, "and unless we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains."</p>
<p>"Nor I my heart," declared the Tin Woodman. "It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long journey."</p>
<p>"You see," said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, "I haven't the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all."</p>
<p>Then Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.</p>
<p>"Suppose we call the field mice," she suggested. "They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City."</p>
<p>"To be sure they could," cried the Scarecrow. "Why didn't we think of that before?"</p>
<p>Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her squeaky little voice:</p>
<p>"What can I do for my friends?"</p>
<p>"We have lost our way," said Dorothy. "Can you tell us where the Emerald City is?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," answered the Queen; "but it is a great way off, for you have had it at your backs all this time." Then she noticed Dorothy's Golden Cap, and said, "Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour."</p>
<p>"I didn't know there was a charm," answered Dorothy, in surprise. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"It is written inside the Golden Cap," replied the Queen of the Mice. "But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us."</p>
<p>"Won't they hurt me?" asked the girl anxiously.</p>
<p>"Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!" And she scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.</p>
<p>Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.</p>
<p>"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing on her left foot.</p>
<p>"What did you say?" asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was doing.</p>
<p>"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" Dorothy went on, standing this time on her right foot.</p>
<p>"Hello!" replied the Tin Woodman calmly.</p>
<p>"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.</p>
<p>The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, "What is your command?"</p>
<p>"We wish to go to the Emerald City," said the child, "and we have lost our way."</p>
<p>"We will carry you," replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her. Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him.</p>
<p>The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them.</p>
<p>Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?" she asked.</p>
<p>"That is a long story," answered the King, with a Winged laugh; "but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish."</p>
<p>"I shall be glad to hear it," she replied.</p>
<p>"Once," began the leader, "we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land.</p>
<p>"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.</p>
<p>"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.</p>
<p>"`Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, `and see if the water has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore. But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river.</p>
<p>"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be."</p>
<p>"And what became of them?" asked Dorothy, who had been greatly interested in the story.</p>
<p>"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap," replied the Monkey, "he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her.</p>
<p>"This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us."</p>
<p>As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.</p>
<p>"That was a good ride," said the little girl.</p>
<p>"Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles," replied the Lion. "How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!"</p>

<h2 class="c2" id="dlepubid00021">15. The Discovery of Oz, the Terrible</h2>
<p>The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before.</p>
<p>"What! are you back again?" he asked, in surprise.</p>
<p>"Do you not see us?" answered the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>"But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West."</p>
<p>"We did visit her," said the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>"And she let you go again?" asked the man, in wonder.</p>
<p>"She could not help it, for she is melted," explained the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>"Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed," said the man. "Who melted her?"</p>
<p>"It was Dorothy," said the Lion gravely.</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before her.</p>
<p>Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.</p>
<p>The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.</p>
<p>The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not. When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o'clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.</p>
<p>The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again.</p>
<p>Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz.</p>
<p>Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.</p>
<p>Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome, and it said:</p>
<p>"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?"</p>
<p>They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, Dorothy asked, "Where are you?"</p>
<p>"I am everywhere," answered the Voice, "but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me." Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said:</p>
<p>"We have come to claim our promise, O Oz."</p>
<p>"What promise?" asked Oz.</p>
<p>"You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroyed," said the girl.</p>
<p>"And you promised to give me brains," said the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>"And you promised to give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.</p>
<p>"And you promised to give me courage," said the Cowardly Lion.</p>
<p>"Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?" asked the Voice, and Dorothy thought it trembled a little.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered, "I melted her with a bucket of water."</p>
<p>"Dear me," said the Voice, "how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for I must have time to think it over."</p>
<p>"You've had plenty of time already," said the Tin Woodman angrily.</p>
<p>"We shan't wait a day longer," said the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>"You must keep your promises to us!" exclaimed Dorothy.</p>
