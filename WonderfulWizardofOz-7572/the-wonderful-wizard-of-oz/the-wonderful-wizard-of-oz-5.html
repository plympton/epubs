<body><p>"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her."</p>
<p>Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.</p>
<p>"All the same," said the Scarecrow, "I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one."</p>
<p>"I shall take the heart," returned the Tin Woodman; "for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world."</p>
<p>Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.</p>
<p>What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.</p>

<h2 class="c2" id="dlepubid00012">6. The Cowardly Lion</h2>
<p>All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good.</p>
<p>There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side, and did not even bark in return.</p>
<p>"How long will it be," the child asked of the Tin Woodman, "before we are out of the forest?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell," was the answer, "for I have never been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that will protect you from harm."</p>
<p>"But Toto!" said the girl anxiously. "What will protect him?"</p>
<p>"We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger," replied the Tin Woodman.</p>
<p>Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.</p>
<p>Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:</p>
<p>"Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!"</p>
<p>"I didn't bite him," said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it.</p>
<p>"No, but you tried to," she retorted. "You are nothing but a big coward."</p>
<p>"I know it," said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. "I've always known it. But how can I help it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like the poor Scarecrow!"</p>
<p>"Is he stuffed?" asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shape again.</p>
<p>"Of course he's stuffed," replied Dorothy, who was still angry.</p>
<p>"That's why he went over so easily," remarked the Lion. "It astonished me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?"</p>
<p>"No," said Dorothy, "he's made of tin." And she helped the Woodman up again.</p>
<p>"That's why he nearly blunted my claws," said the Lion. "When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What is that little animal you are so tender of?"</p>
<p>"He is my dog, Toto," answered Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?" asked the Lion.</p>
<p>"Neither. He's a--a--a meat dog," said the girl.</p>
<p>"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me," continued the Lion sadly.</p>
<p>"What makes you a coward?" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.</p>
<p>"It's a mystery," replied the Lion. "I suppose I was born that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way. Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself--I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go."</p>
<p>"But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward," said the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>"I know it," returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. "It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy. But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you have heart disease," said the Tin Woodman.</p>
<p>"It may be," said the Lion.</p>
<p>"If you have," continued the Tin Woodman, "you ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart disease."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," said the Lion thoughtfully, "if I had no heart I should not be a coward."</p>
<p>"Have you brains?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>"I suppose so. I've never looked to see," replied the Lion.</p>
<p>"I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some," remarked the Scarecrow, "for my head is stuffed with straw."</p>
<p>"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart," said the Woodman.</p>
<p>"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas," added Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Do you think Oz could give me courage?" asked the Cowardly Lion.</p>
<p>"Just as easily as he could give me brains," said the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>"Or give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.</p>
<p>"Or send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you," said the Lion, "for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage."</p>
<p>"You will be very welcome," answered Dorothy, "for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily."</p>
<p>"They really are," said the Lion, "but that doesn't make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy."</p>
<p>So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy's side. Toto did not approve this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion's great jaws. But after a time he became more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.</p>
<p>During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.</p>
<p>"This will serve me a lesson," said he, "to look where I step. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak."</p>
<p>Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.</p>
<p>"You people with hearts," he said, "have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn't mind so much."</p>

<h2 class="c2" id="dlepubid00013">7. The Journey to the Great Oz</h2>
<p>They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.</p>
<p>"If you wish," said the Lion, "I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast."</p>
<p>"Don't! Please don't," begged the Tin Woodman. "I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again."</p>
<p>But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.</p>
<p>When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.</p>
<p>This was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end.</p>
<p>"What shall we do?" asked Dorothy despairingly.</p>
<p>"I haven't the faintest idea," said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>But the Scarecrow said, "We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we climb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where we are."</p>
<p>"I think I could jump over it," said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring the distance carefully in his mind.</p>
<p>"Then we are all right," answered the Scarecrow, "for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll try it," said the Lion. "Who will go first?"</p>
<p>"I will," declared the Scarecrow, "for, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all."</p>
<p>"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself," said the Cowardly Lion, "but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we will make the attempt."</p>
