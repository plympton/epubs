<p>Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn't generly have but one hinge&#8212;a leather one. Some of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus's time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.</p>
<p>All the stores was along one street. &#160;They had white domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts. There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching&#8212;a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words. &#160;There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. &#160;What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was:</p>
<p>"Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank."</p>
<p>"Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left. &#160;Ask Bill."</p>
<p>Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own. &#160;They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, "I wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had"&#8212;which is a lie pretty much everytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no stranger, so he says:</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> give him a chaw, did you? &#160;So did your sister's cat's grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me, Lafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won't charge you no back intrust, nuther."</p>
<p>"Well, I <i>did</i> pay you back some of it wunst."</p>
<p>"Yes, you did&#8212;'bout six chaws. &#160;You borry'd store tobacker and paid back nigger-head."</p>
<p>Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. &#160;When they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed back, and says, sarcastic:</p>
<p>"Here, gimme the <i>chaw</i>, and you take the <i>plug</i>."</p>
<p>All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else <i>but</i> mud&#8212;mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in <i>all</i> the places. &#160;The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. &#160;You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out, "Hi! &#160;<i>so</i> boy! sick him, Tige!" and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. &#160;Then they'd settle back again till there was a dog fight. &#160;There couldn't anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog fight&#8212;unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.</p>
<p>On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in, The people had moved out of them. &#160;The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. &#160;People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. &#160;Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.</p>
<p>The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. &#160;Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them in the wagons. &#160;There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I seen three fights. &#160;By and by somebody sings out:</p>
<p>"Here comes old Boggs!&#8212;in from the country for his little old monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!"</p>
<p>All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs. &#160;One of them says:</p>
<p>"Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time. &#160;If he'd a-chawed up all the men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have considerable ruputation now."</p>
<p>Another one says, "I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd know I warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year."</p>
<p>Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an Injun, and singing out:</p>
<p>"Cler the track, thar. &#160;I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise."</p>
<p>He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old, and had a very red face. &#160;Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now because he'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, "Meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on."</p>
<p>He see me, and rode up and says:</p>
<p>"Whar'd you come f'm, boy? &#160;You prepared to die?"</p>
<p>Then he rode on. &#160;I was scared, but a man says:</p>
<p>"He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when he's drunk. &#160;He's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw&#8212;never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober."</p>
<p>Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:</p>
<p>"Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled. You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!"</p>
<p>And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on. &#160;By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five&#8212;and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town, too&#8212;steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. &#160;He says to Boggs, mighty ca'm and slow&#8212;he says:</p>
<p>"I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock. &#160;Till one o'clock, mind&#8212;no longer. &#160;If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you."</p>
<p>Then he turns and goes in. &#160;The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody stirred, and there warn't no more laughing. &#160;Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up. &#160;Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he <i>must</i> go home&#8212;he must go right away. &#160;But it didn't do no good. &#160;He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use&#8212;up the street he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. &#160;By and by somebody says:</p>
<p>"Go for his daughter!&#8212;quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll listen to her. &#160;If anybody can persuade him, she can."</p>
<p>So somebody started on a run. &#160;I walked down street a ways and stopped. In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his horse. &#160;He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself. &#160;Somebody sings out:</p>
<p>"Boggs!"</p>
<p>I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in his right hand&#8212;not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky. &#160;The same second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with her. &#160;Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level&#8212;both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says, "O Lord, don't shoot!" &#160;Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back, clawing at the air&#8212;bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. &#160;That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, "Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!" &#160;The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting, "Back, back! give him air, give him air!"</p>
<p>Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned around on his heels and walked off.</p>
<p>They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. &#160;They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. &#160;He made about a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out&#8212;and after that he laid still; he was dead. &#160;Then they pulled his daughter away from him, screaming and crying, and took her off. &#160;She was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.</p>
<p>Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was saying all the time, "Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows; 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as you."</p>
<p>There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there was going to be trouble. &#160;The streets was full, and everybody was excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening. &#160;One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, "Boggs!" and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says "Bang!" staggered backwards, says "Bang!" again, and fell down flat on his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened. &#160;Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.</p>
<p>Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. &#160;In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.</p>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p>THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see. &#160;Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach. &#160;Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death.</p>
<p>They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise. &#160;It was a little twenty-foot yard. &#160;Some sung out "Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!" &#160;Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.</p>
<p>Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word. &#160;The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.</p>
<p>Sherburn never said a word&#8212;just stood there, looking down. &#160;The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. &#160;Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand in it.</p>
<p>Then he says, slow and scornful:</p>
<p>"The idea of <i>you</i> lynching anybody! &#160;It's amusing. &#160;The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a <i>man</i>! &#160;Because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a <i>man</i>? &#160;Why, a <i>man's</i> safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind&#8212;as long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.</p>
<p>"Do I know you? &#160;I know you clear through was born and raised in the South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average man's a coward. &#160;In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. &#160;Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people&#8212;whereas you're just <i>as</i> brave, and no braver. &#160;Why don't your juries hang murderers? &#160;Because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark&#8212;and it's just what they <i>would</i> do.</p>
<p>"So they always acquit; and then a <i>man</i> goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. &#160;Your mistake is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks. &#160;You brought <i>part</i> of a man&#8212;Buck Harkness, there&#8212;and if you hadn't had him to start you, you'd a taken it out in blowing.</p>
<p>"You didn't want to come. &#160;The average man don't like trouble and danger. <i>You</i> don't like trouble and danger. &#160;But if only <i>half</i> a man&#8212;like Buck Harkness, there&#8212;shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!' you're afraid to back down&#8212;afraid you'll be found out to be what you are&#8212;<i>cowards</i>&#8212;and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man's coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is&#8212;a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. &#160;But a mob without any <i>man</i> at the head of it is <i>beneath</i> pitifulness. &#160;Now the thing for <i>you</i> to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. &#160;If any real lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll bring their masks, and fetch a <i>man</i> along. &#160;Now <i>leave</i>&#8212;and take your half-a-man with you"&#8212;tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this.</p>
<p>The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap. &#160;I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.</p>
<p>I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent. &#160;I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that way. &#160;You can't be too careful. &#160;I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but there ain't no use in <i>wasting</i> it on them.</p>
<p>It was a real bully circus. &#160;It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable&#8212;there must a been twenty of them&#8212;and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. &#160;It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely. &#160;And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.</p>
<p>And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip and shouting "Hi!&#8212;hi!" and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! &#160;And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.</p>
<p>Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. &#160;The ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever <i>could</i> think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year. And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring&#8212;said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. &#160;They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. &#160;Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, "Knock him down! throw him out!" and one or two women begun to scream. &#160;So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. &#160;So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. &#160;And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. &#160;It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. &#160;But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire too. &#160;He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his life&#8212;and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. &#160;He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum&#8212;and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.</p>
<p>Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he <i>was</i> the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. &#160;Why, it was one of his own men! &#160;He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't a been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars. &#160;I don't know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for <i>me</i>; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of <i>my</i> custom every time.</p>
<p>Well, that night we had <i>our</i> show; but there warn't only about twelve people there&#8212;just enough to pay expenses. &#160;And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. &#160;So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy&#8212;and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. &#160;He said he could size their style. &#160;So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. &#160;The bills said:</p>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p>WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time. &#160;When the place couldn't hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. &#160;And&#8212;but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.</p>
<p>Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it.</p>
<p>Twenty people sings out:</p>
<p>"What, is it over? &#160;Is that <i>all</i>?"</p>
<p>The duke says yes. &#160;Then there was a fine time. &#160;Everybody sings out, "Sold!" and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians. &#160;But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:</p>
<p>"Hold on! &#160;Just a word, gentlemen." &#160;They stopped to listen. &#160;"We are sold&#8212;mighty badly sold. &#160;But we don't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live. &#160;<i>No</i>. &#160;What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the <i>rest</i> of the town! &#160;Then we'll all be in the same boat. &#160;Ain't that sensible?" ("You bet it is!&#8212;the jedge is right!" everybody sings out.) "All right, then&#8212;not a word about any sell. &#160;Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy."</p>
<p>Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was. &#160;House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way. &#160;When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.</p>
<p>The third night the house was crammed again&#8212;and they warn't new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights. &#160;I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat&#8212;and I see it warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. &#160;I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four of them went in. &#160;I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn't stand it. &#160;Well, when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:</p>
<p>"Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you!"</p>
<p>I done it, and he done the same. &#160;We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:</p>
<p>"Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?" &#160;He hadn't been up-town at all.</p>
<p>We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people. &#160;The duke says:</p>
<p>"Greenhorns, flatheads! &#160;I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us the third night, and consider it was <i>their</i> turn now. &#160;Well, it <i>is</i> their turn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it. &#160;I <i>would</i> just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity. &#160;They can turn it into a picnic if they want to&#8212;they brought plenty provisions."</p>
<p>Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. &#160;I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before. &#160;By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:</p>
<p>"Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"</p>
<p>"No," I says, "it don't."</p>
<p>"Why don't it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Well, it don't, because it's in the breed. &#160;I reckon they're all alike."</p>
<p>"But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions."</p>
<p>"Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out."</p>
<p>"Is dat so?"</p>
<p>"You read about them once&#8212;you'll see. &#160;Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to <i>him</i>. &#160;And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. &#160;My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. &#160;He <i>was</i> a blossom. &#160;He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. &#160;And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. &#160;'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says. &#160;They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' &#160;And they chop it off. &#160;'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'&#8212;and they chop it off. &#160;'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' &#160;Fair Rosamun answers the bell. &#160;Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' &#160;And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book&#8212;which was a good name and stated the case. &#160;You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. &#160;Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it&#8212;give notice?&#8212;give the country a show? &#160;No. &#160;All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. &#160;That was <i>his</i> style&#8212;he never give anybody a chance. &#160;He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. &#160;Well, what did he do? &#160;Ask him to show up? &#160;No&#8212;drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. &#160;S'pose people left money laying around where he was&#8212;what did he do? &#160;He collared it. &#160;S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set down there and see that he done it&#8212;what did he do? &#160;He always done the other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth&#8212;what then? &#160;If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time. &#160;That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. &#160;I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing to <i>that</i> old ram, anyway. &#160;All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. &#160;Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised."</p>
<p>"But dis one do <i>smell</i> so like de nation, Huck."</p>
<p>"Well, they all do, Jim. &#160;We can't help the way a king smells; history don't tell no way."</p>
<p>"Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways."</p>
<p>"Yes, a duke's different. &#160;But not very different. &#160;This one's a middling hard lot for a duke. &#160;When he's drunk there ain't no near-sighted man could tell him from a king."</p>
<p>"Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck. &#160;Dese is all I kin stan'."</p>
<p>"It's the way I feel, too, Jim. &#160;But we've got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. &#160;Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings."</p>
<p>What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes? &#160;It wouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: &#160;you couldn't tell them from the real kind.</p>
<p>I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. &#160;He often done that. &#160;When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. &#160;I didn't take notice nor let on. &#160;I knowed what it was about. &#160;He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n. &#160;It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so. &#160;He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it's mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!" &#160;He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.</p>
<p>But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones; and by and by he says:</p>
<p>"What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery. &#160;She warn't on'y 'bout fo' year ole, en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but she got well, en one day she was a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, I says:</p>
<p>"'Shet de do'.'</p>
<p>"She never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me. &#160;It make me mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:</p>
<p>"'Doan' you hear me? &#160;Shet de do'!'</p>
<p>"She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up. &#160;I was a-bilin'! &#160;I says:</p>
<p>"'I lay I <i>make</i> you mine!'</p>
<p>"En wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin'. Den I went into de yuther room, en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes; en when I come back dah was dat do' a-stannin' open <i>yit</i>, en dat chile stannin' mos' right in it, a-lookin' down and mournin', en de tears runnin' down. &#160;My, but I <i>wuz</i> mad! &#160;I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis' den&#8212;it was a do' dat open innerds&#8212;jis' den, 'long come de wind en slam it to, behine de chile, ker-BLAM!&#8212;en my lan', de chile never move'! &#160;My breff mos' hop outer me; en I feel so&#8212;so&#8212;I doan' know HOW I feel. &#160;I crope out, all a-tremblin', en crope aroun' en open de do' easy en slow, en poke my head in behine de chile, sof' en still, en all uv a sudden I says POW! jis' as loud as I could yell. &#160;<i>She never budge!</i> &#160;Oh, Huck, I bust out a-cryin' en grab her up in my arms, en say, 'Oh, de po' little thing! &#160;De Lord God Amighty fogive po' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long's he live!' &#160;Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb deef en dumb&#8212;en I'd ben a-treat'n her so!"</p>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p>NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. &#160;Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. &#160;You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it <i>was</i> kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.</p>
<p>He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. &#160;He dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit&#8212;it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days. &#160;Blamed if he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. &#160;Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:</p>
<p>Sick Arab&#8212;but harmless when not out of his head.</p>
<p>And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. &#160;Jim was satisfied. &#160;He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound. &#160;The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. &#160;Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. &#160;Why, he didn't only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.</p>
<p>These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time. &#160;They couldn't hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way&#8212;meaning the devil, I reckon. &#160;We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. &#160;I done it, of course. &#160;The king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. &#160;I never knowed how clothes could change a body before. &#160;Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. &#160;Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. &#160;There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above the town&#8212;been there a couple of hours, taking on freight. &#160;Says the king:</p>
<p>"Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. &#160;Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her."</p>
<p>I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. &#160;I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. &#160;Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.</p>
<p>"Run her nose in shore," says the king. &#160;I done it. &#160;"Wher' you bound for, young man?"</p>
<p>"For the steamboat; going to Orleans."</p>
<p>"Git aboard," says the king. &#160;"Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p you with them bags. &#160;Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus"&#8212;meaning me, I see.</p>
<p>I done so, and then we all three started on again. &#160;The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. &#160;The young fellow says:</p>
<p>"When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.' &#160;But then I says again, 'No, I reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' &#160;You <i>ain't</i> him, are you?"</p>
<p>"No, my name's Blodgett&#8212;Elexander Blodgett&#8212;<i>Reverend</i> Elexander Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants. &#160;But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it&#8212;which I hope he hasn't."</p>
<p>"Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die&#8212;which he mayn't mind, nobody can tell as to that&#8212;but his brother would a give anything in this world to see <i>him</i> before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys together&#8212;and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all&#8212;that's the deef and dumb one&#8212;William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. &#160;Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. &#160;Harvey and William's the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here in time."</p>
<p>"Did anybody send 'em word?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem to care much to live. &#160;He most desperately wanted to see Harvey&#8212;and William, too, for that matter&#8212;because he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will. &#160;He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he'd told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right&#8212;for George didn't leave nothing. &#160;And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to."</p>
<p>"Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? &#160;Wher' does he live?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he lives in England&#8212;Sheffield&#8212;preaches there&#8212;hasn't ever been in this country. &#160;He hasn't had any too much time&#8212;and besides he mightn't a got the letter at all, you know."</p>
<p>"Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. &#160;I'm going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives."</p>
<p>"It's a pretty long journey. &#160;But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? &#160;How old is the others?"</p>
<p>"Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about fourteen&#8212;that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip."</p>
<p>"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so."</p>
<p>"Well, they could be worse off. &#160;Old Peter had friends, and they ain't going to let them come to no harm. &#160;There's Hobson, the Babtis' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and&#8212;well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here."</p>
