<p>Night came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst of the roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda ruined Gour, Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to see his country's flag flying, were hidden from their view in the darkness.</p>
<p>Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him.</p>
<p>According to his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival. He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time. The two days gained between London and Bombay had been lost, as has been seen, in the journey across India. But it is not to be supposed that Phileas Fogg regretted them.</p>

<h3 class="c2" id="dlepubid00032">Chapter XV</h3>
<h4 class="c4" id="dlepubid00033">IN WHICH THE BAG OF BANKNOTES DISGORGES SOME THOUSANDS OF POUNDS MORE</h4>
<p>The train entered the station, and Passepartout jumping out first, was followed by Mr. Fogg, who assisted his fair companion to descend. Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer, in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage. He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground.</p>
<p>Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him, and said, "Mr. Phileas Fogg?"</p>
<p>"I am he."</p>
<p>"Is this man your servant?" added the policeman, pointing to Passepartout.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Be so good, both of you, as to follow me."</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever. The policeman was a representative of the law, and law is sacred to an Englishman. Passepartout tried to reason about the matter, but the policeman tapped him with his stick, and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey.</p>
<p>"May this young lady go with us?" asked he.</p>
<p>"She may," replied the policeman.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri, a sort of four-wheeled carriage, drawn by two horses, in which they took their places and were driven away. No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination. They first passed through the "black town," with its narrow streets, its miserable, dirty huts, and squalid population; then through the "European town," which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions, shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts, where, although it was early morning, elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth.</p>
<p>The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which, however, did not have the appearance of a private mansion. The policeman having requested his prisoners&#8212;for so, truly, they might be called&#8212;to descend, conducted them into a room with barred windows, and said: "You will appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight."</p>
<p>He then retired, and closed the door.</p>
<p>"Why, we are prisoners!" exclaimed Passepartout, falling into a chair.</p>
<p>Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg: "Sir, you must leave me to my fate! It is on my account that you receive this treatment, it is for having saved me!"</p>
<p>Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible. It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee. The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge. There was some mistake. Moreover, he would not, in any event, abandon Aouda, but would escort her to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"But the steamer leaves at noon!" observed Passepartout, nervously.</p>
<p>"We shall be on board by noon," replied his master, placidly.</p>
<p>It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to himself, "Parbleu that's certain! Before noon we shall be on board." But he was by no means reassured.</p>
<p>At half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and, requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall. It was evidently a court-room, and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk. Immediately after, Judge Obadiah, a fat, round man, followed by the clerk, entered. He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail, and put it hurriedly on his head.</p>
<p>"The first case," said he. Then, putting his hand to his head, he exclaimed, "Heh! This is not my wig!"</p>
<p>"No, your worship," returned the clerk, "it is mine."</p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Oysterpuff, how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk's wig?"</p>
<p>The wigs were exchanged.</p>
<p>Passepartout was getting nervous, for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity.</p>
<p>"The first case," repeated Judge Obadiah.</p>
<p>"Phileas Fogg?" demanded Oysterpuff.</p>
<p>"I am here," replied Mr. Fogg.</p>
<p>"Passepartout?"</p>
<p>"Present," responded Passepartout.</p>
<p>"Good," said the judge. "You have been looked for, prisoners, for two days on the trains from Bombay."</p>
<p>"But of what are we accused?" asked Passepartout, impatiently.</p>
<p>"You are about to be informed."</p>
<p>"I am an English subject, sir," said Mr. Fogg, "and I have the right&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Have you been ill-treated?"</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>"Very well; let the complainants come in."</p>
<p>A door was swung open by order of the judge, and three Indian priests entered.</p>
<p>"That's it," muttered Passepartout; "these are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady."</p>
<p>The priests took their places in front of the judge, and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against Phileas Fogg and his servant, who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion.</p>
<p>"You hear the charge?" asked the judge.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," replied Mr. Fogg, consulting his watch, "and I admit it."</p>
<p>"You admit it?"</p>
<p>"I admit it, and I wish to hear these priests admit, in their turn, what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji."</p>
<p>The priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what was said.</p>
<p>"Yes," cried Passepartout, warmly; "at the pagoda of Pillaji, where they were on the point of burning their victim."</p>
<p>The judge stared with astonishment, and the priests were stupefied.</p>
<p>"What victim?" said Judge Obadiah. "Burn whom? In Bombay itself?"</p>
<p>"Bombay?" cried Passepartout.</p>
<p>"Certainly. We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, but of the pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay."</p>
<p>"And as a proof," added the clerk, "here are the desecrator's very shoes, which he left behind him."</p>
<p>Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk.</p>
<p>"My shoes!" cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him.</p>
<p>The confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the affair at Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta, may be imagined.</p>
<p>Fix the detective, had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout's escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for twelve hours, had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill. Knowing that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, he promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train. Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive. Fix's disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined. He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces. For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive, accompanied by a young woman, whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain. He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah.</p>
<p>Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room, watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done at Bombay and Suez.</p>
<p>Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout's rash exclamation, which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall.</p>
<p>"The facts are admitted?" asked the judge.</p>
<p>"Admitted," replied Mr. Fogg, coldly.</p>
<p>"Inasmuch," resumed the judge, "as the English law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds."</p>
<p>"Three hundred pounds!" cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness of the sum.</p>
<p>"Silence!" shouted the constable.</p>
<p>"And inasmuch," continued the judge, "as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds."</p>
<p>Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive. Passepartout was stupefied. This sentence ruined his master. A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!</p>
<p>Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced. Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and said, "I offer bail."</p>
<p>"You have that right," returned the judge.</p>
<p>Fix's blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds.</p>
<p>"I will pay it at once," said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on the clerk's desk.</p>
<p>"This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison," said the judge. "Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail."</p>
<p>"Come!" said Phileas Fogg to his servant.</p>
<p>"But let them at least give me back my shoes!" cried Passepartout angrily.</p>
<p>"Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!" he muttered, as they were handed to him. "More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet."</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the crestfallen Passepartout. Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr. Fogg's traces. That gentleman took a carriage, and the party were soon landed on one of the quays.</p>
<p>The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head. Eleven o'clock was striking; Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time. Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with disappointment.</p>
<p>"The rascal is off, after all!" he exclaimed. "Two thousand pounds sacrificed! He's as prodigal as a thief! I'll follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted."</p>
<p>The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture. Since leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way, and the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives, was rapidly diminishing.</p>
<p><br><br><br><a id="chap16"></a></p>
<h3 class="c2" id="dlepubid00034">Chapter XVI</h3>
<h4 class="c4" id="dlepubid00035">IN WHICH FIX DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST WHAT IS SAID TO HIM</h4>
<p>The Rangoon&#8212;one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's boats plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas&#8212;was a screw steamer, built of iron, weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons, and with engines of four hundred horse-power. She was as fast, but not as well fitted up, as the Mongolia, and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished. However, the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not difficult to please.</p>
<p>During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done. The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her, apparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda's comfort. He visited her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself, as to sit and hear her talk. He treated her with the strictest politeness, but with the precision of an automaton, the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose. Aouda did not quite know what to make of him, though Passepartout had given her some hints of his master's eccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world. After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life, and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude.</p>
<p>Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching history. She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India. Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet by the English government. Aouda was a relative of this great man, and it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong. Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr. Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything would be mathematically&#8212;he used the very word&#8212;arranged. Aouda fastened her great eyes, "clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya," upon him; but the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake.</p>
<p>The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid favourable weather and propitious winds, and they soon came in sight of the great Andaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal, with its picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four hundred feet high, looming above the waters. The steamer passed along near the shores, but the savage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not, as has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance.</p>
<p>The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb. Vast forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and tree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire. The varied landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave access to the China seas.</p>
<p>What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country, doing all this while? He had managed to embark on the Rangoon at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that, if the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage. It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening Passepartout's suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay. But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant, as will be seen.</p>
<p>All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for the steamer's stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there. The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the robber would probably escape him for ever. Hong Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan, America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge. If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no further trouble. But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result in delays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice.</p>
<p>Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, "Now, either the warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure. I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed at Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost: Cost what it may, I must succeed! But how shall I prevent his departure, if that should turn out to be my last resource?"</p>
<p>Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg's accomplice, he was very certain. The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an ally of the detective. But this method was a dangerous one, only to be employed when everything else had failed. A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin all. The detective was therefore in a sore strait. But suddenly a new idea struck him. The presence of Aouda on the Rangoon, in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for reflection.</p>
<p>Who was this woman? What combination of events had made her Fogg's travelling companion? They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta; but where? Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel? Fix was fairly puzzled. He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue. Whether the young woman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money.</p>
<p>But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong? Fogg had an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before anything could be effected, might get full under way again for Yokohama.</p>
<p>Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal the Rangoon before her arrival. This was easy to do, since the steamer stopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong. He finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to question Passepartout. It would not be difficult to make him talk; and, as there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to make himself known.</p>
<p>It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the Rangoon was due at Singapore.</p>
<p>Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck. Passepartout was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer. The detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise, and exclaimed, "You here, on the Rangoon?"</p>
<p>"What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?" returned the really astonished Passepartout, recognising his crony of the Mongolia. "Why, I left you at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong! Are you going round the world too?"</p>
<p>"No, no," replied Fix; "I shall stop at Hong Kong&#8212;at least for some days."</p>
<p>"Hum!" said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed. "But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a trifle of sea-sickness&#8212;I've been staying in my berth. The Gulf of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean. And how is Mr. Fogg?"</p>
<p>"As well and as punctual as ever, not a day behind time! But, Monsieur Fix, you don't know that we have a young lady with us."</p>
<p>"A young lady?" replied the detective, not seeming to comprehend what was said.</p>
<p>Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda's history, the affair at the Bombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds, the rescue, the arrest, and sentence of the Calcutta court, and the restoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail. Fix, who was familiar with the last events, seemed to be equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener.</p>
<p>"But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. We are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong."</p>
<p>"Nothing to be done there," said Fix to himself, concealing his disappointment. "A glass of gin, Mr. Passepartout?"</p>
<p>"Willingly, Monsieur Fix. We must at least have a friendly glass on board the Rangoon."</p>
<p><br><br><br><a id="chap17"></a></p>
<h3 class="c2" id="dlepubid00036">Chapter XVII</h3>
<h4 class="c4" id="dlepubid00037">SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED ON THE VOYAGE FROM SINGAPORE TO HONG KONG</h4>
<p>The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview, though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg. He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his inveterate habit, took a hand at whist.</p>
<p>Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board the Mongolia, who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the Rangoon, was following Mr. Fogg's tracks step by step. What was Fix's object? Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes&#8212;which he religiously preserved&#8212;that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them, and probably on the same steamer.</p>
<p>Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe. But, as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of Fix's movements, which was in truth far from unreasonable. Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg's friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon.</p>
<p>"It's clear!" repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his shrewdness. "He's a spy sent to keep us in view! That isn't quite the thing, either, to be spying Mr. Fogg, who is so honourable a man! Ah, gentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!"</p>
<p>Passepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say nothing to his master, lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the part of his adversaries. But he determined to chaff Fix, when he had the chance, with mysterious allusions, which, however, need not betray his real suspicions.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon entered the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from Sumatra. The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers. The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal, having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival. Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked.</p>
<p>Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg's every movement, followed them cautiously, without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his sleeve at Fix's manoeuvres, went about his usual errands.</p>
<p>The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions. It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome carriage, drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower. Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields; sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume. Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles.</p>
<p>After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking, irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked, closely followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight.</p>
<p>Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes&#8212;a fruit as large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords gourmands a delicious sensation&#8212;was waiting for them on deck. He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very gracefully for them.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view. Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of Hong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast. Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for Yokohama, the principal Japanese port.</p>
<p>The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked at Singapore, among them a number of Indians, Ceylonese, Chinamen, Malays, and Portuguese, mostly second-class travellers.</p>
<p>The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last quarter of the moon. The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus aided the steamer's progress. The captain as often as possible put up his sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China. Owing to the defective construction of the Rangoon, however, unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least. Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows. Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly burning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot impatience.</p>
<p>"You are in a great hurry, then," said Fix to him one day, "to reach Hong Kong?"</p>
<p>"A very great hurry!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Fogg, I suppose, is anxious to catch the steamer for Yokohama?"</p>
<p>"Terribly anxious."</p>
<p>"You believe in this journey around the world, then?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. Don't you, Mr. Fix?"</p>
<p>"I? I don't believe a word of it."</p>
<p>"You're a sly dog!" said Passepartout, winking at him.</p>
<p>This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why. Had the Frenchman guessed his real purpose? He knew not what to think. But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective? Yet, in speaking as he did, the man evidently meant more than he expressed.</p>
<p>Passepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his tongue.</p>
<p>"Mr. Fix," said he, in a bantering tone, "shall we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to Hong Kong?"</p>
<p>"Why," responded Fix, a little embarrassed, "I don't know; perhaps&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Ah, if you would only go on with us! An agent of the Peninsular Company, you know, can't stop on the way! You were only going to Bombay, and here you are in China. America is not far off, and from America to Europe is only a step."</p>
<p>Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene as possible, and laughed with him. But Passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation.</p>
<p>"Yes, and no," returned Fix; "there is good and bad luck in such things. But you must understand that I don't travel at my own expense."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am quite sure of that!" cried Passepartout, laughing heartily.</p>
<p>Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections. He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective. But had he told his master? What part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or not? Was the game, then, up? Fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then undecided what course it was best to take.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout. If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell Passepartout all. Either the servant was the accomplice of his master, and in this case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his interest would be to abandon the robber.</p>
<p>Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout. Meanwhile Phileas Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference. He was passing methodically in his orbit around the world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him. Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star, which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman's heart. But no! the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout's great surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune.</p>
<p>It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in Aouda's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless. As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries.</p>
<p>One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant.</p>
<p>"The valves are not sufficiently charged!" he exclaimed. "We are not going. Oh, these English! If this was an American craft, we should blow up, perhaps, but we should at all events go faster!"</p>

<h4 class="c4" id="dlepubid00039">IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG, PASSEPARTOUT, AND FIX GO EACH ABOUT HIS BUSINESS</h4>
<p>The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage. The wind, obstinately remaining in the north-west, blew a gale, and retarded the steamer. The Rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long, monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path. A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November, the squall knocking the vessel about with fury, and the waves running high. The Rangoon reefed all her sails, and even the rigging proved too much, whistling and shaking amid the squall. The steamer was forced to proceed slowly, and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time, and more if the storm lasted.</p>
<p>Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea, which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him, with his habitual tranquillity. He never changed countenance for an instant, though a delay of twenty hours, by making him too late for the Yokohama boat, would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager. But this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme, and had been foreseen. Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him.</p>
<p>Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light. The storm greatly pleased him. His satisfaction would have been complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves. Each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies, with the gusts and squalls. It mattered not that they made him sea-sick&#8212;he made no account of this inconvenience; and, whilst his body was writhing under their effects, his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation.</p>
<p>Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather. Everything had gone so well till now! Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master's service; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam united to speed his journey. Had the hour of adversity come? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket. The storm exasperated him, the gale made him furious, and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience. Poor fellow! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction, for, had he betrayed it, Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence.</p>
<p>Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted, being unable to remain quiet below, and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew. He overwhelmed the captain, officers, and sailors, who could not help laughing at his impatience, with all sorts of questions. He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last; whereupon he was referred to the barometer, which seemed to have no intention of rising. Passepartout shook it, but with no perceptible effect; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind.</p>
<p>On the 4th, however, the sea became more calm, and the storm lessened its violence; the wind veered southward, and was once more favourable. Passepartout cleared up with the weather. Some of the sails were unfurled, and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid speed. The time lost could not, however, be regained. Land was not signalled until five o'clock on the morning of the 6th; the steamer was due on the 5th. Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand, and the Yokohama steamer would, of course, be missed.</p>
<p>The pilot went on board at six, and took his place on the bridge, to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong Kong. Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama; but he dared not, for he wished to preserve the spark of hope, which still remained till the last moment. He had confided his anxiety to Fix who&#8212;the sly rascal!&#8212;tried to console him by saying that Mr. Fogg would be in time if he took the next boat; but this only put Passepartout in a passion.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg, bolder than his servant, did not hesitate to approach the pilot, and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave Hong Kong for Yokohama.</p>
<p>"At high tide to-morrow morning," answered the pilot.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Fogg, without betraying any astonishment.</p>
<p>Passepartout, who heard what passed, would willingly have embraced the pilot, while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck.</p>
<p>"What is the steamer's name?" asked Mr. Fogg.</p>
<p>"The Carnatic."</p>
<p>"Ought she not to have gone yesterday?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; but they had to repair one of her boilers, and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Thank you," returned Mr. Fogg, descending mathematically to the saloon.</p>
<p>Passepartout clasped the pilot's hand and shook it heartily in his delight, exclaiming, "Pilot, you are the best of good fellows!"</p>
<p>The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting. He remounted the bridge, and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks, tankas, and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>At one o'clock the Rangoon was at the quay, and the passengers were going ashore.</p>
<p>Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg, for had not the Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers, she would have left on the 6th of November, and the passengers for Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer. Mr. Fogg was, it is true, twenty-four hours behind his time; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour.</p>
<p>The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong, and it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama; and if Mr. Fogg was twenty-four hours late on reaching Yokohama, this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific. He found himself, then, about twenty-four hours behind-hand, thirty-five days after leaving London.</p>
<p>The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next morning. Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there, which was to deposit Aouda safely with her wealthy relative.</p>
<p>On landing, he conducted her to a palanquin, in which they repaired to the Club Hotel. A room was engaged for the young woman, and Mr. Fogg, after seeing that she wanted for nothing, set out in search of her cousin Jeejeeh. He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return, that Aouda might not be left entirely alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange, where, he did not doubt, every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee merchant. Meeting a broker, he made the inquiry, to learn that Jeejeeh had left China two years before, and, retiring from business with an immense fortune, had taken up his residence in Europe&#8212;in Holland the broker thought, with the merchants of which country he had principally traded. Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel, begged a moment's conversation with Aouda, and without more ado, apprised her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong, but probably in Holland.</p>
<p>Aouda at first said nothing. She passed her hand across her forehead, and reflected a few moments. Then, in her sweet, soft voice, she said: "What ought I to do, Mr. Fogg?"</p>
<p>"It is very simple," responded the gentleman. "Go on to Europe."</p>
<p>"But I cannot intrude&#8212;"</p>
<p>"You do not intrude, nor do you in the least embarrass my project. Passepartout!"</p>
<p>"Monsieur."</p>
<p>"Go to the Carnatic, and engage three cabins."</p>
<p>Passepartout, delighted that the young woman, who was very gracious to him, was going to continue the journey with them, went off at a brisk gait to obey his master's order.</p>
<p><br><br><br><a id="chap19"></a></p>
<h3 class="c2" id="dlepubid00040">Chapter XIX</h3>
<h4 class="c4" id="dlepubid00041">IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TAKES A TOO GREAT INTEREST IN HIS MASTER,<br>
AND WHAT COMES OF IT</h4>
<p>Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by the Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port. The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite coast. Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade, and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place. Docks, hospitals, wharves, a Gothic cathedral, a government house, macadamised streets, give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes.</p>
<p>Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets. Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy. At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations: English, French, American, and Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels, Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas, tankas, and flower-boats, which formed so many floating parterres. Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On going into a barber's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow, which is the Imperial colour. Passepartout, without exactly knowing why, thought this very funny.</p>
<p>On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic, he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed.</p>
<p>"This is bad," muttered Passepartout, "for the gentlemen of the Reform Club!" He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had not perceived that gentleman's chagrin. The detective had, indeed, good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him. The warrant had not come! It was certainly on the way, but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for several days; and, this being the last English territory on Mr. Fogg's route, the robber would escape, unless he could manage to detain him.</p>
<p>"Well, Monsieur Fix," said Passepartout, "have you decided to go with us so far as America?"</p>
<p>"Yes," returned Fix, through his set teeth.</p>
<p>"Good!" exclaimed Passepartout, laughing heartily. "I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us. Come and engage your berth."</p>
<p>They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons. The clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them that, the repairs on the Carnatic having been completed, the steamer would leave that very evening, and not next morning, as had been announced.</p>
<p>"That will suit my master all the better," said Passepartout. "I will go and let him know."</p>
<p>Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout all. It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong. He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay. On entering, they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep. At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots.</p>
<p>Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds&#8212;thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found themselves. Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time.</p>
<p>They ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did ample justice, whilst Fix observed him with close attention. They chatted about the journey, and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them. When the bottles were empty, however, he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the Carnatic.</p>
<p>Fix caught him by the arm, and said, "Wait a moment."</p>
<p>"What for, Mr. Fix?"</p>
<p>"I want to have a serious talk with you."</p>
<p>"A serious talk!" cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass. "Well, we'll talk about it to-morrow; I haven't time now."</p>
<p>"Stay! What I have to say concerns your master."</p>
<p>Passepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion. Fix's face seemed to have a singular expression. He resumed his seat.</p>
<p>"What is it that you have to say?"</p>
<p>Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout's arm, and, lowering his voice, said, "You have guessed who I am?"</p>
<p>"Parbleu!" said Passepartout, smiling.</p>
<p>"Then I'm going to tell you everything&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Now that I know everything, my friend! Ah! that's very good. But go on, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense."</p>
<p>"Useless!" said Fix. "You speak confidently. It's clear that you don't know how large the sum is."</p>
<p>"Of course I do," returned Passepartout. "Twenty thousand pounds."</p>
<p>"Fifty-five thousand!" answered Fix, pressing his companion's hand.</p>
<p>"What!" cried the Frenchman. "Has Monsieur Fogg dared&#8212;fifty-five thousand pounds! Well, there's all the more reason for not losing an instant," he continued, getting up hastily.</p>
<p>Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: "Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you'll help me, I'll let you have five hundred of them."</p>
<p>"Help you?" cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open.</p>
<p>"Yes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days."</p>
<p>"Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put obstacles in his way! I blush for them!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!"</p>
<p>"That's just what we count on doing."</p>
<p>"It's a conspiracy, then," cried Passepartout, who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without perceiving it. "A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!"</p>
<p>Fix began to be puzzled.</p>
<p>"Members of the Reform Club!" continued Passepartout. "You must know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes a wager, he tries to win it fairly!"</p>
<p>"But who do you think I am?" asked Fix, looking at him intently.</p>
<p>"Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to interrupt my master's journey. But, though I found you out some time ago, I've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg."</p>
<p>"He knows nothing, then?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass.</p>
<p>The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout's mistake seemed sincere, but it made his design more difficult. It was evident that the servant was not the master's accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect.</p>
<p>"Well," said the detective to himself, "as he is not an accomplice, he will help me."</p>
<p>He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he resolved to make a clean breast of it.</p>
<p>"Listen to me," said Fix abruptly. "I am not, as you think, an agent of the members of the Reform Club&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Bah!" retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery.</p>
<p>"I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office."</p>
<p>"You, a detective?"</p>
<p>"I will prove it. Here is my commission."</p>
<p>Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted.</p>
<p>"Mr. Fogg's wager," resumed Fix, "is only a pretext, of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity."</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>"Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured. Here is his description; it answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg."</p>
<p>"What nonsense!" cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist. "My master is the most honourable of men!"</p>
<p>"How can you tell? You know scarcely anything about him. You went into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in banknotes. And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," repeated the poor fellow, mechanically.</p>
<p>"Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?"</p>
<p>Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his hands, and did not dare to look at the detective. Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber! And yet how many presumptions there were against him! Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you want of me?" said he, at last, with an effort.</p>
<p>"See here," replied Fix; "I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place, but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to London. You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I! But I&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England."</p>
<p>"Never!" replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back, exhausted in mind and body.</p>
<p>"Mr. Fix," he stammered, "even should what you say be true&#8212;if my master is really the robber you are seeking for&#8212;which I deny&#8212;I have been, am, in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and I will never betray him&#8212;not for all the gold in the world. I come from a village where they don't eat that kind of bread!"</p>
<p>"You refuse?"</p>
<p>"I refuse."</p>
<p>"Consider that I've said nothing," said Fix; "and let us drink."</p>
<p>"Yes; let us drink!"</p>
<p>Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout's hand. He took it, put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head, becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.</p>
<p>"At last!" said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. "Mr. Fogg will not be informed of the Carnatic's departure; and, if he is, he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman!"</p>
<p>And, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern.</p>
<p><br><br><br><a id="chap20"></a></p>
<h3 class="c2" id="dlepubid00042">Chapter XX</h3>
<h4 class="c4" id="dlepubid00043">IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG</h4>
<p>While these events were passing at the opium-house, Mr. Fogg, unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was quietly escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them. It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions. He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity, and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who was confused by his patience and generosity:</p>
<p>"It is in the interest of my journey&#8212;a part of my programme."</p>
<p>The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote; after which Aouda, shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion, retired to her room for rest. Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News.</p>
<p>Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime. But, knowing that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did not disturb himself about the matter. When Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his master's bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying the least vexation, contented himself with taking his carpet-bag, calling Aouda, and sending for a palanquin.</p>
<p>It was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide, the Carnatic would leave the harbour. Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow, and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark. Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before. He had expected to find not only the steamer, but his domestic, and was forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face, and he merely remarked to Aouda, "It is an accident, madam; nothing more."</p>
<p>At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached. It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg: "Were you not, like me, sir, a passenger by the Rangoon, which arrived yesterday?"</p>
<p>"I was, sir," replied Mr. Fogg coldly. "But I have not the honour&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here."</p>
<p>"Do you know where he is, sir?" asked Aouda anxiously.</p>
<p>"What!" responded Fix, feigning surprise. "Is he not with you?"</p>
<p>"No," said Aouda. "He has not made his appearance since yesterday. Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us?"</p>
<p>"Without you, madam?" answered the detective. "Excuse me, did you intend to sail in the Carnatic?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed. The Carnatic, its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for another steamer."</p>
<p>As he said "a week" Fix felt his heart leap for joy. Fogg detained at Hong Kong for a week! There would be time for the warrant to arrive, and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law. His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say, in his placid voice, "But there are other vessels besides the Carnatic, it seems to me, in the harbour of Hong Kong."</p>
<p>And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start. Fix, stupefied, followed; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread. Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well. For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail. Fix began to hope again.</p>
<p>But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves.</p>
<p>"Is your honour looking for a boat?"</p>
<p>"Have you a boat ready to sail?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat&#8212;No. 43&#8212;the best in the harbour."</p>
<p>"Does she go fast?"</p>
<p>"Between eight and nine knots the hour. Will you look at her?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Your honour will be satisfied with her. Is it for a sea excursion?"</p>
<p>"No; for a voyage."</p>
<p>"A voyage?"</p>
<p>"Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?"</p>
<p>The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said, "Is your honour joking?"</p>
<p>"No. I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco."</p>
<p>"I am sorry," said the sailor; "but it is impossible."</p>
<p>"I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time."</p>
<p>"Are you in earnest?"</p>
<p>"Very much so."</p>
<p>The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea, evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far. Fix was in mortal suspense.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, "You would not be afraid, would you, madam?"</p>
<p>"Not with you, Mr. Fogg," was her answer.</p>
<p>The pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands.</p>
<p>"Well, pilot?" said Mr. Fogg.</p>
<p>"Well, your honour," replied he, "I could not risk myself, my men, or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year. Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong."</p>
<p>"Only sixteen hundred," said Mr. Fogg.</p>
<p>"It's the same thing."</p>
<p>Fix breathed more freely.</p>
<p>"But," added the pilot, "it might be arranged another way."</p>
<p>Fix ceased to breathe at all.</p>
<p>"How?" asked Mr. Fogg.</p>
<p>"By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us."</p>
<p>"Pilot," said Mr. Fogg, "I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki."</p>
<p>"Why not?" returned the pilot. "The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai."</p>
<p>"You are sure of that?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly."</p>
<p>"And when does the boat leave Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai."</p>
<p>"And you could go&#8212;"</p>
<p>"In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up."</p>
<p>"It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?"</p>
<p>"Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere."</p>
<p>"Would you like some earnest-money?"</p>
<p>"If it would not put your honour out&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Here are two hundred pounds on account sir," added Phileas Fogg, turning to Fix, "if you would like to take advantage&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour."</p>
<p>"Very well. In half an hour we shall go on board."</p>
<p>"But poor Passepartout?" urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the servant's disappearance.</p>
<p>"I shall do all I can to find him," replied Phileas Fogg.</p>
<p>While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat, the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong. Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description, and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him. The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there, they returned to the wharf.</p>
<p>It was now three o'clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.</p>
<p>The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining copper sheathing, her galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid.</p>
<p>Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation was confined, but neat.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you," said Mr. Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding.</p>
<p>The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg.</p>
<p>"It's certain," thought he, "though rascal as he is, he is a polite one!"</p>
<p>The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.</p>
<p>John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the Tankadere, taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves.</p>
