<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha left his father's house feeling even more exhausted and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind too seemed shattered and unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day. He felt something bordering upon despair, which he had never known till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his father and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had himself been a witness of it, he had been present and seen them face to face. Yet only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy, terribly, completely unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It appeared too that there were other people concerned, far more so than Alyosha could have supposed before. There was something positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had made a step towards him, which was what Alyosha had been long desiring. Yet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these women? Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna's in the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind. On the contrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from her. Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult than before. The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably, and Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope, might sink to any depth. He had, moreover, told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the scene which had just taken place with his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was by now seven o'clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by Katerina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg157"></a> two aunts. One of them, a woman of little education, was that aunt of her half-sister Agafya Ivanovna who had looked after her in her father's house when she came from boarding-school. The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and consequence, though in straitened circumstances. It was said that they both gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only kept them with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no one but her benefactress, the general's widow, who had been kept by illness in Moscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice a week a full account of all her doings.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to him to take his name up, it was evident that they were already aware of his arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the window. At least, Alyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustling skirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had run out of the room.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such excitement. He was conducted however to the drawing-room at once. It was a large room, elegantly and amply furnished, not at all in provincial style. There were many sofas, lounges, settees, big and little tables. There were pictures on the walls, vases and lamps on the tables, masses of flowers, and even an aquarium in the window. It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha made out a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently just been sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups of chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another with sweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and frowned. But at that instant the porti&#232;re was raised, and with rapid, hurrying footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out both hands to Alyosha with a radiant smile of delight. At the same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them on the table.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thank God! At last you have come too! I've been simply praying for you all day! Sit down.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna's beauty when, three weeks before, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina Ivanovna's special request, to be introduced to her. There had been no conversation between them at that interview, however. Supposing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg158"></a> Alyosha to be very shy, Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha had been silent, but he had seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck by the imperiousness, proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl. And all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. He thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with her pale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in the lines of her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother might well be passionately in love, but which perhaps could not be loved for long. He expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after the visit, his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal his impressions on seeing his betrothed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You'll be happy with her, but perhaps&#8212;not tranquilly happy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They don't yield to fate. So you think I shan't love her for ever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you won't always be happy with her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry with himself for having yielded to his brother's entreaties and put such <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;foolish&#8221;</span> ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as awfully foolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed too of having given so confident an opinion about a woman. It was with the more amazement that he felt now, at the first glance at Katerina Ivanovna as she ran in to him, that he had perhaps been utterly mistaken. This time her face was beaming with spontaneous good-natured kindliness, and direct warm-hearted sincerity. The <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;pride and haughtiness,&#8221;</span> which had struck Alyosha so much before, was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energy and a sort of bright, strong faith in herself. Alyosha realized at the first glance, at the first word, that all the tragedy of her position in relation to the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her; that she perhaps already knew everything, positively everything. And yet, in spite of that, there was such brightness in her face, such faith in the future. Alyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts. He was conquered and captivated immediately. Besides all this, he noticed at her first words that she was in great excitement, an excitement perhaps quite exceptional and almost approaching ecstasy.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg159"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the whole truth&#8212;from you and no one else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have come,&#8221;</span> muttered Alyosha confusedly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I&#8212;he sent me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know everything&#8212;everything!&#8221;</span> cried Katerina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Wait a moment, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I'll tell you why I've been so longing to see you. You see, I know perhaps far more than you do yourself, and there's no need for you to tell me anything. I'll tell you what I want from you. I want to know your own last impression of him. I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarsely even (oh, as coarsely as you like!), what you thought of him just now and of his position after your meeting with him to-day. That will perhaps be better than if I had a personal explanation with him, as he does not want to come to me. Do you understand what I want from you? Now, tell me simply, tell me every word of the message he sent you with (I knew he would send you).&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He told me to give you his compliments&#8212;and to say that he would never come again&#8212;but to give you his compliments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;His compliments? Was that what he said&#8212;his own expression?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word, perhaps he did not use the right word?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me two or three times not to forget to say so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your help. I'll tell you what I think, and you must simply say whether it's right or not. Listen! If he had sent me his compliments in passing, without insisting on your repeating the words, without emphasizing them, that would be the end of everything! But if he particularly insisted on those words, if he particularly told you not to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps he was in excitement, beside himself. He had made his decision and was frightened at it. He wasn't walking away from me with a resolute step, but leaping headlong. The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply bravado.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha warmly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I believe that is it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And, if so, he's not altogether lost. I can still save him. Stay! <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg160"></a> Did he not tell you anything about money&#8212;about three thousand roubles?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He did speak about it, and it's that more than anything that's crushing him. He said he had lost his honor and that nothing matters now,&#8221;</span> Alyosha answered warmly, feeling a rush of hope in his heart and believing that there really might be a way of escape and salvation for his brother. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But do you know about the money?&#8221;</span> he added, and suddenly broke off.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire, and heard long ago that the money had not arrived. He hadn't sent the money, but I said nothing. Last week I learnt that he was still in need of money. My only object in all this was that he should know to whom to turn, and who was his true friend. No, he won't recognize that I am his truest friend; he won't know me, and looks on me merely as a woman. I've been tormented all the week, trying to think how to prevent him from being ashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let him feel ashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people's knowing, but not of my knowing. He can tell God everything without shame. Why is it he still does not understand how much I am ready to bear for his sake? Why, why doesn't he know me? How dare he not know me after all that has happened? I want to save him for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed. And here he fears that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasn't afraid to be open with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I don't deserve the same?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I must tell you,&#8221;</span> Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;what happened just now between him and my father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to get the money, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and after that had again specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments and farewell. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He went to that woman,&#8221;</span> Alyosha added softly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And do you suppose that I can't put up with that woman? Does he think I can't? But he won't marry her,&#8221;</span> she suddenly laughed nervously. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Could such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov? <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg161"></a> It's passion, not love. He won't marry her because she won't marry him.&#8221;</span> Again Katerina Ivanovna laughed strangely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He may marry her,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He won't marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you know that? Do you know that?&#8221;</span> Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with extraordinary warmth. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures. I know how bewitching she is, but I know too that she is kind, firm and noble. Why do you look at me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you are wondering at my words, perhaps you don't believe me? Agrafena Alexandrovna, my angel!&#8221;</span> she cried suddenly to some one, peeping into the next room, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;come in to us. This is a friend. This is Alyosha. He knows all about our affairs. Show yourself to him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,&#8221;</span> said a soft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The porti&#232;re was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming, came up to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha. He fixed his eyes on her and could not take them off. Here she was, that awful woman, the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;beast,&#8221;</span> as Ivan had called her half an hour before. And yet one would have thought the creature standing before him most simple and ordinary, a good-natured, kind woman, handsome certainly, but so like other handsome ordinary women! It is true she was very, very good-looking with that Russian beauty so passionately loved by many men. She was a rather tall woman, though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who was exceptionally tall. She had a full figure, with soft, as it were, noiseless, movements, softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like her voice. She moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step, but noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor. She sank softly into a low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress, and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders in a costly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old, and her face looked exactly that age. She was very white in the face, with a pale pink tint on her cheeks. The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full, and looked pouting. But her magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored eyebrows <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg162"></a> and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would have made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in the street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after. What struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good nature. There was a childlike look in her eyes, a look of childish delight. She came up to the table, beaming with delight and seeming to expect something with childish, impatient, and confiding curiosity. The light in her eyes gladdened the soul&#8212;Alyosha felt that. There was something else in her which he could not understand, or would not have been able to define, and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him. It was that softness, that voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that catlike noiselessness. Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawl could be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom. Her figure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already in somewhat exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. Connoisseurs of Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this fresh, still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of thirty, would <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;spread&#8221;</span>; that the face would become puffy, and that wrinkles would very soon appear upon her forehead and round the eyes; the complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps&#8212;in fact, that it was the beauty of the moment, the fleeting beauty which is so often met with in Russian women. Alyosha, of course, did not think of this; but though he was fascinated, yet he wondered with an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why she drawled in that way and could not speak naturally. She did so evidently feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation of the syllables. It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that showed bad education and a false idea of good manners. And yet this intonation and manner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost incredibly incongruous with the childishly simple and happy expression of her face, the soft, babyish joy in her eyes. Katerina Ivanovna at once made her sit down in an arm-chair facing Alyosha, and ecstatically kissed her several times on her smiling lips. She seemed quite in love with her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is the first time we've met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> she said rapturously. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to her, but I'd no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg163"></a> knew we should settle everything together&#8212;everything. My heart told me so&#8212;I was begged not to take the step, but I foresaw it would be a way out of the difficulty, and I was not mistaken. Grushenka has explained everything to me, told me all she means to do. She flew here like an angel of goodness and brought us peace and joy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,&#8221;</span> drawled Grushenka in her sing-song voice, still with the same charming smile of delight.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch! Disdain you! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks as though it were swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and more. Look how she laughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does one's heart good to see the angel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running down him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am not at all worthy of your kindness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not worthy! She's not worthy of it!&#8221;</span> Katerina Ivanovna cried again with the same warmth. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we're fanciful, we're self-willed, but proudest of the proud in our little heart. We're noble, we're generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let me tell you. We have only been unfortunate. We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy, perhaps, or fickle man. There was one man&#8212;one, an officer too, we loved him, we sacrificed everything to him. That was long ago, five years ago, and he has forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a widower, he has written, he is coming here, and, do you know, we've loved him, none but him, all this time, and we've loved him all our life! He will come, and Grushenka will be happy again. For the last five years she's been wretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast of her favor? Only that bedridden old merchant, but he is more like her father, her friend, her protector. He found her then in despair, in agony, deserted by the man she loved. She was ready to drown herself then, but the old merchant saved her&#8212;saved her!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a great hurry about everything,&#8221;</span> Grushenka drawled again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg164"></a> defend you? Grushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that charming soft little hand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It has brought me happiness and has lifted me up, and I'm going to kiss it, outside and inside, here, here, here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather fat, hand of Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand with a charming musical, nervous little laugh, watched the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;sweet young lady,&#8221;</span> and obviously liked having her hand kissed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps there's rather too much rapture,&#8221;</span> thought Alyosha. He blushed. He felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You won't make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand like this before Alexey Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you think I meant to make you blush?&#8221;</span> said Katerina Ivanovna, somewhat surprised. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, my dear, how little you understand me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young lady. Maybe I'm not so good as I seem to you. I've a bad heart; I will have my own way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But now you'll save him. You've given me your word. You'll explain it all to him. You'll break to him that you have long loved another man, who is now offering you his hand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no! I didn't give you my word to do that. It was you kept talking about that. I didn't give you my word.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then I didn't quite understand you,&#8221;</span> said Katerina Ivanovna slowly, turning a little pale. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You promised&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no, angel lady, I've promised nothing,&#8221;</span> Grushenka interrupted softly and evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see at once, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I am compared with you. If I want to do a thing I do it. I may have made you some promise just now. But now again I'm thinking: I may take to Mitya again. I liked him very much once&#8212;liked him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell him to stay with me from this day forward. You see, I'm so changeable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Just now you said&#8212;something quite different,&#8221;</span> Katerina Ivanovna whispered faintly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, just now! But, you know. I'm such a soft-hearted, silly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg165"></a> creature. Only think what he's gone through on my account! What if when I go home I feel sorry for him? What then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I never expected&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with me! Now perhaps you won't care for a silly creature like me, now you know my character. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic lady,&#8221;</span> she said tenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovna's hand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here, dear young lady, I'll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine. You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours three hundred times to be even with you. Well, but let that pass. And then it shall be as God wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave. Let it be as God wills, without any agreements and promises. What a sweet hand&#8212;what a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you incredible beauty!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object indeed of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;being even&#8221;</span> with her in kisses.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with timid hope to the last words, though Grushenka's promise to do her bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently into her eyes; she still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted, confiding expression, the same bright gayety.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's perhaps too na&#239;ve,&#8221;</span> thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a gleam of hope.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;sweet hand.&#8221;</span> She raised it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three minutes near her lips, as though reconsidering something.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know, angel lady,&#8221;</span> she suddenly drawled in an even more soft and sugary voice, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;do you know, after all, I think I won't kiss your hand?&#8221;</span> And she laughed a little merry laugh.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As you please. What's the matter with you?&#8221;</span> said Katerina Ivanovna, starting suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss yours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness at Katerina Ivanovna.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Insolent creature!&#8221;</span> cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg166"></a> grasping something. She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grushenka too got up, but without haste.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss yours at all. And how he will laugh!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Vile slut! Go away!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That's unbecoming for you, dear young lady, a word like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Go away! You're a creature for sale!&#8221;</span> screamed Katerina Ivanovna. Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once; you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but Alyosha held her with all his strength.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not a step, not a word! Don't speak, don't answer her. She'll go away&#8212;she'll go at once.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At that instant Katerina Ivanovna's two aunts ran in at her cry, and with them a maid-servant. All hurried to her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will go away,&#8221;</span> said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the sofa. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, darling, see me home!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Go away&#8212;go away, make haste!&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha, clasping his hands imploringly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I've got a pretty little story to tell you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha. See me home, dear, you'll be glad of it afterwards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of the house, laughing musically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and was shaken with convulsions. Every one fussed round her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I warned you,&#8221;</span> said the elder of her aunts. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I tried to prevent your doing this. You're too impulsive. How could you do such a thing? You don't know these creatures, and they say she's worse than any of them. You are too self-willed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's a tigress!&#8221;</span> yelled Katerina Ivanovna. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why did you hold me, Alexey Fyodorovitch? I'd have beaten her&#8212;beaten her!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did not care to, indeed.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg167"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha withdrew towards the door.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But, my God!&#8221;</span> cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He! He! He could be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he told that creature what happened on that fatal, accursed day! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You brought your beauty for sale, dear young lady.&#8217;</span> She knows it! Your brother's a scoundrel, Alexey Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn't find a word. His heart ached.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It's shameful, it's awful for me! To-morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Don't condemn me. Forgive me. I don't know what I shall do with myself now!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept as she did. Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame Hohlakov; it's been left with us since dinner-time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it, almost unconsciously, into his pocket.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c2">
<a id="toc55"></a> <a id="pdf56"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00028"><span class="c9">Chapter XI. Another Reputation Ruined</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the town to the monastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that hour deserted. It was almost night, and too dark to see anything clearly at thirty paces ahead. There were cross-roads half-way. A figure came into sight under a solitary willow at the cross-roads. As soon as Alyosha reached the cross-roads the figure moved out and rushed at him, shouting savagely:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Your money or your life!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So it's you, Mitya,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startled however.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ha ha ha! You didn't expect me? I wondered where to wait for you. By her house? There are three ways from it, and I might have missed you. At last I thought of waiting here, for you had to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg168"></a> pass here, there's no other way to the monastery. Come, tell me the truth. Crush me like a beetle. But what's the matter?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nothing, brother&#8212;it's the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri! Father's blood just now.&#8221;</span> (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on the verge of tears for a long time, and now something seemed to snap in his soul.) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You almost killed him&#8212;cursed him&#8212;and now&#8212;here&#8212;you're making jokes&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Your money or your life!&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, what of that? It's not seemly&#8212;is that it? Not suitable in my position?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No&#8212;I only&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what clouds, what a wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting for you. And as God's above, I suddenly thought, why go on in misery any longer, what is there to wait for? Here I have a willow, a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist them into a rope in a minute, and braces besides, and why go on burdening the earth, dishonoring it with my vile presence? And then I heard you coming&#8212;Heavens, it was as though something flew down to me suddenly. So there is a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear little brother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only one I love in the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that moment that I thought, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll fall on his neck at once.&#8217;</span> Then a stupid idea struck me, to have a joke with you and scare you. I shouted, like a fool, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Your money!&#8217;</span> Forgive my foolery&#8212;it was only nonsense, and there's nothing unseemly in my soul.... Damn it all, tell me what's happened. What did she say? Strike me, crush me, don't spare me! Was she furious?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. There&#8212;I found them both there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Both? Whom?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna's.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Dmitri was struck dumb.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're raving! Grushenka with her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha described all that had happened from the moment he went in to Katerina Ivanovna's. He was ten minutes telling his story. He can't be said to have told it fluently and consecutively, but he seemed to make it clear, not omitting any word or action of significance, and vividly describing, often in one word, his own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg169"></a> sensations. Dmitri listened in silence, gazing at him with a terrible fixed stare, but it was clear to Alyosha that he understood it all, and had grasped every point. But as the story went on, his face became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He scowled, he clenched his teeth, and his fixed stare became still more rigid, more concentrated, more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible rapidity, his wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed lips parted, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneous laughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time he could not speak.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So she wouldn't kiss her hand! So she didn't kiss it; so she ran away!&#8221;</span> he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight it might have been called, if it had not been so spontaneous. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So the other one called her tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought to be flogged on a scaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. That's just what I think; she ought to have been long ago. It's like this, brother, let her be punished, but I must get better first. I understand the queen of impudence. That's her all over! You saw her all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! She's magnificent in her own line! So she ran home? I'll go&#8212;ah&#8212;I'll run to her! Alyosha, don't blame me, I agree that hanging is too good for her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But Katerina Ivanovna!&#8221;</span> exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see her, too! I see right through her, as I've never done before! It's a regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is, of the five! What a thing to do! That's just like Katya, who was not afraid to face a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly insult on a generous impulse to save her father! But the pride, the recklessness, the defiance of fate, the unbounded defiance! You say that aunt tried to stop her? That aunt, you know, is overbearing, herself. She's the sister of the general's widow in Moscow, and even more stuck-up than she. But her husband was caught stealing government money. He lost everything, his estate and all, and the proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasn't raised them since. So she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn't listen to her! She thinks she can overcome everything, that everything will give way to her. She thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and she believed it herself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault is it? Do you think she kissed Grushenka's hand first, on purpose, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg170"></a> with a motive? No, she really was fascinated by Grushenka, that's to say, not by Grushenka, but by her own dream, her own delusion&#8212;because it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">her</span></em> dream, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">her</span></em> delusion! Alyosha, darling, how did you escape from them, those women? Did you pick up your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother, you don't seem to have noticed how you've insulted Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her beauty! Brother, what could be worse than that insult?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as it seemed, his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna's humiliation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Bah!&#8221;</span> Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his hand. He only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told him of the insult, and Katerina Ivanovna's cry: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Your brother is a scoundrel!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;fatal day,&#8217;</span> as Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time at Mokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was sobbing. I was sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya's image, and Grushenka understood it. She understood it all then. I remember, she cried herself.... Damn it all! But it's bound to be so now.... Then she cried, but now <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the dagger in the heart&#8217;</span>! That's how women are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He looked down and sank into thought.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!&#8221;</span> he said suddenly, in a gloomy voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It doesn't matter whether I cried or not, I'm a scoundrel! Tell her I accept the name, if that's any comfort. Come, that's enough. Good-by. It's no use talking! It's not amusing. You go your way and I mine. And I don't want to see you again except as a last resource. Good-by, Alexey!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He warmly pressed Alyosha's hand, and still looking down, without raising his head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly towards the town.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away so abruptly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!&#8221;</span> cried Dmitri, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg171"></a> suddenly turning back. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Look at me. Look at me well. You see here, here&#8212;there's terrible disgrace in store for me.&#8221;</span> (As he said <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;here,&#8221;</span> Dmitri struck his chest with his fist with a strange air, as though the dishonor lay precisely on his chest, in some spot, in a pocket, perhaps, or hanging round his neck.) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know me now, a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but let me tell you that I've never done anything before and never shall again, anything that can compare in baseness with the dishonor which I bear now at this very minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to pass, though I'm perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry it through, note that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through. I shan't stop it. I told you everything just now, but I didn't tell you this, because even I had not brass enough for it. I can still pull up; if I do, I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow. But I shan't pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear witness that I told you so beforehand. Darkness and destruction! No need to explain. You'll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley and the she-devil. Good-by. Don't pray for me, I'm not worth it. And there's no need, no need at all.... I don't need it! Away!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards the monastery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?&#8221;</span> he wondered wildly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I shall look him up. I shall make a point of it. What does he mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr class="c27">
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the hermitage. The door was opened to him, though no one was admitted at that hour. There was a tremor in his heart as he went into Father Zossima's cell.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the world? Here was peace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion, there was darkness in which one lost one's way and went astray at once....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Pa&#239;ssy, who came every hour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt with alarm that he was getting worse and worse. Even his usual discourse with the brothers could not take place that day. As a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg172"></a> rule every evening after service the monks flocked into Father Zossima's cell, and all confessed aloud their sins of the day, their sinful thoughts and temptations; even their disputes, if there had been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elder absolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed them. It was against this general <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;confession&#8221;</span> that the opponents of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;elders&#8221;</span> protested, maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament of confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a different thing. They even represented to the diocesan authorities that such confessions attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led to sin and temptation. Many of the brothers disliked going to the elder, and went against their own will because every one went, and for fear they should be accused of pride and rebellious ideas. People said that some of the monks agreed beforehand, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll confess I lost my temper with you this morning, and you confirm it,&#8221;</span> simply in order to have something to say. Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes. He knew, too, that there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened and read by him before those to whom they were addressed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in good faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance. But, in fact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was false and strained in this practice. Yet the older and more experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, who find it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in entering the monastery&#8212;their proper place is in the world. Even in the temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no good taking it too much into account.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,&#8221;</span> Father Pa&#239;ssy whispered to Alyosha, as he blessed him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's difficult to rouse him. And he must not be roused. He waked up for five minutes, sent his blessing to the brothers, and begged their prayers for him at night. He intends to take the sacrament again in the morning. He remembered you, Alexey. He asked whether you had gone <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg173"></a> away, and was told that you were in the town. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I blessed him for that work,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;his place is there, not here, for awhile.&#8217;</span> Those were his words about you. He remembered you lovingly, with anxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how is it that he has decided that you shall spend some time in the world? He must have foreseen something in your destiny! Understand, Alexey, that if you return to the world, it must be to do the duty laid upon you by your elder, and not for frivolous vanity and worldly pleasures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Pa&#239;ssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father Zossima was dying, though he might live another day or two. Alyosha firmly and ardently resolved that in spite of his promises to his father, the Hohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not leave the monastery next day, but would remain with his elder to the end. His heart glowed with love, and he reproached himself bitterly for having been able for one instant to forget him whom he had left in the monastery on his deathbed, and whom he honored above every one in the world. He went into Father Zossima's bedroom, knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder, who slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing and a peaceful face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had received his guests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay down on the hard, narrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used as a bed, bringing nothing but a pillow. The mattress, about which his father had shouted to him that morning, he had long forgotten to lie on. He took off his cassock, which he used as a covering. But before going to bed, he fell on his knees and prayed a long time. In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to lighten his darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which always visited his soul after the praise and adoration, of which his evening prayer usually consisted. That joy always brought him light untroubled sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket the little pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina Ivanovna's. He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then, after some hesitation, he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to him, signed by Lise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at him before the elder in the morning.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg174"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> she wrote, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am writing to you without any one's knowledge, even mamma's, and I know how wrong it is. But I cannot live without telling you the feeling that has sprung up in my heart, and this no one but us two must know for a time. But how am I to say what I want so much to tell you? Paper, they say, does not blush, but I assure you it's not true and that it's blushing just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha, I love you, I've loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when you were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you all my life. My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass them together till our old age. Of course, on condition that you will leave the monastery. As for our age we will wait for the time fixed by the law. By that time I shall certainly be quite strong, I shall be walking and dancing. There can be no doubt of that.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see how I've thought of everything. There's only one thing I can't imagine: what you'll think of me when you read this. I'm always laughing and being naughty. I made you angry this morning, but I assure you before I took up my pen, I prayed before the Image of the Mother of God, and now I'm praying, and almost crying.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I don't know how I shall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if I can't restrain myself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as I did to-day. You'll think I'm a nasty girl making fun of you, and you won't believe my letter. And so I beg you, dear one, if you've any pity for me, when you come to-morrow, don't look me straight in the face, for if I meet your eyes, it will be sure to make me laugh, especially as you'll be in that long gown. I feel cold all over when I think of it, so when you come, don't look at me at all for a time, look at mamma or at the window....</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here I've written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I done? Alyosha, don't despise me, and if I've done something very horrid and wounded you, forgive me. Now the secret of my reputation, ruined perhaps for ever, is in your hands.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall certainly cry to-day. Good-by till our meeting, our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">awful</span></em> meeting.&#8212;<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c28">Lise.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;P.S.&#8212;Alyosha! You must, must, must come!&#8212;<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c28">Lise.</span></span>&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg175"></a> thought a little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He started. That laugh seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he laughed again just as softly and happily. He slowly replaced the note in the envelope, crossed himself and lay down. The agitation in his heart passed at once. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God, have mercy upon all of them, have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy keeping, and set them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save them according to Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!&#8221;</span> Alyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.</p>
