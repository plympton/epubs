<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00015"><span class="c9">Chapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A Career</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated him on his bed. It was a little room furnished with the bare necessities. There was a narrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a mattress. In the corner, under the ikons, was a reading-desk with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The elder sank exhausted on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard. He looked intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you are needed there, go and wait at the Father Superior's table.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let me stay here,&#8221;</span> Alyosha entreated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will wait, and be of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And remember, my son&#8221;</span>&#8212;the elder liked to call him that&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;this is not the place for you in the future. When it is God's will to call me, leave the monastery. Go away for good.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha started.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you for great service in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage. And you will have to take a wife, too. You will have to bear <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">all</span></em> before you come back. There will be much to do. But I don't doubt of you, and so I send you forth. Christ is with you. Do not abandon Him and He will not abandon you. You will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy. This is my last message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly. Remember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not only my days but my hours are numbered.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha's face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his mouth quivered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it again?&#8221;</span> Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The worldly may follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the father who is departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me, I must pray. Go, and make haste. Be near your brothers. And not near one only, but near both.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg080"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make no protest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed, moreover, to ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question was on the tip of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had thought fit. But evidently it was not his will. That action had made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believed blindly in its mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior's dinner, he felt a sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossima's words, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how could he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearing him? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the monastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go&#8212;about five hundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin. He was waiting for some one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you waiting for me?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha, overtaking him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes,&#8221;</span> grinned Rakitin. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are hurrying to the Father Superior, I know; he has a banquet. There's not been such a banquet since the Superior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you remember? I shan't be there, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell me one thing, Alexey, what does that vision mean? That's what I want to ask you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What vision?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn't he tap the ground with his forehead, too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You speak of Father Zossima?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, of Father Zossima.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tapped the ground?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what does that vision mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg081"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know what it means, Misha.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I knew he wouldn't explain it to you! There's nothing wonderful about it, of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an object in the performance. All the pious people in the town will talk about it and spread the story through the province, wondering what it meant. To my thinking the old man really has a keen nose; he sniffed a crime. Your house stinks of it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What crime?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It'll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and your rich old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready for what may turn up. If something happens later on, it'll be: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Ah, the holy man foresaw it, prophesied it!&#8217;</span> though it's a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Ah, but it was symbolic,&#8217;</span> they'll say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;an allegory,&#8217;</span> and the devil knows what all! It'll be remembered to his glory: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He predicted the crime and marked the criminal!&#8217;</span> That's always the way with these crazy fanatics; they cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Like your elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a murderer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What crime? What murderer? What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What murderer? As though you didn't know! I'll bet you've thought of it before. That's interesting, too, by the way. Listen, Alyosha, you always speak the truth, though you're always between two stools. Have you thought of it or not? Answer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was taken aback.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What? Have you really?&#8221;</span> he cried.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I ... I've not exactly thought it,&#8221;</span> muttered Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but directly you began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought of it myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your father and your brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime. Then I'm not mistaken?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But wait, wait a minute,&#8221;</span> Alyosha broke in uneasily. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What has led you to see all this? Why does it interest you? That's the first question.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg082"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I'll deal with them separately. What led me to see it? I shouldn't have seen it, if I hadn't suddenly understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the very heart of him all at once. I caught the whole man from one trait. These very honest but passionate people have a line which mustn't be crossed. If it were, he'd run at your father with a knife. But your father's a drunken and abandoned old sinner, who can never draw the line&#8212;if they both let themselves go, they'll both come to grief.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, Misha, no. If that's all, you've reassured me. It won't come to that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest, our Mitya (he is stupid, but honest), but he's&#8212;a sensualist. That's the very definition and inner essence of him. It's your father has handed him on his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder at you, Alyosha, how you can have kept your purity. You're a Karamazov too, you know! In your family sensuality is carried to a disease. But now, these three sensualists are watching one another, with their knives in their belts. The three of them are knocking their heads together, and you may be the fourth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri&#8212;despises her,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, with a sort of shudder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn't despise her. Since he has openly abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn't despise her. There's something here, my dear boy, that you don't understand yet. A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's body, or even with a part of a woman's body (a sensualist can understand that), and he'll abandon his own children for her, sell his father and mother, and his country, Russia, too. If he's honest, he'll steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's faithful, he'll deceive. Pushkin, the poet of women's feet, sung of their feet in his verse. Others don't sing their praises, but they can't look at their feet without a thrill&#8212;and it's not only their feet. Contempt's no help here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he can't tear himself away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I understand that,&#8221;</span> Alyosha jerked out suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it out at the first word,&#8221;</span> said Rakitin, malignantly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That escaped <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg083"></a> you unawares, and the confession's the more precious. So it's a familiar subject; you've thought about it already, about sensuality, I mean! Oh, you virgin soul! You're a quiet one, Alyosha, you're a saint, I know, but the devil only knows what you've thought about, and what you know already! You are pure, but you've been down into the depths.... I've been watching you a long time. You're a Karamazov yourself; you're a thorough Karamazov&#8212;no doubt birth and selection have something to answer for. You're a sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why do you tremble? Is it true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has been begging me to bring you along. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll pull off his cassock,&#8217;</span> she says. You can't think how she keeps begging me to bring you. I wondered why she took such an interest in you. Do you know, she's an extraordinary woman, too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thank her and say I'm not coming,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, with a strained smile. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you my idea after.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's nothing to finish. It's all clear. It's the same old tune, brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother, Ivan? He's a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you Karamazovs is that you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown motive of his own, though he's an atheist, and he admits it's a fraud himself&#8212;that's your brother Ivan. He's trying to get Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I fancy he'll succeed, too. And what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For Mitya will surrender his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to Grushenka. And he's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and disinterestedness. Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the devil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing in Mitya's way now. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka. His mouth waters at the sight of her. It's simply on her account he made that scene in the cell just now, simply because Mi&#252;sov called her an <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;abandoned creature.&#8217;</span> He's worse than a tom-cat in love. At first she was only employed by him in connection with his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he has suddenly realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg084"></a> pestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And they'll come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path! But Grushenka favors neither of them, she's still playing with them, and teasing them both, considering which she can get most out of. For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn't marry her, and maybe he'll turn stingy in the end, and keep his purse shut. That's where Mitya's value comes in; he has no money, but he's ready to marry her. Yes, ready to marry her! to abandon his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina Ivanovna, who's rich, and the daughter of a colonel, and to marry Grushenka, who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant, Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated, provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict may well come to pass from all this, and that's what your brother Ivan is waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He'll carry off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her dowry of sixty thousand. That's very alluring to start with, for a man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won't be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I know as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy of his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She's hesitating between the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?&#8221;</span> Alyosha asked sharply, frowning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know I'm speaking the truth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You don't like Ivan. Ivan wouldn't be tempted by money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It's not only the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to any one for thousands. It is not money, it's not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it's suffering he is seeking.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What wild dream now? Oh, you&#8212;aristocrats!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"></a> He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who don't want millions, but an answer to their questions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's plagiarism, Alyosha. You're quoting your elder's phrases. Ah, Ivan has set you a problem!&#8221;</span> cried Rakitin, with undisguised malice. His face changed, and his lips twitched. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And the problem's a stupid one. It is no good guessing it. Rack your brains&#8212;you'll understand it. His article is absurd and ridiculous. And did you hear his stupid theory just now: if there's no immortality of the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything is lawful. (And by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I will remember!&#8217;</span>) An attractive theory for scoundrels!&#8212;(I'm being abusive, that's stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">poseurs</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;haunted by profound, unsolved doubts.&#8217;</span> He's showing off, and what it all comes to is, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;on the one hand we cannot but admit&#8217;</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;on the other it must be confessed!&#8217;</span> His whole theory is a fraud! Humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue even without believing in immortality. It will find it in love for freedom, for equality, for fraternity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as though remembering something, he stopped short.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, that's enough,&#8221;</span> he said, with a still more crooked smile. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm a vulgar fool?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are clever but ... never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your getting hot about it, Misha. I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I've suspected that for a long time, brother, that's why you don't like my brother Ivan. Are you jealous of him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And jealous of her money, too? Won't you add that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother Ivan with you. Don't you understand that one might very well dislike him, apart from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil should I like him? He condescends to abuse me, you know. Why haven't I a right to abuse him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad. He doesn't speak of you at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg086"></a> he was abusing me for all he was worth&#8212;you see what an interest he takes in your humble servant. And which is the jealous one after that, brother, I can't say. He was so good as to express the opinion that, if I don't go in for the career of an archimandrite in the immediate future and don't become a monk, I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer, that I shall write for the next ten years, and in the end become the owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of socialism, but keeping a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in with both sides and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother's account, the tinge of socialism won't hinder me from laying by the proceeds and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the end of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my publishing offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has even chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the Neva, which they say is to be built in Petersburg.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, Misha, that's just what will really happen, every word of it,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, no, I'm joking, forgive me. I've something quite different in my mind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You can't have been at Katerina Ivanovna's yourself when he was talking about you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wasn't there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him tell it with my own ears; if you want to know, he didn't tell me, but I overheard him, unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in Grushenka's bedroom and I couldn't go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch was in the next room.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, yes, I'd forgotten she was a relation of yours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!&#8221;</span> cried Rakitin, turning crimson. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you mad? You're out of your mind!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, isn't she a relation of yours? I heard so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being an ancient, noble family, though your father used to run about playing the buffoon at other men's tables, and was only admitted to the kitchen as a favor. I may be only a priest's son, and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like you, but don't insult me so lightly and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg087"></a> wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I couldn't be a relation of Grushenka, a common harlot. I beg you to understand that!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Rakitin was intensely irritated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Forgive me, for goodness' sake, I had no idea ... besides ... how can you call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?&#8221;</span> Alyosha flushed suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I tell you again, I heard that she was a relation of yours. You often go to see her, and you told me yourself you're not her lover. I never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That's not your business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father, is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. You'd better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is it? Are we late? They can't have finished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have. Here's your father and your brother Ivan after him. They've broken out from the Father Superior's. And look, Father Isidor's shouting out something after them from the steps. And your father's shouting and waving his arms. I expect he's swearing. Bah, and there goes Mi&#252;sov driving away in his carriage. You see, he's going. And there's old Maximov running!&#8212;there must have been a row. There can't have been any dinner. Surely they've not been beating the Father Superior! Or have they, perhaps, been beaten? It would serve them right!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a scandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse of a moment.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00016"><span class="c9">Chapter VIII. The Scandalous Scene</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mi&#252;sov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel some inward qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of having lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg088"></a> Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The monks were not to blame, in any case,&#8221;</span> he reflected, on the steps. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show them that I've nothing to do with that &#198;sop, that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this affair, just as they have.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once. He was the more ready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either. The furniture was of mahogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness, and there were many choice flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beautifully decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas&#8212;both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup made of sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish served in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere, and got information about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg089"></a> to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable, and quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have influenced him in that.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Pa&#239;ssy, and one other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were already waiting when Mi&#252;sov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to receive his blessing. Mi&#252;sov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peasants do.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,&#8221;</span> began Mi&#252;sov, simpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitality, and not without reason. In the reverend Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ... in fact, quite unseemly ... as&#8221;</span>&#8212;he glanced at the monks&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;your reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognizing that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">As he uttered the last word of his tirade, Mi&#252;sov completely recovered his self-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation disappeared. He fully and sincerely loved humanity again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg090"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculiar fervor.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he really had meant to go home, and really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happened, after his disgraceful behavior in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself&#8212;quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&#8221;</span> He longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&#8221;</span> And he had answered them, with his shameless impudence, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Remembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&#8221;</span> he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed in the following words, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will show them I don't care what they think&#8212;that's all!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned to the monastery and straight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would do, but he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obscenity, but only to obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he could be legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marveled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeared in the Father Superior's dining-room, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg091"></a> at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&#8221;</span> he cried to the whole room.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">For one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at once every one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Mi&#252;sov passed immediately from the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No! this I cannot endure!&#8221;</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I absolutely cannot! and ... I certainly cannot!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it he cannot?&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that he absolutely cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you receive me as your guest?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are welcome with all my heart,&#8221;</span> answered the Superior. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen!&#8221;</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside your dissensions, and to be united in love and family harmony&#8212;with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, no, it is impossible!&#8221;</span> cried Mi&#252;sov, beside himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my relation. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you mean me?&#8221;</span> muttered Maximov, puzzled.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course I mean you,&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who else? The Father Superior could not be von Sohn.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famous murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry&#8212;I believe that is what such places are called among you&#8212;he was killed and robbed, and in spite of his venerable age, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg092"></a> was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the luggage van, and while they were nailing him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is happening? What's this?&#8221;</span> voices were heard in the group of monks.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let us go,&#8221;</span> cried Mi&#252;sov, addressing Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, excuse me,&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another step into the room. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Allow me to finish. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Mi&#252;sov, my relation, prefers to have <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">plus de noblesse que de sinc&#233;rit&#233;</span></span> in his words, but I prefer in mine <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">plus de sinc&#233;rit&#233; que de noblesse</span></span>, and&#8212;damn the <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">noblesse</span></span>! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul of honor, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performance. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignant with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before every one that I did this and that ... well, you understand what&#8212;sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it&#8212;so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say ... at the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicious rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg093"></a> monastery, but in others where the institution of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on&#8212;absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on the current of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audience, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectly well that with each word he would be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself, and plunged forward blindly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How disgraceful!&#8221;</span> cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Pardon me!&#8221;</span> said the Father Superior. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was said of old, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correction of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#8217;</span> And so we humbly thank you, honored guest!&#8221;</span> and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tut&#8212;tut&#8212;tut&#8212;sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We know all about them. A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Robbers</span></span>. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it&#8212;you'll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&#8221;</span> He went up to the table. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg094"></a> fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy fathers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is too disgraceful!&#8221;</span> said Father Iosif.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Pa&#239;ssy kept obstinately silent. Mi&#252;sov rushed from the room, and Kalganov after him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humiliation I endured.&#8221;</span> He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalism, the age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred roubles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one moment almost believing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It is written again, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#8217;</span> And so will we.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg095"></a> instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.&#8221;</span> He went out, shouting and gesticulating.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey!&#8221;</span> his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow and mattress, and leave no trace behind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silence without even turning to say good-by to Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running. He was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am going with you!&#8221;</span> he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Take me, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There!&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Did I not say he was von Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">vonsohn</span></span> there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprised at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the box, von Sohn!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chance he did not fall.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Drive on!&#8221;</span> Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you do that?&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, you are a fellow,&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg096"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, it was you got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you approved of it. Why are you angry now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&#8221;</span> Ivan snapped sullenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&#8221;</span> he observed sententiously, but Ivan made no response.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan was still silent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speak again all the way home.</p>
