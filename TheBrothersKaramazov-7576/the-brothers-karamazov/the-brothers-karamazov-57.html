<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00104"><span class="c9">Chapter IX. The Galloping Troika. The End Of The Prosecutor's Speech.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ippolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of exposition, beloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation a check on their own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page810"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg810"></a> speech he went off into a dissertation on Grushenka's <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;first lover,&#8221;</span> and brought forward several interesting thoughts on this theme.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed, so to speak, and effaced himself at once before this first lover. What makes it all the more strange is that he seems to have hardly thought of this formidable rival. But he had looked upon him as a remote danger, and Karamazov always lives in the present. Possibly he regarded him as a fiction. But his wounded heart grasped instantly that the woman had been concealing this new rival and deceiving him, because he was anything but a fiction to her, because he was the one hope of her life. Grasping this instantly, he resigned himself.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected trait in the prisoner's character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible desire for justice, a respect for woman and a recognition of her right to love. And all this at the very moment when he had stained his hands with his father's blood for her sake! It is true that the blood he had shed was already crying out for vengeance, for, after having ruined his soul and his life in this world, he was forced to ask himself at that same instant what he was and what he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to him than his own soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returned penitent, with new love, to the woman he had once betrayed, with honorable offers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life. And he, luckless man, what could he give her now, what could he offer her?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him by his crime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a man with life before him! This thought crushed him. And so he instantly flew to one frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov's character, must have appeared the one inevitable way out of his terrible position. That way out was suicide. He ran for the pistols he had left in pledge with his friend Perhotin and on the way, as he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money, for the sake of which he had stained his hands with his father's gore. Oh, now he needed money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his life. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;To her, to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page811"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg811"></a> her! and there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such as never was before, that will be remembered and talked of long after! In the midst of shouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy songs and dances I shall raise the glass and drink to the woman I adore and her new-found happiness! And then, on the spot, at her feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and punish myself! She will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see how Mitya loved her, she will feel for Mitya!&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes, but there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries out in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart unto death&#8212;that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">something</span></em> is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its judgment, its terrible torments! The pistol will settle everything, the pistol is the only way out! But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">beyond</span></em>&#8212;I don't know whether Karamazov wondered at that moment <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What lies beyond,&#8217;</span> and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet, wonder <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What lies beyond.&#8217;</span> No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their Hamlets, but we still have our Karamazovs!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya's preparations, the scene at Perhotin's, at the shop, with the drivers. He quoted numerous words and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and the picture made a terrible impression on the audience. The guilt of this harassed and desperate man stood out clear and convincing, when the facts were brought together.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost confessed, hinted at it, all but spoke out.&#8221;</span> (Then followed the evidence given by witnesses.) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He even cried out to the peasant who drove him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Do you know, you are driving a murderer!&#8217;</span> But it was impossible for him to speak out, he had to get to Mokroe and there to finish his romance. But what was awaiting the luckless man? Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he saw that his invincible rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the toast to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be acceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from the preliminary inquiry. Karamazov's triumph over his rival was complete and his soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most terrible phase through which his soul has passed or will pass.</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page812"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg812"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,&#8221;</span> the prosecutor continued, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring their own vengeance more completely than any earthly justice. What's more, justice and punishment on earth positively alleviate the punishment of nature and are, indeed, essential to the soul of the criminal at such moments, as its salvation from despair. For I cannot imagine the horror and moral suffering of Karamazov when he learnt that she loved him, that for his sake she had rejected her first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya, to a new life, that she was promising him happiness&#8212;and when? When everything was over for him and nothing was possible!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for the light it throws on the prisoner's position at the moment. This woman, this love of his, had been till the last moment, till the very instant of his arrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by him but unattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why did he relinquish his design and even forget where his pistol was? It was just that passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that restrained him. Throughout their revels he kept close to his adored mistress, who was at the banquet with him and was more charming and fascinating to him than ever&#8212;he did not leave her side, abasing himself in his homage before her.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear of arrest, but even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh, only for a moment! I can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly enslaved by these influences&#8212;first, the influence of drink, of noise and excitement, of the thud of the dance and the scream of the song, and of her, flushed with wine, singing and dancing and laughing to him! Secondly, the hope in the background that the fatal end might still be far off, that not till next morning, at least, they would come and take him. So he had a few hours and that's much, very much! In a few hours one can think of many things. I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when they are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long street to pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people. Then there will be a turning into another street and only at the end of that street the dread place of execution! I fancy that at the beginning of the journey the condemned man, sitting on his shameful <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page813"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg813"></a> cart, must feel that he has infinite life still before him. The houses recede, the cart moves on&#8212;oh, that's nothing, it's still far to the turning into the second street and he still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously curious people with their eyes fixed on him, and he still fancies that he is just such a man as they. But now the turning comes to the next street. Oh, that's nothing, nothing, there's still a whole street before him, and however many houses have been passed, he will still think there are many left. And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;They've not had time yet,&#8217;</span> he must have thought, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I may still find some way out, oh, there's still time to make some plan of defense, and now, now&#8212;she is so fascinating!&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however, to put aside half his money and hide it somewhere&#8212;I cannot otherwise explain the disappearance of quite half of the three thousand he had just taken from his father's pillow. He had been in Mokroe more than once before, he had caroused there for two days together already, he knew the old big house with all its passages and outbuildings. I imagine that part of the money was hidden in that house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice, under some floor, in some corner, under the roof. With what object? I shall be asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; he hadn't yet considered how to meet it, he hadn't the time, his head was throbbing and his heart was with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">her</span></em>, but money&#8212;money was indispensable in any case! With money a man is always a man. Perhaps such foresight at such a moment may strike you as unnatural? But he assures us himself that a month before, at a critical and exciting moment, he had halved his money and sewn it up in a little bag. And though that was not true, as we shall prove directly, it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he had contemplated it. What's more, when he declared at the inquiry that he had put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never existed) he may have invented that little bag on the inspiration of the moment, because he had two hours before divided his money and hidden half of it at Mokroe till morning, in case of emergency, simply not to have it on himself. Two extremes, gentlemen of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page814"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg814"></a> jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate two extremes and both at once.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We have looked in the house, but we haven't found the money. It may still be there or it may have disappeared next day and be in the prisoner's hands now. In any case he was at her side, on his knees before her, she was lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched out to her and he had so entirely forgotten everything that he did not even hear the men coming to arrest him. He hadn't time to prepare any line of defense in his mind. He was caught unawares and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of his destiny.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of our duties when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his account, too! The moments of contemplating that animal fear, when the criminal sees that all is lost, but still struggles, still means to struggle, the moments when every instinct of self-preservation rises up in him at once and he looks at you with questioning and suffering eyes, studies you, your face, your thoughts, uncertain on which side you will strike, and his distracted mind frames thousands of plans in an instant, but he is still afraid to speak, afraid of giving himself away! This purgatory of the spirit, this animal thirst for self-preservation, these humiliating moments of the human soul, are awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal even in the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some very compromising phrases. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Blood! I've deserved it!&#8217;</span> But he quickly restrained himself. He had not prepared what he was to say, what answer he was to make, he had nothing but a bare denial ready. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am not guilty of my father's death.&#8217;</span> That was his fence for the moment and behind it he hoped to throw up a barricade of some sort. His first compromising exclamations he hastened to explain by declaring that he was responsible for the death of the servant Grigory only. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has killed my father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have killed him, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">if not I</span></em>?&#8217;</span> Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had come to ask him that question! Do you hear that phrase uttered with such premature haste&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;if not I&#8217;</span>&#8212;the animal cunning, the na&#239;vet&#233;, the Karamazov impatience of it? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I didn't kill him and you mustn't think I did! I wanted to kill him, gentlemen, I wanted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page815"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg815"></a> to kill him,&#8217;</span> he hastens to admit (he was in a hurry, in a terrible hurry), <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;but still I am not guilty, it is not I murdered him.&#8217;</span> He concedes to us that he wanted to murder him, as though to say, you can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so you'll believe all the sooner that I didn't murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is often amazingly shallow and credulous.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally, the most simple question, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Wasn't it Smerdyakov killed him?&#8217;</span> Then, as we expected, he was horribly angry at our having anticipated him and caught him unawares, before he had time to pave the way to choose and snatch the moment when it would be most natural to bring in Smerdyakov's name. He rushed at once to the other extreme, as he always does, and began to assure us that Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable of it. But don't believe him, that was only his cunning; he didn't really give up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring him forward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward, but he would do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled for him. He would bring him forward perhaps next day, or even a few days later, choosing an opportunity to cry out to us, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You know I was more skeptical about Smerdyakov than you, you remember that yourselves, but now I am convinced. He killed him, he must have done!&#8217;</span> And for the present he falls back upon a gloomy and irritable denial. Impatience and anger prompted him, however, to the most inept and incredible explanation of how he looked into his father's window and how he respectfully withdrew. The worst of it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the evidence given by Grigory.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged him, the whole three thousand had not been found on him, only half of it. And no doubt only at that moment of angry silence, the fiction of the little bag first occurred to him. No doubt he was conscious himself of the improbability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound more likely, to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible. In such cases the first duty, the chief task of the investigating lawyers, is to prevent the criminal being prepared, to pounce upon him unexpectedly so that he may blurt out his cherished ideas in all their simplicity, improbability and inconsistency. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page816"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg816"></a> The criminal can only be made to speak by the sudden and apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of some circumstance of great importance in the case, of which he had no previous idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact in readiness&#8212;that was Grigory's evidence about the open door through which the prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about that door and had not even suspected that Grigory could have seen it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Then Smerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!&#8217;</span> and so betrayed the basis of the defense he was keeping back, and betrayed it in its most improbable shape, for Smerdyakov could only have committed the murder after he had knocked Grigory down and run away. When we told him that Grigory saw the door was open before he fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind the screen as he came out of his bedroom&#8212;Karamazov was positively crushed. My esteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards that he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And to improve matters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of little bag&#8212;so be it, you shall hear this romance!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider this romance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention that could have been brought forward in the circumstances. If one tried for a bet to invent the most unlikely story, one could hardly find anything more incredible. The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers neglect as insignificant trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for such details, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole, and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But that's how they are caught. The prisoner was asked the question, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Where did you get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I made it myself.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;And where did you get the linen?&#8217;</span> The prisoner was positively offended, he thought it almost insulting to ask him such a trivial question, and would you believe it, his resentment was genuine! But they are all like that. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I tore it off my shirt.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Then we shall find that shirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page817"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg817"></a> torn off.&#8217;</span> And only fancy, gentlemen of the jury, if we really had found that torn shirt (and how could we have failed to find it in his chest of drawers or trunk?) that would have been a fact, a material fact in support of his statement! But he was incapable of that reflection. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I don't remember, it may not have been off my shirt, I sewed it up in one of my landlady's caps.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What sort of a cap?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;And do you remember that clearly?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;No, I don't.&#8217;</span> And he was angry, very angry, and yet imagine not remembering it! At the most terrible moments of man's life, for instance when he is being led to execution, he remembers just such trifles. He will forget anything but some green roof that has flashed past him on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross&#8212;that he will remember. He concealed the making of that little bag from his household, he must have remembered his humiliating fear that some one might come in and find him needle in hand, how at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen (there is a screen in his lodgings).</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these details, trifles?&#8221;</span> cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Just because the prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He has not explained anything since that fatal night two months ago, he has not added one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic statements; all those are trivialities. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You must believe it on my honor.&#8217;</span> Oh, we are glad to believe it, we are eager to believe it, even if only on his word of honor! Are we jackals thirsting for human blood? Show us a single fact in the prisoner's favor and we shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, real fact, and not a conclusion drawn from the prisoner's expression by his own brother, or that when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to point to the little bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new fact, we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to repudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot repudiate anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as though he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance, the blood of the father murdered by his son, with the base motive of robbery! He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page818"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg818"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for the defense,&#8221;</span> Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities, remember that at this moment you are in a temple of justice. Remember that you are the champions of our justice, the champions of our holy Russia, of her principles, her family, everything that she holds sacred! Yes, you represent Russia here at this moment, and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but will re&#235;cho throughout the whole of Russia, and all Russia will hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be encouraged or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia and her expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course. And if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not from respect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from horror. From horror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that they stand aside, but maybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness, for the sake of their own safety, enlightenment and civilization. Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe, they already begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do not heap up their growing hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his son!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up his speech with this rhetorical appeal&#8212;and the effect produced by him was extraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went out hurriedly and, as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the adjoining room. There was no applause in the court, but serious persons were pleased. The ladies were not so well satisfied, though even they were pleased with his eloquence, especially as they had no apprehensions as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust in Fetyukovitch. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He will speak at last and of course carry all before him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Every one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the prosecutor's speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and his head bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and listened, especially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page819"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg819"></a> prosecutor mentioned Rakitin's opinion of her, a smile of contempt and anger passed over his face and he murmured rather audibly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The Bernards!&#8221;</span> When Ippolit Kirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at Mokroe, Mitya raised his head and listened with intense curiosity. At one point he seemed about to jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end of the speech, of the prosecutor's feat in examining the prisoner at Mokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The man could not resist boasting of his cleverness,&#8221;</span> they said.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation and exclamations in the audience. I remember some of them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A weighty speech,&#8221;</span> a gentleman in one group observed gravely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He brought in too much psychology,&#8221;</span> said another voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But it was all true, the absolute truth!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he is first rate at it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He summed it all up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he summed us up, too,&#8221;</span> chimed in another voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you remember, at the beginning of his speech, making out we were all like Fyodor Pavlovitch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And at the end, too. But that was all rot.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And obscure too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was a little too much carried away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's unjust, it's unjust.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, it was smartly done, anyway. He's had long to wait, but he's had his say, ha ha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What will the counsel for the defense say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In another group I heard:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;appealing to your sensibilities&#8217;</span>&#8212;do you remember?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, that was awkward of him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was in too great a hurry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is a nervous man.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, what must it be for Mitya?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In a third group:</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page820"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg820"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the end?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She is a general's wife, divorced, I know her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's why she has the lorgnette.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She is not good for much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is prettier.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn't they, eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, it was smart enough. We've heard it before, how often he has told the story at people's houses!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And he couldn't resist doing it now. That's vanity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is a man with a grievance, he he!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much rhetoric, such long sentences.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you remember about the troika? Something about <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;They have Hamlets, but we have, so far, only Karamazovs!&#8217;</span> That was cleverly said!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, what will Fetyukovitch say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Whatever he says, he won't get round our peasants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't you think so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A fourth group:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What he said about the troika was good, that piece about the other nations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And that was true what he said about other nations not standing it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and speaking about the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not high time to intervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was thinking of him, I know he was. He was talking about that last week.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not an easy job.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not an easy job? Why not?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, we'd shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn. Where would they get it?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page821"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg821"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In America. They get it from America now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch mounted the tribune.</p>

<a id="toc209"></a> <a id="pdf210"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00105"><span class="c9">Chapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out. The eyes of the audience were fastened upon him. He began very simply and directly, with an air of conviction, but not the slightest trace of conceit. He made no attempt at eloquence, at pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a man speaking in a circle of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice was a fine one, sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine and simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at once that the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;pierce the heart with untold power.&#8221;</span> His language was perhaps more irregular than Ippolit Kirillovitch's, but he spoke without long phrases, and indeed, with more precision. One thing did not please the ladies: he kept bending forward, especially at the beginning of his speech, not exactly bowing, but as though he were about to dart at his listeners, bending his long spine in half, as though there were a spring in the middle that enabled him to bend almost at right angles.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly, without system, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though, at the end, these facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided into two parts, the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge, sometimes malicious and sarcastic. But in the second half he suddenly changed his tone, and even his manner, and at once rose to pathos. The audience seemed on the look-out for it, and quivered with enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He went straight to the point, and began by saying that although he practiced in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial towns to defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page822"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg822"></a> at least a preconceived idea. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That is what has happened to me in the present case,&#8221;</span> he explained. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From the very first accounts in the newspapers I was struck by something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner's favor. What interested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice, but rarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the present case. I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech, but I will do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go to work directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my material. That may be imprudent on my part, but at least it's sincere. What I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of evidence against the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that will stand criticism, if it is examined separately. As I followed the case more closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed, and I suddenly received from the prisoner's relatives a request to undertake his defense. I at once hurried here, and here I became completely convinced. It was to break down this terrible chain of facts, and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook the case.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So Fetyukovitch began.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen of the jury,&#8221;</span> he suddenly protested, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am new to this district. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of turbulent and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has insulted perhaps hundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced many people against him beforehand. Of course I recognize that the moral sentiment of local society is justly excited against him. The prisoner is of turbulent and violent temper. Yet he was received in society here; he was even welcome in the family of my talented friend, the prosecutor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">(N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience, quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that the prosecutor received Mitya against his will, solely because he had somehow interested his wife&#8212;a lady of the highest virtue and moral worth, but fanciful, capricious, and fond of opposing her husband, especially in trifles. Mitya's visits, however, had not been frequent.)</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nevertheless I venture to suggest,&#8221;</span> Fetyukovitch continued, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that in spite of his independent mind and just character, my opponent may have formed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page823"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg823"></a> client. Oh, that is so natural; the unfortunate man has only too well deserved such prejudice. Outraged morality, and still more outraged taste, is often relentless. We have, in the talented prosecutor's speech, heard a stern analysis of the prisoner's character and conduct, and his severe critical attitude to the case was evident. And, what's more, he went into psychological subtleties into which he could not have entered, if he had the least conscious and malicious prejudice against the prisoner. But there are things which are even worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious and consciously unfair attitude. It is worse if we are carried away by the artistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a romance, especially if God has endowed us with psychological insight. Before I started on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg, and was myself aware, that I should find here a talented opponent whose psychological insight and subtlety had gained him peculiar renown in legal circles of recent years. But profound as psychology is, it's a knife that cuts both ways.&#8221;</span> (Laughter among the public.) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You will, of course, forgive me my comparison; I can't boast of eloquence. But I will take as an example any point in the prosecutor's speech.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed over the fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down with a brass pestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes over the man, trying to discover whether he had killed him or not. And the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner's statement that he ran to old Grigory out of pity. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;No,&#8217;</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;such sensibility is impossible at such a moment, that's unnatural; he ran to find out whether the only witness of his crime was dead or alive, and so showed that he had committed the murder, since he would not have run back for any other reason.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method and apply it to the case the other way round, and our result will be no less probable. The murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out, as a precaution, whether the witness was alive or not, yet he had left in his murdered father's study, as the prosecutor himself argues, an amazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn envelope, with an inscription that there had been three thousand roubles in it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;If he had carried that envelope away with him, no one in the world would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page824"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg824"></a> have known of that envelope and of the notes in it, and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner.&#8217;</span> Those are the prosecutor's own words. So on one side you see a complete absence of precaution, a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright, leaving that clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he has killed another man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating foresight in him. But even admitting this was so, it is psychological subtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances I become as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle, while at the next I am as timid and blind as a mole. But if I am so bloodthirsty and cruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only run back to find out whether he is alive to witness against me, why should I spend five minutes looking after my victim at the risk of encountering other witnesses? Why soak my handkerchief, wiping the blood off his head so that it may be evidence against me later? If he were so cold-hearted and calculating, why not hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as to kill him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he left another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had taken from the two women, and which they could always recognize afterwards as theirs, and prove that he had taken it from them. And it is not as though he had forgotten it on the path, dropped it through carelessness or haste, no, he had flung away his weapon, for it was found fifteen paces from where Grigory lay. Why did he do so? Just because he was grieved at having killed a man, an old servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse, as a murderous weapon. That's how it must have been, what other reason could he have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent of his father's murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have run to another victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently; his thoughts would have been centered on self-preservation. He would have had none to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt. On the contrary, he would have broken his skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him. There was room for pity and good-feeling just because his conscience had been clear till then. Here we have a different psychology. I have purposely resorted to this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page825"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg825"></a> method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you can prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use of it. Psychology lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite unconsciously. I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Sounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor, were again audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in detail; I will only quote some passages from it, some leading points.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c2">
<a id="toc211"></a> <a id="pdf212"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00106"><span class="c9">Chapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch's speech. He flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand roubles, and consequently, the possibility of their having been stolen.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen of the jury,&#8221;</span> he began. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Every new and unprejudiced observer must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the present case, namely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility of proving that there was anything to be stolen. We are told that money was stolen&#8212;three thousand roubles&#8212;but whether those roubles ever existed, nobody knows. Consider, how have we heard of that sum, and who has seen the notes? The only person who saw them, and stated that they had been put in the envelope, was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to the prisoner and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe. Madame Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these three persons had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen them.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here the question arises, if it's true that they did exist, and that Smerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time? What if his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put them back in his cash-box without telling him? Note, that according to Smerdyakov's story the notes were kept under the mattress; the prisoner must have pulled them out, and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled; that is carefully recorded in the protocol. How could the prisoner have found the notes without disturbing the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page826"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg826"></a> bed? How could he have helped soiling with his blood-stained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been purposely made?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes, it's worth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat surprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of himself&#8212;of himself, observe&#8212;that but for that envelope, but for its being left on the floor, no one in the world would have known of the existence of that envelope and the notes in it, and therefore of the prisoner's having stolen it. And so that torn scrap of paper is, by the prosecutor's own admission, the sole proof on which the charge of robbery rests, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;otherwise no one would have known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.&#8217;</span> But is the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a proof that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen? Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the envelope. But when, when had he seen it for the last time, I ask you that? I talked to Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had seen the notes two days before the catastrophe. Then why not imagine that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked up alone in impatient and hysterical expectation of the object of his adoration, may have whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and taking out the notes. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What's the use of the envelope?&#8217;</span> he may have asked himself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;She won't believe the notes are there, but when I show her the thirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more impression, you may be sure, it will make her mouth water.&#8217;</span> And so he tears open the envelope, takes out the money, and flings the envelope on the floor, conscious of being the owner and untroubled by any fears of leaving evidence.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this theory and such an action? Why is it out of the question? But if anything of the sort could have taken place, the charge of robbery falls to the ground; if there was no money, there was no theft of it. If the envelope on the floor may be taken as evidence that there had been money in it, why may I not maintain the opposite, that the envelope was on the floor because the money had been taken from it by its owner?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page827"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg827"></a> took it out of the envelope since it was not found when the police searched the house? In the first place, part of the money was found in the cash-box, and secondly, he might have taken it out that morning or the evening before to make some other use of it, to give or send it away; he may have changed his idea, his plan of action completely, without thinking it necessary to announce the fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there is the barest possibility of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so positively accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, and of having actually carried out that robbery? This is encroaching on the domain of romance. If it is maintained that something has been stolen, the thing must be produced, or at least its existence must be proved beyond doubt. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly more than a boy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger, went in broad daylight into a moneychanger's shop with an ax, and with extraordinary, typical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteen hundred roubles. Five hours later he was arrested, and, except fifteen roubles he had already managed to spend, the whole sum was found on him. Moreover, the shopman, on his return to the shop after the murder, informed the police not only of the exact sum stolen, but even of the notes and gold coins of which that sum was made up, and those very notes and coins were found on the criminal. This was followed by a full and genuine confession on the part of the murderer. That's what I call evidence, gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch the money, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present case? And yet it is a question of life and death.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering money; he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles&#8212;where did he get the money? But the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be found, and the other half of the sum could nowhere be discovered, shows that that money was not the same, and had never been in any envelope. By strict calculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the prisoner ran straight from those women servants to Perhotin's without going home, and that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time in company and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page828"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg828"></a> hidden half in the town. It's just this consideration that has led the prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at Mokroe. Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen? Isn't this supposition really too fantastic and too romantic? And observe, if that supposition breaks down, the whole charge of robbery is scattered to the winds, for in that case what could have become of the other fifteen hundred roubles? By what miracle could they have disappeared, since it's proved the prisoner went nowhere else? And we are ready to ruin a man's life with such tales!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteen hundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without money before that night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner has made a clear and unflinching statement of the source of that money, and if you will have it so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more probable than that statement, and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the prisoner. The prosecutor is charmed with his own romance. A man of weak will, who had brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by his betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it up, but would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it every two days and taken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a month. All this, you will remember, was put forward in a tone that brooked no contradiction. But what if the thing happened quite differently? What if you've been weaving a romance, and about quite a different kind of man? That's just it, you have invented quite a different man!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on one day all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month before the catastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half. But who are these witnesses? The value of their evidence has been shown in court already. Besides, in another man's hand a crust always seems larger, and no one of these witnesses counted that money; they all judged simply at sight. And the witness Maximov has testified that the prisoner had twenty thousand in his hand. You see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a two-edged weapon. Let me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by Katerina Ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page829"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg829"></a> But the question is: is it true that they were entrusted to him in such an insulting and degrading way as was proclaimed just now? The first statement made by the young lady on the subject was different, perfectly different. In the second statement we heard only cries of resentment and revenge, cries of long-concealed hatred. And the very fact that the witness gave her first evidence incorrectly, gives us a right to conclude that her second piece of evidence may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dare not (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not touch on it either, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and high-principled person, such as that highly respected young lady unquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly in court to contradict her first statement, with the obvious motive of ruining the prisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given not impartially, not coolly. Have not we the right to assume that a revengeful woman might have exaggerated much? Yes, she may well have exaggerated, in particular, the insult and humiliation of her offering him the money. No, it was offered in such a way that it was possible to take it, especially for a man so easy-going as the prisoner, above all, as he expected to receive shortly from his father the three thousand roubles that he reckoned was owing to him. It was unreflecting of him, but it was just his irresponsible want of reflection that made him so confident that his father would give him the money, that he would get it, and so could always dispatch the money entrusted to him and repay the debt.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day have set aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That's not his character, he tells us, he couldn't have had such feelings. But yet he talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once. Karamazov is just such a two-sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that even when moved by the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if something strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is love&#8212;that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress. If she were to say to him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am yours, I won't have Fyodor Pavlovitch,&#8217;</span> then he must have money to take her away. That was more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page830"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg830"></a> important than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to understand it? That anxiety was just what he was suffering from&#8212;what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and concealing it in case of emergency?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner, loved. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;If Fyodor Pavlovitch doesn't give the money,&#8217;</span> he thought, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.&#8217;</span> And then the idea presented itself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am a scoundrel, but not a thief.&#8217;</span> So here we have already a twofold reason why he should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he shouldn't unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time. Why should you deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he has a sense of honor, granted that it's misplaced, granted it's often mistaken, yet it exists and amounts to a passion, and he has proved that.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments reach a climax, and those same two questions torture his fevered brain more and more: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where can I find the means to go off with Grushenka?&#8217;</span> If he behaved wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the taverns in the course of that month, it was perhaps because he was wretched and strained beyond his powers of endurance. These two questions became so acute that they drove him at last to despair. He sent his younger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles, but without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating the old man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no prospect of getting it from any one; his father would not give it him after that beating.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the upper part of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his brother that he had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still he would remain a scoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use that means, that he wouldn't have the character, that he wouldn't have the will-power to do it. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the evidence of Alexey Karamazov, given so genuinely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page831"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg831"></a> and sincerely, so spontaneously and convincingly? And why, on the contrary, does he force me to believe in money hidden in a crevice, in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner wrote that fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous proof of the prisoner having committed robbery! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I shall beg from every one, and if I don't get it I shall murder my father and shall take the envelope with the pink ribbon on it from under his mattress as soon as Ivan has gone.&#8217;</span> A full program of the murder, we are told, so it must have been he. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It has all been done as he wrote,&#8217;</span> cries the prosecutor.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But in the first place, it's the letter of a drunken man and written in great irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from what he has heard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the envelope himself; and thirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you prove that he did it? Did the prisoner take the envelope from under the pillow, did he find the money, did that money exist indeed? And was it to get money that the prisoner ran off, if you remember? He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out where she was, the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carry out a program, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for an act of premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a jealous fury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and murdered him he seized the money, too. But did he murder him after all? The charge of robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man cannot be accused of robbery, if it's impossible to state accurately what he has stolen; that's an axiom. But did he murder him without robbery, did he murder him at all? Is that proved? Isn't that, too, a romance?&#8221;</span></p>
