<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00101"><span class="c9">Chapter VI. The Prosecutor's Speech. Sketches Of Character</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns. He described this himself afterwards. He regarded this speech as his <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">chef-d'&#339;uvre</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">chef-d'&#339;uvre</span></span> of his whole life, as his swan-song. He died, it is true, nine months later of rapid consumption, so that he had the right, as it turned out, to compare himself to a swan singing his last song. He had put his whole heart and all the brain he had into that speech. And poor Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least some feeling for the public welfare and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the eternal question&#8221;</span> lay concealed in him. Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity. He genuinely believed in the prisoner's guilt; he was accusing him not as an official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he quivered with a genuine passion <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for the security of society.&#8221;</span> Even the ladies in the audience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch, admitted that he made an extraordinary impression on them. He began in a breaking voice, but it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of his speech. But as soon as he had finished, he almost fainted.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page786"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg786"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen of the jury,&#8221;</span> began the prosecutor, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;this case has made a stir throughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at, what is there so peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed to such crimes! That's what's so horrible, that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us. What ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it, and not this or that isolated crime. What are the causes of our indifference, our lukewarm attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an unenviable future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion of intellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, in spite of its youth? Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their foundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles among us? I cannot answer such questions; nevertheless they are disturbing, and every citizen not only must, but ought to be harassed by them. Our newborn and still timid press has done good service to the public already, for without it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence and moral degradation which are continually made known by the press, not merely to those who attend the new jury courts established in the present reign, but to every one. And what do we read almost daily? Of things beside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost commonplace. But what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes of violence bear witness to a widespread evil, now so general among us that it is difficult to contend against it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the very outset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a pang of conscience, murdering an official who had once been his benefactor, and the servant girl, to steal his own I.O.U. and what ready money he could find on him; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable world and for my career in the future.&#8217;</span> After murdering them, he puts pillows under the head of each of his victims; he goes away. Next, a young hero <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;decorated for bravery&#8217;</span> kills the mother of his chief and benefactor, like a highwayman, and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;she loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions and take no precautions.&#8217;</span> Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare not say in these days that he is unique. Another man will not commit the murder, but will feel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page787"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg787"></a> soul. In silence, alone with his conscience, he asks himself perhaps, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What is honor, and isn't the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical, that it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let them say so&#8212;and heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were so! Oh, don't believe me, think of me as morbid, but remember my words; if only a tenth, if only a twentieth part of what I say is true&#8212;even so it's awful! Look how our young people commit suicide, without asking themselves Hamlet's question what there is beyond, without a sign of such a question, as though all that relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long been erased in their minds and buried under the sands. Look at our vice, at our profligates. Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless victim in the present case, was almost an innocent babe compared with many of them. And yet we all knew him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;he lived among us!&#8217;</span>...</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of Europe will study the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject is worth it. But this study will come later, at leisure, when all the tragic topsy-turvydom of to-day is farther behind us, so that it's possible to examine it with more insight and more impartiality than I can do. Now we are either horrified or pretend to be horrified, though we really gloat over the spectacle, and love strong and eccentric sensations which tickle our cynical, pampered idleness. Or, like little children, we brush the dreadful ghosts away and hide our heads in the pillow so as to return to our sports and merriment as soon as they have vanished. But we must one day begin life in sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a society; it's time we tried to grasp something of our social position, or at least to make a beginning in that direction.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A great writer<a href="the-brothers-karamazov-60.html#note_9" id="noteref_9" class="dlinternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c24">9</span></span></a> of the last epoch, comparing Russia to a swift troika galloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Oh, troika, birdlike troika, who invented thee!&#8217;</span> and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the peoples of the world stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly galloping troika to pass. That may be, they may stand aside, respectfully or no, but in my poor opinion the great writer ended his book in this way either in an access of childish and na&#239;ve <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page788"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg788"></a> optimism, or simply in fear of the censorship of the day. For if the troika were drawn by his heroes, Sobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov, it could reach no rational goal, whoever might be driving it. And those were the heroes of an older generation, ours are worse specimens still....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch's speech was interrupted by applause. The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. The applause was, it's true, of brief duration, so that the President did not think it necessary to caution the public, and only looked severely in the direction of the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged; he had never been applauded before! He had been all his life unable to get a hearing, and now he suddenly had an opportunity of securing the ear of all Russia.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such an unenviable notoriety throughout Russia?&#8221;</span> he continued. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps I am exaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental features of the educated class of to-day are reflected in this family picture&#8212;only, of course, in miniature, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;like the sun in a drop of water.&#8217;</span> Think of that unhappy, vicious, unbridled old man, who has met with such a melancholy end, the head of a family! Beginning life of noble birth, but in a poor dependent position, through an unexpected marriage he came into a small fortune. A petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, though undeveloped, intelligence, he was, above all, a moneylender, who grew bolder with growing prosperity. His abject and servile characteristics disappeared, his malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that remained. On the spiritual side he was undeveloped, while his vitality was excessive. He saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure, and he brought his children up to be the same. He had no feelings for his duties as a father. He ridiculed those duties. He left his little children to the servants, and was glad to be rid of them, forgot about them completely. The old man's maxim was <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">Apr&#232;s moi le d&#233;luge</span></span>. He was an example of everything that is opposed to civic duty, of the most complete and malignant individualism. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;The world may burn for aught I care, so long as I am all right,&#8217;</span> and he was all right; he was content, he was eager to go on living in the same way for another twenty or thirty years. He swindled his own son and spent his money, his maternal inheritance, on trying to get <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page789"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg789"></a> his mistress from him. No, I don't intend to leave the prisoner's defense altogether to my talented colleague from Petersburg. I will speak the truth myself, I can well understand what resentment he had heaped up in his son's heart against him.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he has paid the penalty. Let us remember, however, that he was a father, and one of the typical fathers of to-day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that he is typical of many modern fathers? Alas! many of them only differ in not openly professing such cynicism, for they are better educated, more cultured, but their philosophy is essentially the same as his. Perhaps I am a pessimist, but you have agreed to forgive me. Let us agree beforehand, you need not believe me, but let me speak. Let me say what I have to say, and remember something of my words.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now for the children of this father, this head of a family. One of them is the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal with him. Of the other two I will speak only cursorily.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education and vigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He has denied and rejected much already, like his father. We have all heard him, he was a welcome guest in local society. He never concealed his opinions, quite the contrary in fact, which justifies me in speaking rather openly of him now, of course, not as an individual, but as a member of the Karamazov family. Another personage closely connected with the case died here by his own hand last night. I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and possibly the illegitimate son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the preliminary inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young Ivan Karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Everything in the world is lawful according to him, and nothing must be forbidden in the future&#8212;that is what he always taught me.&#8217;</span> I believe that idiot was driven out of his mind by this theory, though, of course, the epileptic attacks from which he suffered, and this terrible catastrophe, have helped to unhinge his faculties. But he dropped one very interesting observation, which would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is, indeed, why I've mentioned it: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;If there is one of the sons that is like Fyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page790"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg790"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;With that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling it indelicate to continue further. Oh, I don't want to draw any further conclusions and croak like a raven over the young man's future. We've seen to-day in this court that there are still good impulses in his young heart, that family feeling has not been destroyed in him by lack of faith and cynicism, which have come to him rather by inheritance than by the exercise of independent thought.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth, who does not share his elder brother's gloomy and destructive theory of life. He has sought to cling to the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;ideas of the people,&#8217;</span> or to what goes by that name in some circles of our intellectual classes. He clung to the monastery, and was within an ace of becoming a monk. He seems to me to have betrayed unconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which leads so many in our unhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences, and mistakenly attribute all the mischief to European enlightenment, to return to their <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;native soil,&#8217;</span> as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth, like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the withered bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only to escape the horrors that terrify them.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every success; I trust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of the people may never degenerate, as often happens, on the moral side into gloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind chauvinism&#8212;two elements which are even a greater menace to Russia than the premature decay, due to misunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which his elder brother is suffering.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism and mysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by his own eloquence. All this had little to do with the case in hand, to say nothing of the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and consumptive man was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his life. People said afterwards that he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticism of Ivan, because the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of him in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page791"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg791"></a> take his revenge. But I don't know whether it was true. All this was only introductory, however, and the speech passed to more direct consideration of the case.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But to return to the eldest son,&#8221;</span> Ippolit Kirillovitch went on. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is the prisoner before us. We have his life and his actions, too, before us; the fatal day has come and all has been brought to the surface. While his brothers seem to stand for <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Europeanism&#8217;</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the principles of the people,&#8217;</span> he seems to represent Russia as she is. Oh, not all Russia, not all! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here we have her, our mother Russia, the very scent and sound of her. Oh, he is spontaneous, he is a marvelous mingling of good and evil, he is a lover of culture and Schiller, yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of his boon companions. Oh, he, too, can be good and noble, but only when all goes well with him. What is more, he can be carried off his feet, positively carried off his feet by noble ideals, but only if they come of themselves, if they fall from heaven for him, if they need not be paid for. He dislikes paying for anything, but is very fond of receiving, and that's so with him in everything. Oh, give him every possible good in life (he couldn't be content with less), and put no obstacle in his way, and he will show that he, too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no, but he must have money, a great deal of money, and you will see how generously, with what scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all away in the reckless dissipation of one night. But if he has not money, he will show what he is ready to do to get it when he is in great need of it. But all this later, let us take events in their chronological order.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about the back-yard <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;without boots on his feet,&#8217;</span> as our worthy and esteemed fellow citizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now. I repeat it again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am here to accuse him, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human; I, too, can weigh the influence of home and childhood on the character. But the boy grows up and becomes an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to one of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as an officer. And, of course, he needed money, money before all things, and so after prolonged disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and the last <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page792"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg792"></a> six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which he practically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with his father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and brilliant education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you have only just heard them. Honor, self-sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent. The figure of the young officer, frivolous and profligate, doing homage to true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown in a very sympathetic light before us. But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to us immediately after in this very court. Again I will not venture to conjecture why it happened so, but there were causes. The same lady, bathed in tears of long-concealed indignation, alleged that he, he of all men, had despised her for her action, which, though incautious, reckless perhaps, was still dictated by lofty and generous motives. He, he, the girl's betrothed, looked at her with that smile of mockery, which was more insufferable from him than from any one. And knowing that he had already deceived her (he had deceived her, believing that she was bound to endure everything from him, even treachery), she intentionally offered him three thousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly, let him understand that she was offering him money to deceive her. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Well, will you take it or not, are you so lost to shame?&#8217;</span> was the dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes. He looked at her, saw clearly what was in her mind (he's admitted here before you that he understood it all), appropriated that three thousand unconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new object of his affections.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are we to believe then? The first legend of the young officer sacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity and doing reverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture? As a rule, between two extremes one has to find the mean, but in the present case this is not true. The probability is that in the first case he was genuinely noble, and in the second as genuinely base. And why? Because he was of the broad Karamazov character&#8212;that's just what I am leading up to&#8212;capable of combining the most incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest heights and of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant remark made by a young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page793"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg793"></a> quarters&#8212;Mr. Rakitin: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;The sense of their own degradation is as essential to those reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their lofty generosity.&#8217;</span> And that's true, they need continually this unnatural mixture. Two extremes at the same moment, or they are miserable and dissatisfied and their existence is incomplete. They are wide, wide as mother Russia; they include everything and put up with everything.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we've just touched upon that three thousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things a little. Can you conceive that a man like that, on receiving that sum and in such a way, at the price of such shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation, could have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum, that very day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had the firmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole month afterwards, in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of it! Neither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he was flying into the country, trying to get from God knows whom, the money so essential to him to remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his father, did he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only to avoid abandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so jealous, he would have been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayed at home to keep watch over her, and to await the moment when she would say to him at last <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am yours,&#8217;</span> and to fly with her far from their fatal surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason he gives for it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when she would say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am yours, take me where you will,&#8217;</span> he might have the wherewithal to take her. But that first reason, in the prisoner's own words, was of little weight beside the second. While I have that money on me, he said, I am a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can always go to my insulted betrothed, and, laying down half the sum I have fraudulently appropriated, I can always say to her, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You see, I've squandered half your money, and shown I am a weak and immoral man, and, if you like, a scoundrel&#8217;</span> (I use the prisoner's own expressions), <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;but though I am a scoundrel, I am not a thief, for if I had been a thief, I shouldn't have brought you back this half of the money, but should have taken it as I did the other half!&#8217;</span> A <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page794"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg794"></a> marvelous explanation! This frantic, but weak man, who could not resist the temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at the price of such disgrace, this very man suddenly develops the most stoical firmness, and carries about a thousand roubles without daring to touch it. Does that fit in at all with the character we have analyzed? No, and I venture to tell you how the real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in such circumstances, if he really had brought himself to put away the money.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At the first temptation&#8212;for instance, to entertain the woman with whom he had already squandered half the money&#8212;he would have unpicked his little bag and have taken out some hundred roubles, for why should he have taken back precisely half the money, that is, fifteen hundred roubles? why not fourteen hundred? He could just as well have said then that he was not a thief, because he brought back fourteen hundred roubles. Then another time he would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred, and then a third, and then a fourth, and before the end of the month he would have taken the last note but one, feeling that if he took back only a hundred it would answer the purpose, for a thief would have stolen it all. And then he would have looked at this last note, and have said to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's really not worth while to give back one hundred; let's spend that, too!&#8217;</span> That's how the real Dmitri Karamazov, as we know him, would have behaved. One cannot imagine anything more incongruous with the actual fact than this legend of the little bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable. But we shall return to that later.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">After touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning the financial relations of father and son, and arguing again and again that it was utterly impossible, from the facts known, to determine which was in the wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the medical experts in reference to Mitya's fixed idea about the three thousand owing him.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00102"><span class="c9">Chapter VII. An Historical Survey</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner is out of his mind and, in fact, a maniac. I maintain that he is in his right mind, and that if he had not been, he would have behaved more cleverly. As for his being a maniac, that I would agree with, but only in one point, that is, his fixed idea about the three thousand. Yet I think one might find a much simpler cause than his tendency to insanity. For my part I agree thoroughly with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner's mental faculties have always been normal, and that he has only been irritable and exasperated. The object of the prisoner's continual and violent anger was not the sum itself; there was a special motive at the bottom of it. That motive is jealousy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Here Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner's fatal passion for Grushenka. He began from the moment when the prisoner went to the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;young person's&#8221;</span> lodgings <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;to beat her&#8221;</span>&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I use his own expression,&#8221;</span> the prosecutor explained&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but instead of beating her, he remained there, at her feet. That was the beginning of the passion. At the same time the prisoner's father was captivated by the same young person&#8212;a strange and fatal coincidence, for they both lost their hearts to her simultaneously, though both had known her before. And she inspired in both of them the most violent, characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her own confession: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I was laughing at both of them.&#8217;</span> Yes, the sudden desire to make a jest of them came over her, and she conquered both of them at once. The old man, who worshiped money, at once set aside three thousand roubles as a reward for one visit from her, but soon after that, he would have been happy to lay his property and his name at her feet, if only she would become his lawful wife. We have good evidence of this. As for the prisoner, the tragedy of his fate is evident; it is before us. But such was the young person's <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;game.&#8217;</span> The enchantress gave the unhappy young man no hope until the last moment, when he knelt before her, stretching out hands that were already stained with the blood of his father and rival. It was in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page796"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg796"></a> that position that he was arrested. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Send me to Siberia with him, I have brought him to this, I am most to blame,&#8217;</span> the woman herself cried, in genuine remorse at the moment of his arrest.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr. Rakitin, characterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;She was disillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed, who seduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty, cursed by her respectable family, and taken under the protection of a wealthy old man, whom she still, however, considers as her benefactor. There was perhaps much that was good in her young heart, but it was embittered too early. She became prudent and saved money. She grew sarcastic and resentful against society.&#8217;</span> After this sketch of her character it may well be understood that she might laugh at both of them simply from mischief, from malice.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during which he betrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to his honor, the prisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to madness by continual jealousy&#8212;and of whom? His father! And the worst of it was that the crazy old man was alluring and enticing the object of his affection by means of that very three thousand roubles, which the son looked upon as his own property, part of his inheritance from his mother, of which his father was cheating him. Yes, I admit it was hard to bear! It might well drive a man to madness. It was not the money, but the fact that this money was used with such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Then the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering his father had entered the prisoner's head, and illustrated his theory with facts.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At first he only talked about it in taverns&#8212;he was talking about it all that month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with company, and he likes to tell his companions everything, even his most diabolical and dangerous ideas; he likes to share every thought with others, and expects, for some reason, that those he confides in will meet him with perfect sympathy, enter into all his troubles and anxieties, take his part and not oppose him in anything. If not, he flies into a rage and smashes up everything in the tavern. [Then followed the anecdote about Captain Snegiryov.] Those who heard <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page797"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg797"></a> the prisoner began to think at last that he might mean more than threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threats into actions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the monastery, the conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene of violence when the prisoner had rushed into his father's house just after dinner.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I cannot positively assert,&#8221;</span> the prosecutor continued, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that the prisoner fully intended to murder his father before that incident. Yet the idea had several times presented itself to him, and he had deliberated on it&#8212;for that we have facts, witnesses, and his own words. I confess, gentlemen of the jury,&#8221;</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that till to-day I have been uncertain whether to attribute to the prisoner conscious premeditation. I was firmly convinced that he had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured it, contemplating it as a possibility. He had not definitely considered when and how he might commit the crime.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document was presented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that young lady's exclamation, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It is the plan, the program of the murder!&#8217;</span> That is how she defined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner. And, in fact, from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder was premeditated. It was written two days before, and so we know now for a fact that, forty-eight hours before the perpetration of his terrible design, the prisoner swore that, if he could not get money next day, he would murder his father in order to take the envelope with the notes from under his pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;As soon as Ivan had gone away&#8217;</span>&#8212;you hear that; so he had thought everything out, weighing every circumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had written it. The proof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been committed for the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that is written and signed. The prisoner does not deny his signature.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does not diminish the value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote when drunk what he had planned when sober. Had he not planned it when sober, he would not have written it when drunk. I shall be asked: Then why did he talk about it in taverns? A man who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page798"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg798"></a> premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it to himself. Yes, but he talked about it before he had formed a plan, when he had only the desire, only the impulse to it. Afterwards he talked less about it. On the evening he wrote that letter at the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Metropolis&#8217;</span> tavern, contrary to his custom he was silent, though he had been drinking. He did not play billiards, he sat in a corner, talked to no one. He did indeed turn a shopman out of his seat, but that was done almost unconsciously, because he could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance. It is true that after he had taken the final decision, he must have felt apprehensive that he had talked too much about his design beforehand, and that this might lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards. But there was nothing for it; he could not take his words back, but his luck had served him before, it would serve him again. He believed in his star, you know! I must confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,&#8217;</span> as he writes in his peculiar language, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and if they won't give it to me, there will be bloodshed.&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all Mitya's efforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to Samsonov, his journey to Lyagavy. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Harassed, jeered at, hungry, after selling his watch to pay for the journey (though he tells us he had fifteen hundred roubles on him&#8212;a likely story), tortured by jealousy at having left the object of his affections in the town, suspecting that she would go to Fyodor Pavlovitch in his absence, he returned at last to the town, to find, to his joy, that she had not been near his father. He accompanied her himself to her protector. (Strange to say, he doesn't seem to have been jealous of Samsonov, which is psychologically interesting.) Then he hastens back to his ambush in the back gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in a fit, that the other servant is ill&#8212;the coast is clear and he knows the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;signals&#8217;</span>&#8212;what a temptation! Still he resists it; he goes off to a lady who has for some time been residing in the town, and who is highly esteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who had long watched his career with compassion, gave him the most judicious advice, to give up his dissipated life, his unseemly love-affair, the waste of his youth and vigor in pot-house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to the gold-mines: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;that would be an outlet for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page799"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg799"></a> your turbulent energies, your romantic character, your thirst for adventure.&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">After describing the result of this conversation and the moment when the prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov's, the sudden frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion, at the thought that she had deceived him and was now with his father, Ippolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of chance. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Had the maid told him that her mistress was at Mokroe with her former lover, nothing would have happened. But she lost her head, she could only swear and protest her ignorance, and if the prisoner did not kill her on the spot, it was only because he flew in pursuit of his false mistress.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But note, frantic as he was, he took with him a brass pestle. Why that? Why not some other weapon? But since he had been contemplating his plan and preparing himself for it for a whole month, he would snatch up anything like a weapon that caught his eye. He had realized for a month past that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon, so he instantly, without hesitation, recognized that it would serve his purpose. So it was by no means unconsciously, by no means involuntarily, that he snatched up that fatal pestle. And then we find him in his father's garden&#8212;the coast is clear, there are no witnesses, darkness and jealousy. The suspicion that she was there, with him, with his rival, in his arms, and perhaps laughing at him at that moment&#8212;took his breath away. And it was not mere suspicion, the deception was open, obvious. She must be there, in that lighted room, she must be behind the screen; and the unhappy man would have us believe that he stole up to the window, peeped respectfully in, and discreetly withdrew, for fear something terrible and immoral should happen. And he tries to persuade us of that, us, who understand his character, who know his state of mind at the moment, and that he knew the signals by which he could at once enter the house.&#8221;</span> At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection of Smerdyakov with the murder. He did this very circumstantially, and every one realized that, although he professed to despise that suspicion, he thought the subject of great importance.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00103"><span class="c9">Chapter VIII. A Treatise On Smerdyakov</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?&#8221;</span> (Ippolit Kirillovitch began.) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The first person who cried out that Smerdyakov had committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his arrest, yet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single fact to confirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact. The charge is confirmed by three persons only&#8212;the two brothers of the prisoner and Madame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only to-day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know that for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of his brother's guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of that later. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the slightest fact to support his notion of Smerdyakov's guilt, and has only been led to that conclusion from the prisoner's own words and the expression of his face. Yes, that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice to-day by him. Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What the prisoner tells you, you must believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.&#8217;</span> That is all the evidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons, who are all deeply concerned in the prisoner's fate. And yet the theory of Smerdyakov's guilt has been noised about, has been and is still maintained. Is it credible? Is it conceivable?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Here Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the personality of Smerdyakov, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;who had cut short his life in a fit of insanity.&#8221;</span> He depicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a smattering of education, who had been thrown off his balance by philosophical ideas above his level and certain modern theories of duty, which he learnt in practice from the reckless life of his master, who was also perhaps his father&#8212;Fyodor Pavlovitch; and, theoretically, from various strange philosophical conversations with his master's elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily indulged in this diversion, probably feeling dull or wishing to amuse himself at the valet's expense. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He spoke to me himself of his spiritual condition during <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page801"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg801"></a> the last few days at his father's house,&#8221;</span> Ippolit Kirillovitch explained; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but others too have borne witness to it&#8212;the prisoner himself, his brother, and the servant Grigory&#8212;that is, all who knew him well.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks of epilepsy, had not the courage of a chicken. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He fell at my feet and kissed them,&#8217;</span> the prisoner himself has told us, before he realized how damaging such a statement was to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He is an epileptic chicken,&#8217;</span> he declared about him in his characteristic language. And the prisoner chose him for his confidant (we have his own word for it) and he frightened him into consenting at last to act as a spy for him. In that capacity he deceived his master, revealing to the prisoner the existence of the envelope with the notes in it and the signals by means of which he could get into the house. How could he help telling him, indeed? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He would have killed me, I could see that he would have killed me,&#8217;</span> he said at the inquiry, trembling and shaking even before us, though his tormentor was by that time arrested and could do him no harm. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He suspected me at every instant. In fear and trembling I hastened to tell him every secret to pacify him, that he might see that I had not deceived him and let me off alive.&#8217;</span> Those are his own words. I wrote them down and I remember them. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;When he began shouting at me, I would fall on my knees.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence of his master, ever since he had restored him some money he had lost. So it may be supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs of remorse at having deceived his master, whom he loved as his benefactor. Persons severely afflicted with epilepsy are, so the most skillful doctors tell us, always prone to continual and morbid self-reproach. They worry over their <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;wickedness,&#8217;</span> they are tormented by pangs of conscience, often entirely without cause; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults and crimes. And here we have a man of that type who had really been driven to wrong-doing by terror and intimidation.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible would be the outcome of the situation that was developing before his eyes. When Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just before the catastrophe, Smerdyakov besought him to remain, though <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page802"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg802"></a> he was too timid to tell him plainly what he feared. He confined himself to hints, but his hints were not understood.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a protector, whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come to pass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov's drunken letter, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I shall kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.&#8217;</span> So Ivan Fyodorovitch's presence seemed to every one a guarantee of peace and order in the house.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he went away, and within an hour of his young master's departure Smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But that's perfectly intelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed by terror and despair of a sort, had felt during those last few days that one of the fits from which he had suffered before at moments of strain, might be coming upon him again. The day and hour of such an attack cannot, of course, be foreseen, but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he is likely to have one. So the doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch had driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his lonely and unprotected position, went to the cellar. He went down the stairs wondering if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were to come upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very wonder, brought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks, and he fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this perfectly natural occurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he was shamming an attack <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">on purpose</span></em>. But, if it were on purpose, the question arises at once, what was his motive? What was he reckoning on? What was he aiming at? I say nothing about medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: the doctors were not able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the real. That may be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he for such a counterfeit? Could he, had he been plotting the murder, have desired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit just before?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder, there were five persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch's&#8212;Fyodor Pavlovitch himself (but he did not kill himself, that's evident); then his servant, Grigory, but he was almost killed himself; the third person was Grigory's wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, but it would be simply <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page803"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg803"></a> shameful to imagine her murdering her master. Two persons are left&#8212;the prisoner and Smerdyakov. But, if we are to believe the prisoner's statement that he is not the murderer, then Smerdyakov must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one else can be found. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding accusation against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday. Had a shadow of suspicion rested on any one else, had there been any sixth person, I am persuaded that even the prisoner would have been ashamed to accuse Smerdyakov, and would have accused that sixth person, for to charge Smerdyakov with that murder is perfectly absurd.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine, let us even lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what the facts tell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how did he do it? Alone or with the assistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the first alternative&#8212;that he did it alone. If he had killed him it must have been with some object, for some advantage to himself. But not having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder&#8212;hatred, jealousy, and so on&#8212;Smerdyakov could only have murdered him for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate the three thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope. And yet he tells another person&#8212;and a person most closely interested, that is, the prisoner&#8212;everything about the money and the signals, where the envelope lay, what was written on it, what it was tied up with, and, above all, told him of those signals by which he could enter the house. Did he do this simply to betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one who would be anxious to get that envelope for himself? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes,&#8217;</span> I shall be told, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;but he betrayed it from fear.&#8217;</span> But how do you explain this? A man who could conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tells facts which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he held his tongue, no one would ever have guessed!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a crime, nothing would have induced him to tell any one about the envelope and the signals, for that was as good as betraying himself beforehand. He would have invented something, he would have told some lie if he had been forced to give information, but he would have been silent about that. For, on the other hand, if he had said <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page804"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg804"></a> nothing about the money, but had committed the murder and stolen the money, no one in the world could have charged him with murder for the sake of robbery, since no one but he had seen the money, no one but he knew of its existence in the house. Even if he had been accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he had committed it from some other motive. But since no one had observed any such motive in him beforehand, and every one saw, on the contrary, that his master was fond of him and honored him with his confidence, he would, of course, have been the last to be suspected. People would have suspected first the man who had a motive, a man who had himself declared he had such motives, who had made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected the son of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov killed and robbed him, and the son been accused of it, that would, of course, have suited Smerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that, though plotting the murder, he told that son, Dmitri, about the money, the envelope, and the signals? Is that logical? Is that clear?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we have him falling downstairs in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">feigned</span></em> fit&#8212;with what object? In the first place that Grigory, who had been intending to take his medicine, might put it off and remain on guard, seeing there was no one to look after the house, and, in the second place, I suppose, that his master seeing that there was no one to guard him, and in terror of a visit from his son, might redouble his vigilance and precaution. And, most of all, I suppose that he, Smerdyakov, disabled by the fit, might be carried from the kitchen, where he always slept, apart from all the rest, and where he could go in and out as he liked, to Grigory's room at the other end of the lodge, where he was always put, shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed. This was the immemorial custom established by his master and the kind-hearted Marfa Ignatyevna, whenever he had a fit. There, lying behind the screen, he would most likely, to keep up the sham, have begun groaning, and so keeping them awake all night (as Grigory and his wife testified). And all this, we are to believe, that he might more conveniently get up and murder his master!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he might not be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page805"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg805"></a> and the signals to tempt him to commit the murder, and when he had murdered him and had gone away with the money, making a noise, most likely, and waking people, Smerdyakov got up, am I to believe, and went in&#8212;what for? To murder his master a second time and carry off the money that had already been stolen? Gentlemen, are you laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions, but, incredible as it seems, that's just what the prisoner alleges. When he had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised an alarm, he tells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his master and stole the money! I won't press the point that Smerdyakov could hardly have reckoned on this beforehand, and have foreseen that the furious and exasperated son would simply come to peep in respectfully, though he knew the signals, and beat a retreat, leaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I put this question to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov could have committed his crime? Name that moment, or you can't accuse him.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered, heard a shout, and went out. Well&#8212;what then? He looked about him and said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why not go and kill the master?&#8217;</span> And how did he know what had happened, since he had been lying unconscious till that moment? But there's a limit to these flights of fancy.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Quite so,&#8217;</span> some astute people will tell me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;but what if they were in agreement? What if they murdered him together and shared the money&#8212;what then?&#8217;</span> A weighty question, truly! And the facts to confirm it are astounding. One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit, apparently to arouse suspicion in every one, alarm in his master and alarm in Grigory. It would be interesting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane plan.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov's part, but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing that he would be blamed for letting his master be murdered, without screaming for help or resisting, he may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by shamming <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page806"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg806"></a> a fit&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;you may murder him as you like; it's nothing to me.&#8217;</span> But as this attack of Smerdyakov's was bound to throw the household into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such a plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he did agree, it would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer and the instigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and not even an accomplice, but merely acquiesced against his will through terror.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly throws all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of being his accomplice, but of being himself the murderer. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He did it alone,&#8217;</span> he says. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He murdered and robbed him. It was the work of his hands.&#8217;</span> Strange sort of accomplices who begin to accuse one another at once! And think of the risk for Karamazov. After committing the murder while his accomplice lay in bed, he throws the blame on the invalid, who might well have resented it and in self-preservation might well have confessed the truth. For he might well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he was responsible, and so he might well have reckoned that if he were punished, it would be far less severely than the real murderer. But in that case he would have been certain to make a confession, yet he has not done so. Smerdyakov never hinted at their complicity, though the actual murderer persisted in accusing him and declaring that he had committed the crime alone.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement that it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">he</span></em> who had told the prisoner of the envelope of notes and of the signals, and that, but for him, he would have known nothing about them. If he had really been a guilty accomplice, would he so readily have made this statement at the inquiry? On the contrary, he would have tried to conceal it, to distort the facts or minimize them. But he was far from distorting or minimizing them. No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of being charged with complicity, could have acted as he did. And in a fit of melancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he hanged himself yesterday. He left a note written in his peculiar language, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I destroy myself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no blame on any one.&#8217;</span> What would it have cost him to add: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page807"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg807"></a> the murderer, not Karamazov&#8217;</span>? But that he did not add. Did his conscience lead him to suicide and not to avowing his guilt?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were brought into the court just now, and we were told that they were the same that lay in the envelope now on the table before us, and that the witness had received them from Smerdyakov the day before. But I need not recall the painful scene, though I will make one or two comments, selecting such trivial ones as might not be obvious at first sight to every one, and so may be overlooked. In the first place, Smerdyakov must have given back the money and hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he confessed his guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us. If it were not so, indeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept silence till now? And so, if he has confessed, then why, I ask again, did he not avow the whole truth in the last letter he left behind, knowing that the innocent prisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next day?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the fact came to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court that Ivan Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons of five thousand each&#8212;that is, ten thousand in all&#8212;to the chief town of the province to be changed. I only mention this to point out that any one may have money, and that it can't be proved that these notes are the same as were in Fyodor Pavlovitch's envelope.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of such importance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why didn't he report it at once? Why did he put it all off till morning? I think I have a right to conjecture why. His health had been giving way for a week past: he had admitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that he was suffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on the eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been stricken down to-day. In this condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov's death, and at once reflected, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save my brother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that Smerdyakov gave them me before his death.&#8217;</span> You will say that was dishonorable: it's dishonorable to slander even the dead, and even to save a brother. True, but what if he slandered him unconsciously? <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page808"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg808"></a> What if, finally unhinged by the sudden news of the valet's death, he imagined it really was so? You saw the recent scene: you have seen the witness's condition. He was standing up and was speaking, but where was his mind?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then followed the document, the prisoner's letter written two days before the crime, and containing a complete program of the murder. Why, then, are we looking for any other program? The crime was committed precisely according to this program, and by no other than the writer of it. Yes, gentlemen of the jury, it went off without a hitch! He did not run respectfully and timidly away from his father's window, though he was firmly convinced that the object of his affections was with him. No, that is absurd and unlikely! He went in and murdered him. Most likely he killed him in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he looked on his hated rival. But having killed him, probably with one blow of the brass pestle, and having convinced himself, after careful search, that she was not there, he did not, however, forget to put his hand under the pillow and take out the envelope, the torn cover of which lies now on the table before us.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very characteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer and had he committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would he have left the torn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside the corpse? Had it been Smerdyakov, for instance, murdering his master to rob him, he would have simply carried away the envelope with him, without troubling himself to open it over his victim's corpse, for he would have known for certain that the notes were in the envelope&#8212;they had been put in and sealed up in his presence&#8212;and had he taken the envelope with him, no one would ever have known of the robbery. I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov have behaved in that way? Would he have left the envelope on the floor?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who was not a thief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched the notes from under the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but as though seizing his own property from the thief who had stolen it. For that was the idea which had become almost an insane obsession in Dmitri Karamazov in regard to that money. And pouncing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page809"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg809"></a> upon the envelope, which he had never seen before, he tore it open to make sure whether the money was in it, and ran away with the money in his pocket, even forgetting to consider that he had left an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope on the floor. All because it was Karamazov, not Smerdyakov, he didn't think, he didn't reflect, and how should he? He ran away; he heard behind him the servant cry out; the old man caught him, stopped him and was felled to the ground by the brass pestle.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would you believe it, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of compassion, to see whether he could do anything for him. Was that a moment to show compassion? No; he jumped down simply to make certain whether the only witness of his crime were dead or alive. Any other feeling, any other motive would be unnatural. Note that he took trouble over Grigory, wiped his head with his handkerchief and, convincing himself he was dead, he ran to the house of his mistress, dazed and covered with blood. How was it he never thought that he was covered with blood and would be at once detected? But the prisoner himself assures us that he did not even notice that he was covered with blood. That may be believed, that is very possible, that always happens at such moments with criminals. On one point they will show diabolical cunning, while another will escape them altogether. But he was thinking at that moment of one thing only&#8212;where was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">she</span></em>? He wanted to find out at once where she was, so he ran to her lodging and learnt an unexpected and astounding piece of news&#8212;she had gone off to Mokroe to meet her first lover.&#8221;</span></p>
