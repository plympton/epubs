</h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a little more than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey's three horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter. The swift motion revived Mitya. The air was fresh and cool, there were big stars shining in the sky. It was the very night, and perhaps the very hour, in which Alyosha fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">All was confusion, confusion, in Mitya's soul, but although many things were goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was yearning for her, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time. One thing I can say for certain; his heart did not waver for one instant. I shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous lover felt not the slightest jealousy of this new rival, who seemed to have sprung out of the earth. If any other had appeared on the scene, he would have been jealous at once, and would perhaps have stained his fierce hands with blood again. But as he flew through the night, he felt no envy, no hostility even, for the man who had been her first lover.... It is true he had not yet seen him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg460"></a> this was her first love which, after five years, she had not forgotten; so she had loved him only for those five years, and I, how do I come in? What right have I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way! What am I now? Now everything is over apart from the officer&#8212;even if he had not appeared, everything would be over ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">These words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had been capable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment. His present plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenya's first words, it had sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a flash, with all its consequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution, there was confusion in his soul, an agonizing confusion: his resolution did not give him peace. There was so much behind that tortured him. And it seemed strange to him, at moments, to think that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and paper: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I punish myself,&#8221;</span> and the paper was lying there in his pocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how, next morning, he would meet the first warm ray of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;golden-haired Ph&#339;bus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left behind and that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the thought of it sank into his heart with despair. There was one moment when he felt an impulse to stop Andrey, to jump out of the cart, to pull out his loaded pistol, and to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn. But that moment flew by like a spark. The horses galloped on, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;devouring space,&#8221;</span> and as he drew near his goal, again the thought of her, of her alone, took more and more complete possession of his soul, chasing away the fearful images that had been haunting it. Oh, how he longed to look upon her, if only for a moment, if only from a distance!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's now with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">him</span></em>,&#8221;</span> he thought, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;now I shall see what she looks like with him, her first love, and that's all I want.&#8221;</span> Never had this woman, who was such a fateful influence in his life, aroused such love in his breast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising even to himself, a feeling tender to devoutness, to self-effacement before her! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will efface myself!&#8221;</span> he said, in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and though Andrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg461"></a> a word, either. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up smartly his three lean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya cried out in horrible anxiety:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Andrey! What if they're asleep?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">This thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to him before.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It may well be that they're gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he was rushing there ... with such feelings ... while they were asleep ... she was asleep, perhaps, there too.... An angry feeling surged up in his heart.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!&#8221;</span> he cried, beside himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But maybe they're not in bed!&#8221;</span> Andrey went on after a pause. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Timofey said they were a lot of them there&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At the station?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov's, at the inn, where they let out horses, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How's that? Who are they?&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, Timofey was saying they're all gentlefolk. Two from our town&#8212;who they are I can't say&#8212;and there are two others, strangers, maybe more besides. I didn't ask particularly. They've set to playing cards, so Timofey said.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Cards?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So, maybe they're not in bed if they're at cards. It's most likely not more than eleven.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!&#8221;</span> Mitya cried again, nervously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;May I ask you something, sir?&#8221;</span> said Andrey, after a pause. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only I'm afraid of angering you, sir.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you not to harm her mistress, and some one else, too ... so you see, sir&#8212; It's I am taking you there ... forgive me, sir, it's my conscience ... maybe it's stupid of me to speak of it&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg462"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you a driver?&#8221;</span> he asked frantically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then you know that one has to make way. What would you say to a driver who wouldn't make way for any one, but would just drive on and crush people? No, a driver mustn't run over people. One can't run over a man. One can't spoil people's lives. And if you have spoilt a life&#8212;punish yourself.... If only you've spoilt, if only you've ruined any one's life&#8212;punish yourself and go away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though Andrey was surprised at him, he kept up the conversation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you're quite right, one mustn't crush or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every creature is created by God. Take a horse, for instance, for some folks, even among us drivers, drive anyhow. Nothing will restrain them, they just force it along.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To hell?&#8221;</span> Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt, short laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Andrey, simple soul,&#8221;</span> he seized him by the shoulders again, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;tell me, will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not, what do you think?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... you see, sir, when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He went straight down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that were in agony. And the devil groaned, because he thought that he would get no more sinners in hell. And God said to him, then, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Don't groan, for you shall have all the mighty of the earth, the rulers, the chief judges, and the rich men, and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till I come again.&#8217;</span> Those were His very words ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So you see, sir, who it is hell's for,&#8221;</span> said Andrey, whipping up the left horse, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but you're like a little child ... that's how we look on you ... and though you're hasty-tempered, sir, yet God will forgive you for your kind heart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What should I forgive you for, sir? You've never done me any harm.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg463"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road, will you forgive me for every one? Speak, simple peasant heart!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering to himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn me. Let me pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for I have condemned myself, do not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord. I am a wretch, but I love Thee. If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love Thee there, and from there I shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever.... But let me love to the end.... Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of Thy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I cannot help loving her. Thou seest my whole heart.... I shall gallop up, I shall fall before her and say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You are right to pass on and leave me. Farewell and forget your victim ... never fret yourself about me!&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mokroe!&#8221;</span> cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass of buildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The village of Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour all were asleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Drive on, Andrey, I come!&#8221;</span> Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They're not asleep,&#8221;</span> said Andrey again, pointing with his whip to the Plastunovs' inn, which was at the entrance to the village. The six windows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They're not asleep,&#8221;</span> Mitya repeated joyously. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Quicker, Andrey! Gallop! Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know that I have come. I'm coming! I'm coming, too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Andrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash and pulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way to bed, peeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps, and rushed up to the guest with obsequious delight.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg464"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Trifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle height, with a rather fat face. His expression was severe and uncompromising, especially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had the power of assuming the most obsequious countenance, when he had an inkling that it was to his interest. He dressed in Russian style, with a shirt buttoning down on one side, and a full-skirted coat. He had saved a good sum of money, but was for ever dreaming of improving his position. More than half the peasants were in his clutches, every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him. From the neighboring landowners he bought and rented lands which were worked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could never shake off. He was a widower, with four grown-up daughters. One of them was already a widow and lived in the inn with her two children, his grandchildren, and worked for him like a charwoman. Another of his daughters was married to a petty official, and in one of the rooms of the inn, on the wall could be seen, among the family photographs, a miniature photograph of this official in uniform and official epaulettes. The two younger daughters used to wear fashionable blue or green dresses, fitting tight at the back, and with trains a yard long, on Church holidays or when they went to pay visits. But next morning they would get up at dawn, as usual, sweep out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and clean up after lodgers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon Borissovitch was very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest, and remembering that not a month ago he had, in twenty-four hours, made two if not three hundred roubles out of Dmitri, when he had come on his escapade with Grushenka, he met him now with eager welcome, scenting his prey the moment Mitya drove up to the steps.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, Trifon Borissovitch,&#8221;</span> began Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;first and foremost, where is she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Agrafena Alexandrovna?&#8221;</span> The inn-keeper understood at once, looking sharply into Mitya's face. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's here, too ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;With whom? With whom?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Some strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge from his speech. He sent the horses for her from here; and there's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg465"></a> another with him, a friend of his, or a fellow traveler, there's no telling. They're dressed like civilians.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, are they feasting? Have they money?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Poor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nothing to boast of? And who are the others?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They're two gentlemen from the town.... They've come back from Tcherny, and are putting up here. One's quite a young gentleman, a relative of Mr. Mi&#252;sov, he must be, but I've forgotten his name ... and I expect you know the other, too, a gentleman called Maximov. He's been on a pilgrimage, so he says, to the monastery in the town. He's traveling with this young relation of Mr. Mi&#252;sov.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing: What of her? How is she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, she's only just come. She's sitting with them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is she cheerful? Is she laughing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I think she's not laughing much. She's sitting quite dull. She's combing the young gentleman's hair.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The Pole&#8212;the officer?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's not young, and he's not an officer, either. Not him, sir. It's the young gentleman that's Mr. Mi&#252;sov's relation ... I've forgotten his name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Kalganov.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's it, Kalganov!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;All right. I'll see for myself. Are they playing cards?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They have been playing, but they've left off. They've been drinking tea, the official gentleman asked for liqueurs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I'll see for myself. Now answer one more question: are the gypsies here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You can't have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The authorities have sent them away. But we've Jews that play the cymbals and the fiddle in the village, so one might send for them. They'd come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Send for them. Certainly send for them!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you can get the girls together as you did then, Marya especially, Stepanida, too, and Arina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg466"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though by now they're asleep. Are the peasants here worth such kindness, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like that on such coarseness and rudeness! What's the good of giving a peasant a cigar to smoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are all lousy. Besides, I'll get my daughters up for nothing, let alone a sum like that. They've only just gone to bed, I'll give them a kick and set them singing for you. You gave the peasants champagne to drink the other day, e&#8212;ech!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">For all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch had hidden half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion, and had picked up a hundred-rouble note under the table, and it had remained in his clutches.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last time I was here. Do you remember?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have left three thousand behind you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, I've come to do the same again, do you see?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the innkeeper's nose.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now, listen and remember. In an hour's time the wine will arrive, savories, pies, and sweets&#8212;bring them all up at once. That box Andrey has got is to be brought up at once, too. Open it, and hand champagne immediately. And the girls, we must have the girls, Marya especially.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here, Andrey, let's settle. Here's fifteen roubles for the drive, and fifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love.... Remember Karamazov!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm afraid, sir,&#8221;</span> faltered Andrey. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give me five roubles extra, but more I won't take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive my foolish words ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you afraid of?&#8221;</span> asked Mitya, scanning him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, go to the devil, if that's it!&#8221;</span> he cried, flinging him five roubles. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now, Trifon Borissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them, so that they don't see me. Where are they? In the blue room?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg467"></a> obediently did his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went himself into the first large room, adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting, and took the light away. Then he stealthily led Mitya in, and put him in a corner in the dark, whence he could freely watch the company without being seen. But Mitya did not look long, and, indeed, he could not see them, he saw her, his heart throbbed violently, and all was dark before his eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside her, on the sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding his hand and seemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and not looking at her, was saying something in a loud voice to Maximov, who sat the other side of the table, facing Grushenka. Maximov was laughing violently at something. On the sofa sat <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">he</span></em>, and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger. The one on the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya had an impression of a stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who was apparently angry about something. His friend, the other stranger, struck Mitya as extraordinarily tall, but he could make out nothing more. He caught his breath. He could not bear it for a minute, he put the pistol-case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he walked, feeling cold all over, straight into the blue room to face the company.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Aie!&#8221;</span> shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00063"><span class="c9">Chapter VII. The First And Rightful Lover</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">With his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the table.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221;</span> he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering at every word, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I ... I'm all right! Don't be afraid!&#8221;</span> he exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I&#8212;there's nothing the matter,&#8221;</span> he turned suddenly to Grushenka, who had shrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov, and clasped his hand tightly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I ... I'm coming, too. I'm here till morning. Gentlemen, may I stay with you till morning? Only till morning, for the last time, in this same room?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg468"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting on the sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity and observed severely:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panie</span></span>, we're here in private. There are other rooms.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, it's you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?&#8221;</span> answered Kalganov suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Sit down with us. How are you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Delighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always thought a lot of you.&#8221;</span> Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at once holding out his hand across the table.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Aie! How tight you squeeze! You've quite broken my fingers,&#8221;</span> laughed Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He always squeezes like that, always,&#8221;</span> Grushenka put in gayly, with a timid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya's face that he was not going to make a scene. She was watching him with intense curiosity and still some uneasiness. She was impressed by something about him, and indeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in and speak like this at such a moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good evening,&#8221;</span> Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya rushed up to him, too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good evening. You're here, too! How glad I am to find you here, too! Gentlemen, gentlemen, I&#8212;&#8221;</span> (He addressed the Polish gentleman with the pipe again, evidently taking him for the most important person present.) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I flew here.... I wanted to spend my last day, my last hour in this room, in this very room ... where I, too, adored ... my queen.... Forgive me, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> he cried wildly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I flew here and vowed&#8212; Oh, don't be afraid, it's my last night! Let's drink to our good understanding. They'll bring the wine at once.... I brought this with me.&#8221;</span> (Something made him pull out his bundle of notes.) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Allow me, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>! I want to have music, singing, a revel, as we had before. But the worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawl away, and there'll be no more of him. I will commemorate my day of joy on my last night.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted to say, but strange exclamations were all that came from his lips. The Pole gazed fixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand; looked at Grushenka, and was in evident perplexity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If my suverin lady is permitting&#8212;&#8221;</span> he was beginning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What does <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;suverin&#8217;</span> mean? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Sovereign,&#8217;</span> I suppose?&#8221;</span> interrupted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg469"></a> Grushenka. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I can't help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit down, Mitya, what are you talking about? Don't frighten us, please. You won't frighten us, will you? If you won't, I am glad to see you ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Me, me frighten you?&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, pass me by, go your way, I won't hinder you!...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as well, by flinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning his head away to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped the back of the chair tight, as though embracing it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, come, what a fellow you are!&#8221;</span> cried Grushenka reproachfully. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's just how he comes to see me&#8212;he begins talking, and I can't make out what he means. He cried like that once before, and now he's crying again! It's shameful! Why are you crying? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">As though you had anything to cry for!</span></em>&#8221;</span> she added enigmatically, emphasizing each word with some irritability.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I ... I'm not crying.... Well, good evening!&#8221;</span> He instantly turned round in his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his abrupt wooden laugh, but a long, quivering, inaudible nervous laugh.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!&#8221;</span> Grushenka said to him persuasively. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm very glad you've come, very glad, Mitya, do you hear, I'm very glad! I want him to stay here with us,&#8221;</span> she said peremptorily, addressing the whole company, though her words were obviously meant for the man sitting on the sofa. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wish it, I wish it! And if he goes away I shall go, too!&#8221;</span> she added with flashing eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What my queen commands is law!&#8221;</span> pronounced the Pole, gallantly kissing Grushenka's hand. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I beg you, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>, to join our company,&#8221;</span> he added politely, addressing Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering another tirade, but the words did not come.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let's drink, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> he blurted out instead of making a speech. Every one laughed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!&#8221;</span> Grushenka exclaimed nervously. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you hear, Mitya,&#8221;</span> she went on insistently, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;don't prance about, but it's nice you've brought the champagne. I want some myself, and I can't bear liqueurs. And <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page470"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg470"></a> best of all, you've come yourself. We were fearfully dull here.... You've come for a spree again, I suppose? But put your money in your pocket. Where did you get such a lot?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled bundle of notes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were fixed. In confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket. He flushed. At that moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked bottle of champagne, and glasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up the bottle, but he was so bewildered that he did not know what to do with it. Kalganov took it from him and poured out the champagne.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Another! Another bottle!&#8221;</span> Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and, forgetting to clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly invited to drink to their good understanding, he drank off his glass without waiting for any one else. His whole countenance suddenly changed. The solemn and tragic expression with which he had entered vanished completely, and a look of something childlike came into his face. He seemed to have become suddenly gentle and subdued. He looked shyly and happily at every one, with a continual nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog who has done wrong, been punished, and forgiven. He seemed to have forgotten everything, and was looking round at every one with a childlike smile of delight. He looked at Grushenka, laughing continually, and bringing his chair close up to her. By degrees he had gained some idea of the two Poles, though he had formed no definite conception of them yet.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and his Polish accent; and, above all, by his pipe. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, what of it? It's a good thing he's smoking a pipe,&#8221;</span> he reflected. The Pole's puffy, middle-aged face, with its tiny nose and two very thin, pointed, dyed and impudent-looking mustaches, had not so far roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was not even particularly struck by the Pole's absurd wig made in Siberia, with love-locks foolishly combed forward over the temples. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I suppose it's all right since he wears a wig,&#8221;</span> he went on, musing blissfully. The other, younger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company and listening to the conversation with silent contempt, still only impressed Mitya by his great height, which was in striking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg471"></a> contrast to the Pole on the sofa. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If he stood up he'd be six foot three.&#8221;</span> The thought flitted through Mitya's mind. It occurred to him, too, that this Pole must be the friend of the other, as it were, a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;bodyguard,&#8221;</span> and no doubt the big Pole was at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemed to Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his mood of doglike submissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grushenka's mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he completely failed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling heart, was that she was kind to him, that she had forgiven him, and made him sit by her. He was beside himself with delight, watching her sip her glass of champagne. The silence of the company seemed somehow to strike him, however, and he looked round at every one with expectant eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don't you begin doing something?&#8221;</span> his smiling eyes seemed to ask.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,&#8221;</span> Kalganov began suddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing to Maximov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's talking nonsense?&#8221;</span> he laughed, his short, wooden laugh, seeming suddenly delighted at something&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;ha ha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry officers in the twenties married Polish women. That's awful rot, isn't it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Polish women?&#8221;</span> repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kalganov was well aware of Mitya's attitude to Grushenka, and he guessed about the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest him, perhaps did not interest him at all; what he was interested in was Maximov. He had come here with Maximov by chance, and he met the Poles here at the inn for the first time in his life. Grushenka he knew before, and had once been with some one to see her; but she had not taken to him. But here she looked at him very affectionately: before Mitya's arrival, she had been making much of him, but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it. He was a boy, not over twenty, dressed like a dandy, with a very charming fair-skinned face, and splendid thick, fair hair. From his fair face looked out beautiful pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg472"></a> sometimes even deep expression, beyond his age indeed, although the young man sometimes looked and talked quite like a child, and was not at all ashamed of it, even when he was aware of it himself. As a rule he was very willful, even capricious, though always friendly. Sometimes there was something fixed and obstinate in his expression. He would look at you and listen, seeming all the while to be persistently dreaming over something else. Often he was listless and lazy, at other times he would grow excited, sometimes, apparently, over the most trivial matters.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only imagine, I've been taking him about with me for the last four days,&#8221;</span> he went on, indolently drawling his words, quite naturally though, without the slightest affectation. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ever since your brother, do you remember, shoved him off the carriage and sent him flying. That made me take an interest in him at the time, and I took him into the country, but he keeps talking such rot I'm ashamed to be with him. I'm taking him back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is impossible,&#8221;</span> the Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he pretended. If he used Russian words, he always distorted them into a Polish form.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I was married to a Polish lady myself,&#8221;</span> tittered Maximov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the cavalry. Were you a cavalry officer?&#8221;</span> put in Kalganov at once.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, listening eagerly, and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as though there were no knowing what he might hear from each.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, you see,&#8221;</span> Maximov turned to him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What I mean is that those pretty Polish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ... when one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on his knee like a kitten ... a little white one ... and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">pan</span></span>-father and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">pan</span></span>-mother look on and allow it.... They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes and offers her his hand.... That's how it is ... offers her his hand, he he!&#8221;</span> Maximov ended, tittering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">pan</span></span> is a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">lajdak</span></span>!&#8221;</span> the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly and crossed one leg over the other. Mitya's eye was caught <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg473"></a> by his huge greased boot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of both the Poles looked rather greasy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, now it's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">lajdak</span></span>! What's he scolding about?&#8221;</span> said Grushenka, suddenly vexed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Pani</span></span> Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant girls, and not ladies of good birth,&#8221;</span> the Pole with the pipe observed to Grushenka.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You can reckon on that,&#8221;</span> the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It makes it cheerful,&#8221;</span> Grushenka said crossly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm not hindering them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">pani</span></span>,&#8221;</span> said the Pole in the wig, with a long look at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he sucked his pipe again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.&#8221;</span> Kalganov got excited again, as though it were a question of vast import. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's never been in Poland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you weren't married in Poland, were you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought her to Russia before that, my future wife, with her mamma and her aunt, and another female relation with a grown-up son. He brought her straight from Poland and gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant in our regiment, a very nice young man. At first he meant to marry her himself. But he didn't marry her, because she turned out to be lame.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So you married a lame woman?&#8221;</span> cried Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed it. I thought she was hopping; she kept hopping.... I thought it was for fun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So pleased she was going to marry you!&#8221;</span> yelled Kalganov, in a ringing, childish voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause. Afterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very evening, she confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I once jumped over a puddle when I was a child,&#8217;</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and injured my leg.&#8217;</span> He he!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling on the sofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg474"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know, that's the truth, he's not lying now,&#8221;</span> exclaimed Kalganov, turning to Mitya; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and do you know, he's been married twice; it's his first wife he's talking about. But his second wife, do you know, ran away, and is alive now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221;</span> said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with an expression of the utmost astonishment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. She did run away. I've had that unpleasant experience,&#8221;</span> Maximov modestly assented, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;with a <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">monsieur</span></span>. And what was worse, she'd had all my little property transferred to her beforehand. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You're an educated man,&#8217;</span> she said to me. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You can always get your living.&#8217;</span> She settled my business with that. A venerable bishop once said to me: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;One of your wives was lame, but the other was too light-footed.&#8217;</span> He he!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, listen!&#8221;</span> cried Kalganov, bubbling over, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;if he's telling lies&#8212;and he often is&#8212;he's only doing it to amuse us all. There's no harm in that, is there? You know, I sometimes like him. He's awfully low, but it's natural to him, eh? Don't you think so? Some people are low from self-interest, but he's simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he claims (he was arguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol wrote <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Dead Souls</span></span> about him. Do you remember, there's a landowner called Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.&#8217;</span> Would you believe it, he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten! Now can it be so? Tchitchikov made his journey, at the very latest, at the beginning of the twenties, so that the dates don't fit. He couldn't have been thrashed then, he couldn't, could he?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but his excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without protest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, but if they did thrash him!&#8221;</span> he cried, laughing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is&#8212;&#8221;</span> put in Maximov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn't.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What o'clock is it, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>?&#8221;</span> the Pole, with the pipe, asked his tall friend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his shoulders in reply. Neither of them had a watch.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg475"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn't other people talk because you're bored?&#8221;</span> Grushenka flew at him with evident intention of finding fault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mitya's mind. This time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Pani</span></span>, I didn't oppose it. I didn't say anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;All right then. Come, tell us your story,&#8221;</span> Grushenka cried to Maximov. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why are you all silent?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's nothing to tell, it's all so foolish,&#8221;</span> answered Maximov at once, with evident satisfaction, mincing a little. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Besides, all that's by way of allegory in Gogol, for he's made all the names have a meaning. Nozdryov was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name, he was called Shkvornev. Fenardi really was called Fenardi, only he wasn't an Italian but a Russian, and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in tights, and she had a little short skirt with spangles, and she kept turning round and round, only not for four hours but for four minutes only, and she bewitched every one...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what were you beaten for?&#8221;</span> cried Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For Piron!&#8221;</span> answered Maximov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What Piron?&#8221;</span> cried Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a big party of us, in a tavern at that very fair. They'd invited me, and first of all I began quoting epigrams. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Is that you, Boileau? What a funny get-up!&#8217;</span> and Boileau answers that he's going to a masquerade, that is to the baths, he he! And they took it to themselves, so I made haste to repeat another, very sarcastic, well known to all educated people:</span></p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we!</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">But one grief is weighing on me.</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">You don't know your way to the sea!</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly way for it. And as ill-luck would have it, to set things right, I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how he was not accepted into the French Academy, and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph:</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg476"></a>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Ci-g&#238;t Piron qui ne fut rien,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Pas m&#234;me acad&#233;micien.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">They seized me and thrashed me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what for? What for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For my education. People can thrash a man for anything,&#8221;</span> Maximov concluded, briefly and sententiously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Eh, that's enough! That's all stupid, I don't want to listen. I thought it would be amusing,&#8221;</span> Grushenka cut them short, suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya started, and at once left off laughing. The tall Pole rose upon his feet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out of his element, began pacing from corner to corner of the room, his hands behind his back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, he can't sit still,&#8221;</span> said Grushenka, looking at him contemptuously. Mitya began to feel anxious. He noticed besides, that the Pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable expression.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panie!</span></span>&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;let's drink! and the other <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pan</span></span>, too! Let us drink.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him, and filled them with champagne.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To Poland, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie</span></span>, I drink to your Poland!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall be delighted, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> said the Pole on the sofa, with dignity and affable condescension, and he took his glass.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And the other <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pan</span></span>, what's his name? Drink, most illustrious, take your glass!&#8221;</span> Mitya urged.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Pan Vrublevsky,&#8221;</span> put in the Pole on the sofa.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he walked.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To Poland, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie!</span></span>&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, raising his glass. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">All three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three glasses.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now to Russia, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie</span></span>, and let us be brothers!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Pour out some for us,&#8221;</span> said Grushenka; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll drink to Russia, too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So will I,&#8221;</span> said Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I would, too ... to Russia, the old grandmother!&#8221;</span> tittered Maximov.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg477"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;All! All!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Trifon Borissovitch, some more bottles!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table. Mitya filled the glasses.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To Russia! Hurrah!&#8221;</span> he shouted again. All drank the toast except the Poles, and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once. The Poles did not touch theirs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How's this, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie</span></span>?&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;won't you drink it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Pan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a resonant voice:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To Russia as she was before 1772.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, that's better!&#8221;</span> cried the other Pole, and they both emptied their glasses at once.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're fools, you <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> broke suddenly from Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panie!</span></span>&#8221;</span> shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya like a couple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can one help loving one's own country?&#8221;</span> he shouted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Be silent! Don't quarrel! I won't have any quarreling!&#8221;</span> cried Grushenka imperiously, and she stamped her foot on the floor. Her face glowed, her eyes were shining. The effects of the glass she had just drunk were apparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panovie</span></span>, forgive me! It was my fault, I'm sorry. Vrublevsky, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span> Vrublevsky, I'm sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!&#8221;</span> Grushenka scolded with angry annoyance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Every one sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen, I was the cause of it all,&#8221;</span> Mitya began again, unable to make anything of Grushenka's words. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, why are we sitting here? What shall we do ... to amuse ourselves again?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ach, it's certainly anything but amusing!&#8221;</span> Kalganov mumbled lazily.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let's play faro again, as we did just now,&#8221;</span> Maximov tittered suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Faro? Splendid!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If only the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie</span></span>&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's lite, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> the Pole on the sofa responded, as it were unwillingly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's true,&#8221;</span> assented Pan Vrublevsky.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Lite? What do you mean by <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;lite&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span> asked Grushenka.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg478"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Late, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pani</span></span>! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;a late hour&#8217;</span> I mean,&#8221;</span> the Pole on the sofa explained.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's always late with them. They can never do anything!&#8221;</span> Grushenka almost shrieked in her anger. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They're dull themselves, so they want others to be dull. Before you came, Mitya, they were just as silent and kept turning up their noses at me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My goddess!&#8221;</span> cried the Pole on the sofa, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see you're not well-disposed to me, that's why I'm gloomy. I'm ready, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> added he, addressing Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Begin, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> Mitya assented, pulling his notes out of his pocket, and laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I want to lose a lot to you. Take your cards. Make the bank.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We'll have cards from the landlord, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> said the little Pole, gravely and emphatically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's much the best way,&#8221;</span> chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From the landlord? Very good, I understand, let's get them from him. Cards!&#8221;</span> Mitya shouted to the landlord.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed Mitya that the girls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the cymbals would most likely be here soon; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived. Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders, but only three girls had arrived, and Marya was not there yet. And he did not know himself what orders to give and why he had run out. He only told them to take out of the box the presents for the girls, the sweets, the toffee and the fondants. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And vodka for Andrey, vodka for Andrey!&#8221;</span> he cried in haste. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was rude to Andrey!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Suddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, touched him on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give me five roubles,&#8221;</span> he whispered to Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll stake something at faro, too, he he!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Capital! Splendid! Take ten, here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten roubles. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And if you lose that, come again, come again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very good,&#8221;</span> Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again. Mitya, too, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting. The Poles had already sat down, and opened the pack. They looked much more amiable, almost cordial. The Pole on the sofa <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page479"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg479"></a> had lighted another pipe and was preparing to throw. He wore an air of solemnity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To your places, gentlemen,&#8221;</span> cried Pan Vrublevsky.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I'm not going to play any more,&#8221;</span> observed Kalganov, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've lost fifty roubles to them just now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pan</span></span> had no luck, perhaps he'll be lucky this time,&#8221;</span> the Pole on the sofa observed in his direction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How much in the bank? To correspond?&#8221;</span> asked Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's according, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>, maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, as much as you will stake.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A million!&#8221;</span> laughed Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What Podvysotsky?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it. Podvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against the bank. The banker says, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panie</span></span> Podvysotsky, are you laying down the gold, or must we trust to your honor?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;To my honor, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8217;</span> says Podvysotsky. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;So much the better.&#8217;</span> The banker throws the dice. Podvysotsky wins. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Take it, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8217;</span> says the banker, and pulling out the drawer he gives him a million. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Take it, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>, this is your gain.&#8217;</span> There was a million in the bank. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I didn't know that,&#8217;</span> says Podvysotsky. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panie</span></span> Podvysotsky,&#8217;</span> said the banker, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;you pledged your honor and we pledged ours.&#8217;</span> Podvysotsky took the million.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's not true,&#8221;</span> said Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panie</span></span> Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesn't say such things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As if a Polish gambler would give away a million!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, but checked himself at once. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Forgive me, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>, it's my fault again, he would, he would give away a million, for honor, for Polish honor. You see how I talk Polish, ha ha! Here, I stake ten roubles, the knave leads.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the pretty little <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panienotchka</span></span>, he he!&#8221;</span> laughed Maximov, pulling out his queen, and, as though trying to conceal it from every one, he moved right up and crossed himself hurriedly under the table. Mitya won. The rouble won, too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A corner!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg480"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll bet another rouble, a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;single&#8217;</span> stake,&#8221;</span> Maximov muttered gleefully, hugely delighted at having won a rouble.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Lost!&#8221;</span> shouted Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;double&#8217;</span> on the seven!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The seven too was trumped.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stop!&#8221;</span> cried Kalganov suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Double! Double!&#8221;</span> Mitya doubled his stakes, and each time he doubled the stake, the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles. The rouble stakes kept winning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;On the double!&#8221;</span> shouted Mitya furiously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've lost two hundred, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>. Will you stake another hundred?&#8221;</span> the Pole on the sofa inquired.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What? Lost two hundred already? Then another two hundred! All doubles!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And pulling his money out of his pocket, Mitya was about to fling two hundred roubles on the queen, but Kalganov covered it with his hand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's enough!&#8221;</span> he shouted in his ringing voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's the matter?&#8221;</span> Mitya stared at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's enough! I don't want you to play any more. Don't!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Because I don't. Hang it, come away. That's why. I won't let you go on playing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya gazed at him in astonishment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give it up, Mitya. He may be right. You've lost a lot as it is,&#8221;</span> said Grushenka, with a curious note in her voice. Both the Poles rose from their seats with a deeply offended air.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you joking, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>?&#8221;</span> said the short man, looking severely at Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How dare you!&#8221;</span> Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't dare to shout like that,&#8221;</span> cried Grushenka. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, you turkey-cocks!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya looked at each of them in turn. But something in Grushenka's face suddenly struck him, and at the same instant something new flashed into his mind&#8212;a strange new thought!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Pani</span></span> Agrippina,&#8221;</span> the little Pole was beginning, crimson with anger, when Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Most illustrious, two words with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg481"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the next room, I've two words to say to you, something pleasant, very pleasant. You'll be glad to hear it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The little <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pan</span></span> was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya. He agreed at once, however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too. I must have him!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;March, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie</span></span>!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</span> asked Grushenka, anxiously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We'll be back in one moment,&#8221;</span> answered Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in his eyes. His face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He led the Poles, not into the large room where the chorus of girls was assembling and the table was being laid, but into the bedroom on the right, where the trunks and packages were kept, and there were two large beds, with pyramids of cotton pillows on each. There was a lighted candle on a small deal table in the corner. The small man and Mitya sat down to this table, facing each other, while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside them, his hands behind his back. The Poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What can I do for you, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>?&#8221;</span> lisped the little Pole.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, look here, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>, I won't keep you long. There's money for you,&#8221;</span> he pulled out his notes. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Would you like three thousand? Take it and go your way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Three thousand, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>?&#8221;</span> He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Three, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panovie</span></span>, three! Listen, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>, I see you're a sensible man. Take three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with you&#8212;d'you hear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever. You understand that, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>, for ever. Here's the door, you go out of it. What have you got there, a great-coat, a fur coat? I'll bring it out to you. They'll get the horses out directly, and then&#8212;good-by, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya awaited an answer with assurance. He had no doubts. An expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole's face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And the money, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg482"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The money, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>? Five hundred roubles I'll give you this moment for the journey, and as a first installment, and two thousand five hundred to-morrow, in the town&#8212;I swear on my honor, I'll get it, I'll get it at any cost!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The Poles exchanged glances again. The short man's face looked more forbidding.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at once, this minute, cash down!&#8221;</span> Mitya added, feeling something wrong. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's the matter, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>? Don't you trust me? I can't give you the whole three thousand straight off. If I give it, you may come back to her to-morrow.... Besides, I haven't the three thousand with me. I've got it at home in the town,&#8221;</span> faltered Mitya, his spirit sinking at every word he uttered. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Upon my word, the money's there, hidden.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in the little man's face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What next?&#8221;</span> he asked ironically. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For shame!&#8221;</span> and he spat on the floor. Pan Vrublevsky spat too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You do that, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">panie</span></span>,&#8221;</span> said Mitya, recognizing with despair that all was over, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;because you hope to make more out of Grushenka? You're a couple of capons, that's what you are!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is a mortal insult!&#8221;</span> The little Pole turned as red as a crab, and he went out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear another word. Vrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed, confused and crestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pan</span></span> would at once raise an outcry. And so indeed he did. The Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Pani</span></span> Agrippina, I have received a mortal insult!&#8221;</span> he exclaimed. But Grushenka suddenly lost all patience, as though they had wounded her in the tenderest spot.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Speak Russian! Speak Russian!&#8221;</span> she cried, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;not another word of Polish! You used to talk Russian. You can't have forgotten it in five years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She was red with passion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Pani</span></span> Agrippina&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My name's Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I won't listen!&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg483"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The Pole gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously delivered himself in broken Russian:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Pani</span></span> Agrafena, I came here to forget the past and forgive it, to forget all that has happened till to-day&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Forgive? Came here to forgive me?&#8221;</span> Grushenka cut him short, jumping up from her seat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Just so, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pani</span></span>, I'm not pusillanimous, I'm magnanimous. But I was astounded when I saw your lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three thousand, in the other room to depart. I spat in the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pan's</span></span> face.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What? He offered you money for me?&#8221;</span> cried Grushenka, hysterically. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is it true, Mitya? How dare you? Am I for sale?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panie, panie!</span></span>&#8221;</span> yelled Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;she's pure and shining, and I have never been her lover! That's a lie....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How dare you defend me to him?&#8221;</span> shrieked Grushenka. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It wasn't virtue kept me pure, and it wasn't that I was afraid of Kuzma, but that I might hold up my head when I met him, and tell him he's a scoundrel. And he did actually refuse the money?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He took it! He took it!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;only he wanted to get the whole three thousand at once, and I could only give him seven hundred straight off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see: he heard I had money, and came here to marry me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Pani</span></span> Agrippina!&#8221;</span> cried the little Pole. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm&#8212;a knight, I'm&#8212;a nobleman, and not a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">lajdak</span></span>. I came here to make you my wife and I find you a different woman, perverse and shameless.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, go back where you came from! I'll tell them to turn you out and you'll be turned out,&#8221;</span> cried Grushenka, furious. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've been a fool, a fool, to have been miserable these five years! And it wasn't for his sake, it was my anger made me miserable. And this isn't he at all! Was he like this? It might be his father! Where did you get your wig from? He was a falcon, but this is a gander. He used to laugh and sing to me.... And I've been crying for five years, damned fool, abject, shameless I was!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands. At that instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left&#8212;a rollicking dance song.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A regular Sodom!&#8221;</span> Vrublevsky roared suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Landlord, send the shameless hussies away!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg484"></a> in at the door, hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarreling, at once entered the room.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you shouting for? D'you want to split your throat?&#8221;</span> he said, addressing Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Animal!&#8221;</span> bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Animal? And what sort of cards were you playing with just now? I gave you a pack and you hid it. You played with marked cards! I could send you to Siberia for playing with false cards, d'you know that, for it's just the same as false banknotes....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and the cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here's my pack unopened!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He held it up and showed it to all in the room. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From where I stood I saw him slip my pack away, and put his in place of it&#8212;you're a cheat and not a gentleman!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I twice saw the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pan</span></span> change a card!&#8221;</span> cried Kalganov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How shameful! How shameful!&#8221;</span> exclaimed Grushenka, clasping her hands, and blushing for genuine shame. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good Lord, he's come to that!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I thought so, too!&#8221;</span> said Mitya. But before he had uttered the words, Vrublevsky, with a confused and infuriated face, shook his fist at Grushenka, shouting:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You low harlot!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya flew at him at once, clutched him in both hands, lifted him in the air, and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right, from which they had just come.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've laid him on the floor, there,&#8221;</span> he announced, returning at once, gasping with excitement. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's struggling, the scoundrel! But he won't come back, no fear of that!...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He closed one half of the folding doors, and holding the other ajar called out to the little Pole:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Most illustrious, will you be pleased to retire as well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> said Trifon Borissovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;make them give you back the money you lost. It's as good as stolen from you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't want my fifty roubles back,&#8221;</span> Kalganov declared suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't want my two hundred, either,&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wouldn't take it for anything! Let him keep it as a consolation.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page485"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg485"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Bravo, Mitya! You're a trump, Mitya!&#8221;</span> cried Grushenka, and there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The little <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">pan</span></span>, crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity, was making for the door, but he stopped short and said suddenly, addressing Grushenka:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Pani</span></span>, if you want to come with me, come. If not, good-by.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door. This was a man of character: he had so good an opinion of himself that after all that had passed, he still expected that she would marry him. Mitya slammed the door after him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Lock it,&#8221;</span> said Kalganov. But the key clicked on the other side, they had locked it from within.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's capital!&#8221;</span> exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Serve them right!&#8221;</span></p>
