<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00089"><span class="c9">Chapter V. Not You, Not You!</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, it's only you,&#8221;</span> said Ivan dryly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, good-by! You are going to her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't advise you to; she's upset and you'll upset her more.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I have been with him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Has he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan Fyodorovitch, you must come back, you must. Do you hear?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was such a peremptory note in Katya's voice that Ivan, after a moment's hesitation, made up his mind to go back with Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She was listening,&#8221;</span> he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha heard it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on,&#8221;</span> said Ivan, going into the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page676"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg676"></a> drawing-room. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I won't sit down. I won't stay more than a minute.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> said Katerina Ivanovna, though she remained standing. She had changed very little during this time, but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered afterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What did he ask you to tell me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only one thing,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what&#8221;</span> (he was a little confused) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;... passed between you ... at the time of your first acquaintance ... in that town.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!&#8221;</span> She broke into a bitter laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, is he afraid for me or for himself? He asks me to spare&#8212;whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey Fyodorovitch!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Both yourself and him,&#8221;</span> he answered softly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221;</span> she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenly blushed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You don't know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> she said menacingly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I don't know myself yet. Perhaps you'll want to trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You will give your evidence honorably,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that's all that's wanted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Women are often dishonorable,&#8221;</span> she snarled. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only an hour ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a reptile ... but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he do it? Is he the murderer?&#8221;</span> she cried, all of a sudden, hysterically, turning quickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that he murdered his father. It's only you I believed!&#8221;</span> she continued, still addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started at her tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page677"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg677"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, that's enough, anyway,&#8221;</span> Ivan cut short the conversation. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am going. I'll come to-morrow.&#8221;</span> And turning at once, he walked out of the room and went straight downstairs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Follow him! Overtake him! Don't leave him alone for a minute!&#8221;</span> she said, in a hurried whisper. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's mad! Don't you know that he's mad? He is in a fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so. Go, run after him....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</span> He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was running after him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She told you to catch me up, because I'm mad. I know it all by heart,&#8221;</span> he added irritably.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their mind?&#8221;</span> Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I don't. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And can one observe that one's going mad oneself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I imagine one can't see oneself clearly in such circumstances,&#8221;</span> Alyosha answered with surprise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan paused for half a minute.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If you want to talk to me, please change the subject,&#8221;</span> he said suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha timidly, and he took Lise's note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan. They were just under a lamp-post. Ivan recognized the handwriting at once.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, from that little demon!&#8221;</span> he laughed maliciously, and, without opening the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The bits were scattered by the wind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,&#8221;</span> he said contemptuously, striding along the street again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do you mean, offering herself?&#8221;</span> exclaimed Alyosha.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page678"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg678"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How can you, Ivan, how can you?&#8221;</span> Alyosha cried warmly, in a grieved voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is ill; she is very ill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps.... I had hoped to hear something from you ... that would save her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You'll hear nothing from me. If she is a child I am not her nurse. Be quiet, Alexey. Don't go on about her. I am not even thinking about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They were silent again for a moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her how to act to-morrow at the trial,&#8221;</span> he said sharply and angrily again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. Whether she's to save Mitya or ruin him. She'll pray for light from above. She can't make up her mind for herself, you see. She has not had time to decide yet. She takes me for her nurse, too. She wants me to sing lullabies to her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha sadly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She is suffering. Why do you ... sometimes say things to her that give her hope?&#8221;</span> Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know that you've given her hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,&#8221;</span> he added.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I can't behave to her as I ought&#8212;break off altogether and tell her so straight out,&#8221;</span> said Ivan, irritably. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I must wait till sentence is passed on the murderer. If I break off with her now, she will avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the trial, for she hates him and knows she hates him. It's all a lie&#8212;lie upon lie! As long as I don't break off with her, she goes on hoping, and she won't ruin that monster, knowing how I want to get him out of trouble. If only that damned verdict would come!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The words <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;murderer&#8221;</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;monster&#8221;</span> echoed painfully in Alyosha's heart.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But how can she ruin Mitya?&#8221;</span> he asked, pondering on Ivan's words. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You don't know that yet. She's got a document in her hands, in Mitya's own writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder Fyodor Pavlovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page679"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg679"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's impossible!&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why is it impossible? I've read it myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There can't be such a document!&#8221;</span> Alyosha repeated warmly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There can't be, because he's not the murderer. It's not he murdered father, not he!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who is the murderer then, according to you?&#8221;</span> he asked, with apparent coldness. There was even a supercilious note in his voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know who,&#8221;</span> Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic, Smerdyakov?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know who,&#8221;</span> broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely breathe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who? Who?&#8221;</span> Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint suddenly vanished.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I only know one thing,&#8221;</span> Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">it wasn't you</span></em> killed father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Not you&#8217;</span>! What do you mean by <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;not you&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span> Ivan was thunderstruck.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was not you killed father, not you!&#8221;</span> Alyosha repeated firmly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The silence lasted for half a minute.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know I didn't. Are you raving?&#8221;</span> said Ivan, with a pale, distorted smile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing again under a lamp-post.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, Ivan. You've told yourself several times that you are the murderer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said so?&#8221;</span> Ivan faltered helplessly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've said so to yourself many times, when you've been alone during these two dreadful months,&#8221;</span> Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as before. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of himself, not of his own will, but obeying some irresistible command. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no one else. But you didn't do it: you are mistaken: you are not the murderer. Do you hear? It was not you! God has sent me to tell you so.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page680"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg680"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute. They were both standing still, gazing into each other's eyes. They were both pale. Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and clutched Alyosha's shoulder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've been in my room!&#8221;</span> he whispered hoarsely. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've been there at night, when he came.... Confess ... have you seen him, have you seen him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Whom do you mean&#8212;Mitya?&#8221;</span> Alyosha asked, bewildered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not him, damn the monster!&#8221;</span> Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know that he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">he</span></em>! I don't know whom you are talking about,&#8221;</span> Alyosha faltered, beginning to be alarmed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, you do know ... or how could you&#8212;? It's impossible that you don't know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Suddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed to reflect. A strange grin contorted his lips.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother,&#8221;</span> Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have said this to you, because you'll believe my word, I know that. I tell you once and for all, it's not you. You hear, once for all! God has put it into my heart to say this to you, even though it may make you hate me from this hour.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> he said, with a cold smile, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I can't endure prophets and epileptics&#8212;messengers from God especially&#8212;and you know that only too well. I break off all relations with you from this moment and probably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this turning. It's the way to your lodgings, too. You'd better be particularly careful not to come to me to-day! Do you hear?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother,&#8221;</span> Alyosha called after him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;if anything happens to you to-day, turn to me before any one!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the cross roads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he turned and walked slowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings; neither of them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitch's empty house. Alyosha had a furnished room in the house of some working people. Ivan lived some distance from him. He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge attached <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page681"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg681"></a> to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow of an official. But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who went to bed at six o'clock every evening and got up at six in the morning. Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late, and very fond of being alone. He did everything for himself in the one room he lived in, and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his abode.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell, when he suddenly stopped. He felt that he was trembling all over with anger. Suddenly he let go of the bell, turned back with a curse, and walked with rapid steps in the opposite direction. He walked a mile and a half to a tiny, slanting, wooden house, almost a hut, where Marya Kondratyevna, the neighbor who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and to whom Smerdyakov had once sung his songs and played on the guitar, was now lodging. She had sold their little house, and was now living here with her mother. Smerdyakov, who was ill&#8212;almost dying&#8212;had been with them ever since Fyodor Pavlovitch's death. It was to him Ivan was going now, drawn by a sudden and irresistible prompting.</p>

<div class="tei tei-div c2">
<a id="toc179"></a> <a id="pdf180"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00090"><span class="c9">Chapter VI. The First Interview With Smerdyakov</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">This was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his return from Moscow. The first time he had seen him and talked to him was on the first day of his arrival, then he had visited him once more, a fortnight later. But his visits had ended with that second one, so that it was now over a month since he had seen him. And he had scarcely heard anything of him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan had only returned five days after his father's death, so that he was not present at the funeral, which took place the day before he came back. The cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing his Moscow address, had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him, and she, not knowing his address either, telegraphed to her sister and aunt, reckoning on Ivan's going to see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow. But he did not go to them till four days <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page682"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg682"></a> after his arrival. When he got the telegram, he had, of course, set off post-haste to our town. The first to meet him was Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition to the general opinion of the town, he refused to entertain a suspicion against Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer. Later on, after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and hearing the details of the charge and the arrest, he was still more surprised at Alyosha, and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherly feeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was very fond.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan's feeling to his brother Dmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes a compassion for him, and even that was mixed with great contempt, almost repugnance. Mitya's whole personality, even his appearance, was extremely unattractive to him. Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovna's love for his brother. Yet he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, and that interview, far from shaking Ivan's belief in his guilt, positively strengthened it. He found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya had been talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent. He used violent language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He talked principally about the three thousand roubles, which he said had been <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;stolen&#8221;</span> from him by his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The money was mine, it was my money,&#8221;</span> Mitya kept repeating. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Even if I had stolen it, I should have had the right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to turn a fact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent way. He hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any one else. Quite the contrary, he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him; he was continually firing up and abusing every one. He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory's evidence about the open door, and declared that it was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the devil that opened it.&#8221;</span> But he could not bring forward any coherent explanation of the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;everything was lawful,&#8221;</span> to suspect and question him. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page683"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg683"></a> Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time to see Smerdyakov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in the hospital.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the hospital, confidently asserted in reply to Ivan's persistent questions, that Smerdyakov's epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day of the catastrophe. They gave him to understand that the attack was an exceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring several times, so that the patient's life was positively in danger, and it was only now, after they had applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that the patient would survive. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Though it might well be,&#8221;</span> added Doctor Herzenstube, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period, if not permanently.&#8221;</span> On Ivan's asking impatiently whether that meant that he was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case, in the full sense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were perceptible. Ivan decided to find out for himself what those abnormalities were.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov was lying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward. There was only one other bed in the room, and in it lay a tradesman of the town, swollen with dropsy, who was obviously almost dying; he could be no hindrance to their conversation. Smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for the first instant seemed nervous. So at least Ivan fancied. But that was only momentary. For the rest of the time he was struck, on the contrary, by Smerdyakov's composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that he was very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming to move his tongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and sallower. Throughout the interview, which lasted twenty minutes, he kept complaining of headache and of pain in all his limbs. His thin emasculate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page684"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg684"></a> face seemed to have become so tiny; his hair was ruffled, and his crest of curls in front stood up in a thin tuft. But in the left eye, which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's always worth while speaking to a clever man.&#8221;</span> Ivan was reminded of that at once. He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with painful effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first to speak. He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can you talk to me?&#8221;</span> asked Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I won't tire you much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Certainly I can,&#8221;</span> mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Has your honor been back long?&#8221;</span> he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervous visitor.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I only arrived to-day.... To see the mess you are in here.&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov sighed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why do you sigh? You knew of it all along,&#8221;</span> Ivan blurted out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how could I tell it would turn out like that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What would turn out? Don't prevaricate! You've foretold you'd have a fit; on the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned the very spot.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you said so at the examination yet?&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov queried with composure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan felt suddenly angry.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I haven't yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a great deal to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let you play with me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you, as in God Almighty?&#8221;</span> said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only for a moment closing his eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the first place,&#8221;</span> began Ivan, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know that epileptic fits can't be told beforehand. I've inquired; don't try and take me in. You can't foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the day and the hour beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if you didn't sham a fit on purpose?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov drawled deliberately. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I fell from the garret just in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page685"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg685"></a> the same way a year ago. It's quite true you can't tell the day and hour of a fit beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you did foretell the day and the hour!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the doctors here. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham; it's no use my saying any more about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the cellar?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You don't seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going down to the cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened me most was losing you and being left without defense in all the world. So I went down into the cellar thinking, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Here, it'll come on directly, it'll strike me down directly, shall I fall?&#8217;</span> And it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying. All that and all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before, when I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer, and it's all been written down in the protocol. And the doctor here, Mr. Varvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it brought it on, the apprehension that I might fall. It was just then that the fit seized me. And so they've written it down, that it's just how it must have happened, simply from my fear.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">As he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though exhausted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then you have said all that in your evidence?&#8221;</span> said Ivan, somewhat taken aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole truth,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov pronounced firmly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, not to say every word.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page686"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg686"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I didn't tell them that either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was afraid you'd go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to get out of the way of trouble.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you, foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to spare myself even more. That's why I told you to get out of harm's way, that you might understand that there would be trouble in the house, and would remain at home to protect your father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You might have said it more directly, you blockhead!&#8221;</span> Ivan suddenly fired up.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my fear that made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away that money, for he considered it as good as his own; but who could tell that it would end in a murder like this? I thought that he would only carry off the three thousand that lay under the master's mattress in the envelope, and you see, he's murdered him. How could you guess it either, sir?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But if you say yourself that it couldn't be guessed, how could I have guessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!&#8221;</span> said Ivan, pondering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to Moscow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could I guess it from that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for a minute.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer, for Moscow's a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you are not far off, would not be so bold. And if anything had happened, you might have come to protect me, too, for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch's illness, and that I was afraid of having a fit. And when I explained those knocks to you, by means of which one could go in to the deceased, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me, I thought that you would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page687"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg687"></a> guess yourself that he would be sure to do something, and so wouldn't go to Tchermashnya even, but would stay.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He talks very coherently,&#8221;</span> thought Ivan, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;though he does mumble; what's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are cunning with me, damn you!&#8221;</span> he exclaimed, getting angry.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I thought at the time that you quite guessed,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov parried with the simplest air.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I'd guessed, I should have stayed,&#8221;</span> cried Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went away in such a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away and save yourself in your fright.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Forgive me, I thought you were like me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course, I ought to have guessed,&#8221;</span> Ivan said in agitation; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and I did guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying, you are lying again,&#8221;</span> he cried, suddenly recollecting. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you remember how you went up to the carriage and said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's always worth while speaking to a clever man&#8217;</span>? So you were glad I went away, since you praised me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into his face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I was pleased,&#8221;</span> he articulated rather breathlessly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;it was simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya. For it was nearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it was not by way of praise, but of reproach. You didn't understand it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What reproach?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father, and would not protect us, for I might have been taken up any time for stealing that three thousand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Damn you!&#8221;</span> Ivan swore again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, did you tell the prosecutor and the investigating lawyer about those knocks?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I told them everything just as it was.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan wondered inwardly again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I thought of anything then,&#8221;</span> he began again, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;it was solely of some wickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that he would steal&#8212;I did not believe that then.... But I was prepared <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page688"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg688"></a> for any wickedness from you. You told me yourself you could sham a fit. What did you say that for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a fit on purpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you. It was just foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open-hearted with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What else is left for him to do?&#8221;</span> said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And who will believe him with all the proofs against him? Grigory Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after that? But never mind him! He is trembling to save himself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection, added:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out that it is the work of my hands&#8212;I've heard that already. But as to my being clever at shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one, if I really had had such a design against your father? If I had been planning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is that likely? As if that could be, such a thing has never happened. No one hears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you were to tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might defend me completely by doing so, for who would be likely to be such a criminal, if he is so open-hearted beforehand? Any one can see that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well,&#8221;</span> and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck by Smerdyakov's last argument. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't suspect you at all, and I think it's absurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am grateful to you for setting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but I'll come again. Meanwhile, good-by. Get well. Is there anything you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me, and provides me anything I want, according to her kindness. Good people visit me every day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by. But I shan't say anything of your being able to sham a fit, and I don't advise you to, either,&#8221;</span> something made Ivan say suddenly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page689"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg689"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I quite understand. And if you don't speak of that, I shall say nothing of that conversation of ours at the gate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Then it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had gone a dozen steps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there was an insulting significance in Smerdyakov's last words. He was almost on the point of turning back, but it was only a passing impulse, and muttering, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</span> he went out of the hospital.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">His chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not Smerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though he might have been expected to feel the opposite. He did not want to analyze the reason for this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance at prying into his sensations. He felt as though he wanted to make haste to forget something. In the following days he became convinced of Mitya's guilt, as he got to know all the weight of evidence against him. There was evidence of people of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at Plotnikov's shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory's evidence as to the open door. Grigory's wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan's questions, declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was not three paces from our bed,&#8221;</span> and that although she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know how he spends his time now?&#8221;</span> he asked; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;learning lists of French words by heart. He has an exercise-book under his pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he he he!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;in all probability&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov was. Ivan always felt that Alyosha's opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page690"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg690"></a> now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan's, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I've related already, told him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am not keen on her,&#8221;</span> it was an absolute lie: he loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan's return to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her. She was continually tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted Mitya, and in moments of discord and violent anger (and they were numerous) she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to Alyosha <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;lies upon lies.&#8221;</span> There was, of course, much that was false in it, and that angered Ivan more than anything.... But of all this later.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov's existence, and yet, a fortnight after his first visit to him, he began to be haunted by the same strange thoughts as before. It's enough to say that he was continually asking himself, why was it that on that last night in Fyodor Pavlovitch's house he had crept out on to the stairs like a thief and listened to hear what his father was doing below? Why had he recalled that afterwards with repulsion? Why next morning, had he been suddenly so depressed on the journey? Why, as he reached Moscow, had he said to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am a scoundrel&#8221;</span>? <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page691"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg691"></a> And now he almost fancied that these tormenting thoughts would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna, so completely did they take possession of him again. It was just after fancying this, that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at once, and put a question to him:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father, and afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the right to desire&#8217;</span>?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired father's death or not?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I did think so,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha, softly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn't you fancy then that what I wished was just that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;one reptile should devour another&#8217;</span>; that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as possible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother's face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Speak!&#8221;</span> cried Ivan, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I want above everything to know what you thought then. I want the truth, the truth!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,&#8221;</span> whispered Alyosha, and he did not add one softening phrase.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thanks,&#8221;</span> snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on his way. From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him. Immediately after that meeting with him, Ivan had not gone home, but went straight to Smerdyakov again.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00091"><span class="c9">Chapter VII. The Second Visit To Smerdyakov</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">By that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital. Ivan knew his new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house, divided in two by a passage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page692"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg692"></a> and her mother, and on the other, Smerdyakov. No one knew on what terms he lived with them, whether as a friend or as a lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he had come to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna's betrothed, and was living there for a time without paying for board or lodging. Both mother and daughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatly superior to themselves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into the passage. By Marya Kondratyevna's directions he went straight to the better room on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was a tiled stove in the room and it was extremely hot. The walls were gay with blue paper, which was a good deal used however, and in the cracks under it cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers, so that there was a continual rustling from them. The furniture was very scanty: two benches against each wall and two chairs by the table. The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with pink patterns on it. There was a pot of geranium on each of the two little windows. In the corner there was a case of ikons. On the table stood a little copper samovar with many dents in it, and a tray with two cups. But Smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out. He was sitting at the table on a bench. He was looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing with a pen. There was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick, but with a composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov's face that he had completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher, fuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down at the sides. He was sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown, rather dirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles on his nose, which Ivan had never seen him wearing before. This trifling circumstance suddenly redoubled Ivan's anger: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A creature like that and wearing spectacles!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his visitor through his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and rose from the bench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily, doing the least possible required by common civility. All this struck Ivan instantly; he took it all in and noted it at once&#8212;most of all the look in Smerdyakov's eyes, positively malicious, churlish and haughty. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you want to intrude for?&#8221;</span> it seemed to say; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page693"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg693"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;we settled everything then; why have you come again?&#8221;</span> Ivan could scarcely control himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's hot here,&#8221;</span> he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his overcoat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Take off your coat,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov conceded.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands. He took a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down. Smerdyakov managed to sit down on his bench before him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To begin with, are we alone?&#8221;</span> Ivan asked sternly and impulsively. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can they overhear us in there?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No one can hear anything. You've seen for yourself: there's a passage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was leaving the hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of shamming fits, you wouldn't tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation at the gate? What do you mean by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">all</span></em>? What could you mean by it? Were you threatening me? Have I entered into some sort of compact with you? Do you suppose I am afraid of you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with obvious intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to show his cards. Smerdyakov's eyes gleamed resentfully, his left eye winked, and he at once gave his answer, with his habitual composure and deliberation. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You want to have everything above-board; very well, you shall have it,&#8221;</span> he seemed to say.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you, knowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him to his fate, and that people mightn't after that conclude any evil about your feelings and perhaps of something else, too&#8212;that's what I promised not to tell the authorities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself, yet there was something in his voice, determined and emphatic, resentful and insolently defiant. He stared impudently at Ivan. A mist passed before Ivan's eyes for the first moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How? What? Are you out of your mind?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you suppose I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">knew</span></em> of the murder?&#8221;</span> Ivan cried at last, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page694"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg694"></a> he brought his fist violently on the table. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean by <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;something else, too&#8217;</span>? Speak, scoundrel!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent stare.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;something else, too&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;something else&#8217;</span> I meant was that you probably, too, were very desirous of your parent's death.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder, so that he fell back against the wall. In an instant his face was bathed in tears. Saying, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,&#8221;</span> he dried his eyes with a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping. A minute passed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's enough! Leave off,&#8221;</span> Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't put me out of all patience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his puckered face reflected the insult he had just received.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri I meant to kill my father?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I didn't know what thoughts were in your mind then,&#8221;</span> said Smerdyakov resentfully; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on that very point.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To sound what, what?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father to be murdered or not.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive, insolent tone to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was you murdered him?&#8221;</span> he cried suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn't I murdered him. And I should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of it again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such a position, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I resolved to sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother, then the business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Look here, you didn't say that a fortnight ago.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page695"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg695"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I thought you'd understand without wasting words, and that being such a sensible man you wouldn't care to talk of it openly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ... what could I have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As for the murder, you couldn't have done that and didn't want to, but as for wanting some one else to do it, that was just what you did want.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have wanted it; what grounds had I for wanting it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?&#8221;</span> said Smerdyakov sarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, after your parent's death there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you, and very likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that lady, Agrafena Alexandrovna, she would have had all his capital made over to her directly after the wedding, for she's plenty of sense, so that your parent would not have left you two roubles between the three of you. And were they far from a wedding, either? Not a hair's-breadth: that lady had only to lift her little finger and he would have run after her to church, with his tongue out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan restrained himself with painful effort.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very good,&#8221;</span> he commented at last. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, I haven't jumped up, I haven't knocked you down, I haven't killed you. Speak on. So, according to you, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning on him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then he would lose all the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property, and would go off to exile; so his share of the inheritance would come to you and your brother Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so you'd each have not forty, but sixty thousand each. There's not a doubt you did reckon on Dmitri Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had reckoned on any one then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri, and I swear I did expect some wickedness from you ... at the time.... I remember my impression!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page696"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg696"></a> on me as well,&#8221;</span> said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So that it was just by that more than anything you showed me what was in your mind. For if you had a foreboding about me and yet went away, you as good as said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You can murder my parent, I won't hinder you!&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You scoundrel! So that's how you understood it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were meaning to go to Moscow and refused all your father's entreaties to go to Tchermashnya&#8212;and simply at a foolish word from me you consented at once! What reason had you to consent to Tchermashnya? Since you went to Tchermashnya with no reason, simply at my word, it shows that you must have expected something from me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I swear I didn't!&#8221;</span> shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You didn't? Then you ought, as your father's son, to have had me taken to the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least, to have given me a punch in the face on the spot, but you were not a bit angry, if you please, and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish word and went away, which was utterly absurd, for you ought to have stayed to save your parent's life. How could I help drawing my conclusions?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I am sorry I didn't punch you in the face,&#8221;</span> he said with a bitter smile. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I couldn't have taken you to the lock-up just then. Who would have believed me and what charge could I bring against you? But the punch in the face ... oh, I'm sorry I didn't think of it. Though blows are forbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the ordinary occasions of life,&#8221;</span> he said in the same complacent and sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch's table, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;in the ordinary occasions of life, blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law, and people have given them up, but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows, not only among us but all over the world, be it even the fullest Republic of France, just as in the time of Adam and Eve, and they never will leave off, but you, even in an exceptional case, did not dare.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page697"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg697"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you learning French words for?&#8221;</span> Ivan nodded towards the exercise-book lying on the table.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why shouldn't I learn them so as to improve my education, supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, monster.&#8221;</span> Ivan's eyes flashed and he trembled all over. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am not afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like about me, and if I don't beat you to death, it's simply because I suspect you of that crime and I'll drag you to justice. I'll unmask you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To my thinking, you'd better keep quiet, for what can you accuse me of, considering my absolute innocence? and who would believe you? Only if you begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I must defend myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you think I am afraid of you now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If the court doesn't believe all I've said to you just now, the public will, and you will be ashamed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's as much as to say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's always worth while speaking to a sensible man,&#8217;</span> eh?&#8221;</span> snarled Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You hit the mark, indeed. And you'd better be sensible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat, and without replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at him, walked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air refreshed him. There was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare of ideas and sensations filled his soul. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Shall I go at once and give information against Smerdyakov? But what information can I give? He is not guilty, anyway. On the contrary, he'll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off for Tchermashnya then? What for? What for?&#8221;</span> Ivan asked himself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, of course, I was expecting something and he is right....&#8221;</span> And he remembered for the hundredth time how, on the last night in his father's house, he had listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I expected it then, that's true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder! Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don't dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page698"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg698"></a> and alarmed her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated all his conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He couldn't be calmed, however much she tried to soothe him: he kept walking about the room, speaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last he sat down, put his elbows on the table, leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strange sentence: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If it's not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov who's the murderer, I share his guilt, for I put him up to it. Whether I did, I don't know yet. But if he is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat without a word, went to her writing-table, opened a box standing on it, took out a sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the document of which Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;conclusive proof&#8221;</span> that Dmitri had killed his father. It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna when he was drunk, on the very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on the way to the monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna's, when Grushenka had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed to Grushenka. I don't know whether he saw her, but in the evening he was at the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Metropolis,&#8221;</span> where he got thoroughly drunk. Then he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself. It was a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. It was like the talk of a drunken man, who, on his return home, begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has just been insulted, what a rascal had just insulted him, what a fine fellow he is on the other hand, and how he will pay that scoundrel out; and all that at great length, with great excitement and incoherence, with drunken tears and blows on the table. The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was evidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest. The letter ran as follows:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<p class="tei tei-p c29"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c30">Fatal Katya</span></span><span class="c20">: To-morrow I will get the money and repay your three thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my love! Let us make an end! To-morrow I shall try and get it from every one, and if I can't borrow it, I give you my word of</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page699"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg699"></a><span class="c20">honor I shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money from under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone. If I have to go to Siberia for it, I'll give you back your three thousand. And farewell. I bow down to the ground before you, for I've been a scoundrel to you. Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, you'll be happier and so shall I! Better Siberia than your love, for I love another woman and you got to know her too well to-day, so how can you forgive? I will murder the man who's robbed me! I'll leave you all and go to the East so as to see no one again. Not</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c31">her</span></em> <span class="c20">either, for you are not my only tormentress; she is too. Farewell!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c29"><span class="c20">P.S.&#8212;I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my heart. One string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two! I shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear three thousand from him and fling it to you. Though I've been a scoundrel to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand. The cur keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a thief, but I'll murder my thief. Katya, don't look disdainful. Dmitri is not a thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his father and ruined himself to hold his ground, rather than endure your pride. And he doesn't love you.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c29"><span class="c20">P.P.S.&#8212;I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.&#8212;Katya, pray to God that some one'll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped in gore, and if no one does&#8212;I shall! Kill me!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c29"><span class="c20">Your slave and enemy,</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c29"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c30">D. Karamazov.</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When Ivan read this <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;document&#8221;</span> he was convinced. So then it was his brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. This letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There could be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya's guilt. The suspicion never occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not fit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he only thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him. So passed a month. He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page700"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg700"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He'll end in madness,&#8221;</span> the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him, and Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that month Ivan himself began to feel very ill. He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And just at that time his relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were like two enemies in love with one another. Katerina Ivanovna's <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;returns&#8221;</span> to Mitya, that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene described above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan had never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of Mitya's guilt, in spite of those <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;returns&#8221;</span> that were so hateful to him. It is remarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more and more every day, he realized that it was not on account of Katya's <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;returns&#8221;</span> that he hated him, but just <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">because he was the murderer of his father</span></em>. He was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed to him a plan of escape&#8212;a plan he had obviously thought over a long time. He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov's, that it was to his, Ivan's, advantage that his brother should be convicted, as that would increase his inheritance and Alyosha's from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya's escape. On his return from seeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel that he was anxious for Mitya's escape, not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is it because I am as much a murderer at heart?&#8221;</span> he asked himself. Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above all suffered cruelly all that month. But of that later....</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha's presence: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was you, you, persuaded me of his&#8221;</span> (that is, Mitya's) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;guilt!&#8221;</span> Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page701"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg701"></a> the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in her presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">she</span></em>, she, who had produced that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;document&#8221;</span> and proved his brother's guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've been at Smerdyakov's myself!&#8221;</span> When had she been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all so sure of Mitya's guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He could not understand how he could, half an hour before, have let those words pass and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell and rushed off to Smerdyakov. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall kill him, perhaps, this time,&#8221;</span> he thought on the way.</p>
