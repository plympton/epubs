<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had left her last greetings, bidding him remember the hour of her love for ever, knew nothing of what had happened to her, and was at that moment in a condition of feverish agitation and activity. For the last two days he had been in such an inconceivable state of mind that he might easily have fallen ill with brain fever, as he said himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been able to find him the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting him at the tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by his orders, concealed his movements.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself,&#8221;</span> as he expressed it himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a dash out of the town on urgent business, terrible as it was to him to lose sight of Grushenka for a moment. All this was explained afterwards in detail, and confirmed by documentary evidence; but for the present we will only note the most essential incidents of those two terrible days immediately preceding the awful catastrophe, that broke so suddenly upon him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Though Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour, genuinely and sincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and mercilessly. The worst of it was that he could never tell what she meant to do. To prevail upon her by force or kindness was also impossible: she would yield to nothing. She would only have become angry and turned away from him altogether, he knew that well already. He suspected, quite correctly, that she, too, was passing through an inward struggle, and was in a state of extraordinary <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg406"></a> indecision, that she was making up her mind to something, and unable to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate him and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka's uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of the approaching return of the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;officer,&#8221;</span> that is, of the man who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka's life, and whose arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached hardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was. Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time. He simply did not believe in a suitor who suddenly turned up again after five years' disappearance, still less in his speedy arrival. Moreover, in the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;officer's&#8221;</span> first letter which had been shown to Mitya, the possibility of his new rival's visit was very vaguely suggested. The letter was very indefinite, high-flown, and full of sentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the last lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to more definitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered afterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from Siberia on Grushenka's face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg407"></a> later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely forgotten the officer's existence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take, his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and must be decided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was expecting every moment Grushenka's decision, always believing that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of the moment. All of a sudden she would say to him: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Take me, I'm yours for ever,&#8221;</span> and it would all be over. He would seize her and bear her away at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear her away at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia, if not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle down with her incognito, so that no one would know anything about them, there, here, or anywhere. Then, oh, then, a new life would begin at once!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Of this different, reformed and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;virtuous&#8221;</span> life (<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;it must, it must be virtuous&#8221;</span>) he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He thirsted for that reformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in which he had sunk of his own free will, was too revolting to him, and, like very many men in such cases, he put faith above all in change of place. If only it were not for these people, if only it were not for these circumstances, if only he could fly away from this accursed place&#8212;he would be altogether regenerated, would enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and what he was yearning for.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But all this could only be on condition of the first, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">happy</span></em> solution of the question. There was another possibility, a different and awful ending. Suddenly she might say to him: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Go away. I have just come to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to marry him and don't want you&#8221;</span>&#8212;and then ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to the last hour he didn't know. That must be said to his credit. He had no definite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching and spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy solution of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But for that ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">If she were to say to him: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm yours; take me away,&#8221;</span> how could <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg408"></a> he take her away? Where had he the means, the money to do it? It was just at this time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles which had gone on without interruption for so many years, ceased. Grushenka had money, of course, but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride; he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life with her himself, at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceive of taking her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of intense repulsion. I won't enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confine myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had dishonestly appropriated. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've been a scoundrel to one of them, and I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly,&#8221;</span> was his feeling then, as he explained after: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and when Grushenka knows, she won't care for such a scoundrel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Where then was he to get the means, where was he to get the fateful money? Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and only because I hadn't the money. Oh, the shame of it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the money, knew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no more of this here, as it will all be clear later. But his chief trouble, I must explain however obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">have the right</span></em> to take it, he must first restore Katerina Ivanovna's three thousand&#8212;if not, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm a common pickpocket, I'm a scoundrel, and I don't want to begin a new life as a scoundrel,&#8221;</span> Mitya decided. And so he made up his mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three thousand, and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">first of all</span></em>. The final stage of this decision, so to say, had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his last interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high-road, on the evening when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing Alyosha's account of it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told him to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her. After parting from his brother on that night, he had felt in his frenzy that it would be better <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;to murder and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to Katya. I'd rather every one thought me a robber and a murderer, I'd rather go to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg409"></a> Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceived her and stole her money, and used her money to run away with Grushenka and begin a new life! That I can't do!&#8221;</span> So Mitya decided, grinding his teeth, and he might well fancy at times that his brain would give way. But meanwhile he went on struggling....</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing left for him but despair&#8212;for what chance had he, with nothing in the world, to raise such a sum?&#8212;yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he would get that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him of itself, as though it might drop from heaven. That is just how it is with people who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money, except to squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort of their own, and have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl of the most fantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately after he had parted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his thoughts into a tangle of confusion. This is how it was he pitched first on a perfectly wild enterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind in such circumstances the most impossible, fantastic schemes occur first, and seem most practical.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who was Grushenka's protector, and to propose a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;scheme&#8221;</span> to him, and by means of it to obtain from him at once the whole of the sum required. Of the commercial value of his scheme he had no doubt, not the slightest, and was only uncertain how Samsonov would look upon his freak, supposing he were to consider it from any but the commercial point of view. Though Mitya knew the merchant by sight, he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him. But for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction that the old reprobate, who was lying at death's door, would perhaps not at all object now to Grushenka's securing a respectable position, and marrying a man <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;to be depended upon.&#8221;</span> And he believed not only that he would not object, but that this was what he desired, and, if opportunity arose, that he would be ready to help. From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka's, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg410"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka's past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka's, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non-existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya's part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple-hearted man. It was an instance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded that, being on the eve of his departure for the next world, old Kuzma must sincerely repent of his past relations with Grushenka, and that she had no more devoted friend and protector in the world than this, now harmless old man.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">After his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he hardly slept all night, and at ten o'clock next morning, he was at the house of Samsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It was a very large and gloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and outhouses. In the lower story lived Samsonov's two married sons with their families, his old sister, and his unmarried daughter. In the lodge lived two of his clerks, one of whom also had a large family. Both the lodge and the lower story were overcrowded, but the old man kept the upper floor to himself, and would not even let the daughter live there with him, though she waited upon him, and in spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours, and at any time he might call her, to run upstairs to him from below.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">This upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg411"></a> for show, furnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long monotonous rows of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with glass chandeliers under shades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls. All these rooms were entirely empty and unused, for the old man kept to one room, a small, remote bedroom, where he was waited upon by an old servant with a kerchief on her head, and by a lad, who used to sit on the locker in the passage. Owing to his swollen legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was only rarely lifted from his leather arm-chair, when the old woman supporting him led him up and down the room once or twice. He was morose and taciturn even with this old woman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When he was informed of the arrival of the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;captain,&#8221;</span> he at once refused to see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again. Samsonov questioned the lad minutely: What he looked like? Whether he was drunk? Was he going to make a row? The answer he received was: that he was sober, but wouldn't go away. The old man again refused to see him. Then Mitya, who had foreseen this, and purposely brought pencil and paper with him, wrote clearly on the piece of paper the words: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;On most important business closely concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,&#8221;</span> and sent it up to the old man.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to the drawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to his younger son to come upstairs to him at once. This younger son, a man over six foot and of exceptional physical strength, who was closely-shaven and dressed in the European style, though his father still wore a kaftan and a beard, came at once without a comment. All the family trembled before the father. The old man had sent for this giant, not because he was afraid of the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;captain&#8221;</span> (he was by no means of a timorous temper), but in order to have a witness in case of any emergency. Supported by his son and the servant-lad, he waddled at last into the drawing-room. It may be assumed that he felt considerable curiosity. The drawing-room in which Mitya was awaiting him was a vast, dreary room that laid a weight of depression on the heart. It had a double row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and three immense chandeliers with glass lusters covered with shades.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his fate with nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg412"></a> opposite door, seventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with his long, military stride walked to meet him. Mitya was well dressed, in a frock-coat, buttoned up, with a round hat and black gloves in his hands, just as he had been three days before at the elder's, at the family meeting with his father and brothers. The old man waited for him, standing dignified and unbending, and Mitya felt at once that he had looked him through and through as he advanced. Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov's immensely swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been thick, hung down now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest in dignified silence, motioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and, leaning on his son's arm he began lowering himself on to the sofa opposite, groaning painfully, so that Mitya, seeing his painful exertions, immediately felt remorseful and sensitively conscious of his insignificance in the presence of the dignified person he had ventured to disturb.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it you want of me, sir?&#8221;</span> said the old man, deliberately, distinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last seated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at once speaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positive frenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on the brink of ruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he failed. Old Samsonov probably grasped all this in an instant, though his face remained cold and immovable as a statue's.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard more than once of my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, who robbed me of my inheritance from my mother ... seeing the whole town is gossiping about it ... for here every one's gossiping of what they shouldn't ... and besides, it might have reached you through Grushenka ... I beg your pardon, through Agrafena Alexandrovna ... Agrafena Alexandrovna, the lady for whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will not reproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize the gist of it. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention (Mitya purposely used these words instead of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;intentionally&#8221;</span>) consulted a lawyer in the chief town of the province, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;a distinguished lawyer, Kuzma Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg413"></a> You have perhaps heard of him? A man of vast intellect, the mind of a statesman ... he knows you, too ... spoke of you in the highest terms ...&#8221;</span> Mitya broke down again. But these breaks did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggled on and on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">This Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting the documents he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat vaguely to these documents, and slurred over the subject with special haste), reported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning the village of Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to have come to him, Mitya, from his mother, and so checkmate the old villain, his father ... <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;because every door was not closed and justice might still find a loophole.&#8221;</span> In fact, he might reckon on an additional sum of six or even seven thousand roubles from Fyodor Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least, twenty-five thousand, he might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;thirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didn't get seventeen from that heartless man!&#8221;</span> So he, Mitya, had thrown the business up, for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on coming here was struck dumb by a cross-claim made upon him (here Mitya went adrift again and again took a flying leap forward), <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;so will not you, excellent and honored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take up all my claims against that unnatural monster, and pay me a sum down of only three thousand?... You see, you cannot, in any case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swear that. Quite the contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of three.&#8221;</span> Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll do the business with you at a notary's, or whatever it is ... in fact, I'm ready to do anything.... I'll hand over all the deeds ... whatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw up the agreement at once ... and if it were possible, if it were only possible, that very morning.... You could pay me that three thousand, for there isn't a capitalist in this town to compare with you, and so would save me from ... would save me, in fact ... for a good, I might say an honorable action.... For I cherish the most honorable feelings for a certain person, whom you know well, and care for as a father. I would not have come, indeed, if it had not been as a father. And, indeed, it's a struggle of three in this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg414"></a> business, for it's fate&#8212;that's a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch! A tragedy, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as you've dropped out long ago, it's a tug-of-war between two. I'm expressing it awkwardly, perhaps, but I'm not a literary man. You see, I'm on the one side, and that monster on the other. So you must choose. It's either I or the monster. It all lies in your hands&#8212;the fate of three lives, and the happiness of two.... Excuse me, I'm making a mess of it, but you understand ... I see from your venerable eyes that you understand ... and if you don't understand, I'm done for ... so you see!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;so you see!&#8221;</span> and jumping up from his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish proposal. At the last phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all fallen flat, above all, that he had been talking utter nonsense.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and now it's nothing but nonsense.&#8221;</span> The idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind. All the while he had been talking, the old man sat motionless, watching him with an icy expression in his eyes. After keeping him for a moment in suspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive and chilling tone:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Excuse me, we don't undertake such business.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?&#8221;</span> he muttered, with a pale smile. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I suppose it's all up with me&#8212;what do you think?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Excuse me....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed a movement in the old man's face. He started.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, sir, business of that sort's not in our line,&#8221;</span> said the old man slowly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's the court, and the lawyers&#8212;it's a perfect misery. But if you like, there is a man here you might apply to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good heavens! Who is it? You're my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,&#8221;</span> faltered Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He doesn't live here, and he's not here just now. He is a peasant, he does business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He's been haggling with Fyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse at Tchermashnya. They can't agree on the price, maybe you've heard? Now he's come back again and is staying with the priest at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg415"></a> Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the Volovya station. He wrote to me, too, about the business of the copse, asking my advice. Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So if you were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy the offer you've made me, he might possibly&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A brilliant idea!&#8221;</span> Mitya interrupted ecstatically. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's the very man, it would just suit him. He's haggling with him for it, being asked too much, and here he would have all the documents entitling him to the property itself. Ha ha ha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh, startling Samsonov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?&#8221;</span> cried Mitya effusively.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't mention it,&#8221;</span> said Samsonov, inclining his head.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you don't know, you've saved me. Oh, it was a true presentiment brought me to you.... So now to this priest!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No need of thanks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll make haste and fly there. I'm afraid I've overtaxed your strength. I shall never forget it. It's a Russian says that, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a R-r-russian!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be sure!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a malignant gleam in the old man's eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but at once blamed himself for his mistrustfulness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's because he's tired,&#8221;</span> he thought.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand that it's for her,&#8221;</span> he cried, his voice ringing through the room. He bowed, turned sharply round, and with the same long stride walked to the door without looking back. He was trembling with delight.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved me,&#8221;</span> was the thought in his mind. And if such a business man as Samsonov (a most worthy old man, and what dignity!) had suggested this course, then ... then success was assured. He would fly off immediately. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will be back before night, I shall be back at night and the thing is done. Could the old man have been laughing at me?&#8221;</span> exclaimed Mitya, as he strode towards his lodging. He could, of course, imagine nothing, but that the advice was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg416"></a> practical <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;from such a business man&#8221;</span> with an understanding of the business, with an understanding of this Lyagavy (curious surname!). Or&#8212;the old man was laughing at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long afterwards, when the catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself confessed, laughing, that he had made a fool of the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;captain.&#8221;</span> He was a cold, spiteful and sarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies. Whether it was the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;captain's&#8221;</span> excited face, or the foolish conviction of the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;rake and spendthrift,&#8221;</span> that he, Samsonov, could be taken in by such a cock-and-bull story as his scheme, or his jealousy of Grushenka, in whose name this <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;scapegrace&#8221;</span> had rushed in on him with such a tale to get money which worked on the old man, I can't tell. But at the instant when Mitya stood before him, feeling his legs grow weak under him, and frantically exclaiming that he was ruined, at that moment the old man looked at him with intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him. When Mitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to his son and bade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again, and never admitted even into the yard, or else he'd&#8212;</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw him enraged, trembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the old man was shaking with anger, and by evening he was worse, and sent for the doctor.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00058"><span class="c9">Chapter II. Lyagavy</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for horses. He had forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was left after so many years of prosperity! But he had at home an old silver watch which had long ceased to go. He snatched it up and carried it to a Jewish watchmaker who had a shop in the market-place. The Jew gave him six roubles for it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I didn't expect that,&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was still in a state of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran home. At home he borrowed three roubles from the people of the house, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg417"></a> who loved him so much that they were pleased to give it him, though it was all they had. Mitya in his excitement told them on the spot that his fate would be decided that day, and he described, in desperate haste, the whole scheme he had put before Samsonov, the latter's decision, his own hopes for the future, and so on. These people had been told many of their lodger's secrets before, and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud, and almost one of themselves. Having thus collected nine roubles Mitya sent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station. This was how the fact came to be remembered and established that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;at midday, on the day before the event, Mitya had not a farthing, and that he had sold his watch to get money and had borrowed three roubles from his landlord, all in the presence of witnesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Though he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would at last solve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya station, he trembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in his absence. What if she made up her mind to-day to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch? This was why he had gone off without telling her and why he left orders with his landlady not to let out where he had gone, if any one came to inquire for him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I must, I must get back to-night,&#8221;</span> he repeated, as he was jolted along in the cart, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy back here ... to draw up the deed.&#8221;</span> So mused Mitya, with a throbbing heart, but alas! his dreams were not fated to be carried out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">To begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya station which turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve. Secondly, he did not find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had gone off to a neighboring village. While Mitya, setting off there with the same exhausted horses, was looking for him, it was almost dark.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him at once that though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he was now at Suhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the forester's cottage, as he was buying timber there too. At Mitya's urgent request that he would take him to Lyagavy at once, and by so doing <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;save him, so to speak,&#8221;</span> the priest agreed, after some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg418"></a> demur, to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok; his curiosity was obviously aroused. But, unluckily, he advised their going on foot, as it would not be <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;much over&#8221;</span> a verst. Mitya, of course, agreed, and marched off with his yard-long strides, so that the poor priest almost ran after him. He was a very cautious man, though not old.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously and excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all the way. The priest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He turned off Mitya's questions with: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know. Ah, I can't say. How can I tell?&#8221;</span> and so on. When Mitya began to speak of his quarrel with his father over his inheritance, the priest was positively alarmed, as he was in some way dependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch. He inquired, however, with surprise, why he called the peasant-trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained to Mitya that, though the man's name really was Lyagavy, he was never called so, as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that he must be sure to call him Gorstkin, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;or you'll do nothing with him; he won't even listen to you,&#8221;</span> said the priest in conclusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that that was what Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the priest dropped the subject, though he would have done well to put into words his doubt whether, if Samsonov had sent him to that peasant, calling him Lyagavy, there was not something wrong about it and he was turning him into ridicule. But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles. He hurried, striding along, and only when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realize that they had come not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three. This annoyed him, but he controlled himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the hut, and Gorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the other side of the passage. They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle. The hut was extremely overheated. On the table there was a samovar that had gone out, a tray with cups, an empty rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and some half-eaten crusts of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretched at full length on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for a pillow, snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course I must wake him. My business is too important. I've <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg419"></a> come in such haste. I'm in a hurry to get back to-day,&#8221;</span> he said in great agitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not giving their opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake him himself; he tried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's drunk,&#8221;</span> Mitya decided. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good Lord! What am I to do? What am I to do?&#8221;</span> And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him by the arms, by the legs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making him sit on the bench. Yet, after prolonged exertions, he could only succeed in getting the drunken man to utter absurd grunts, and violent, but inarticulate oaths.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, you'd better wait a little,&#8221;</span> the priest pronounced at last, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for he's obviously not in a fit state.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's been drinking the whole day,&#8221;</span> the forester chimed in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If only you knew how important it is to me and how desperate I am!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, you'd better wait till morning,&#8221;</span> the priest repeated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Till morning? Mercy! that's impossible!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping man again, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of his efforts. The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,&#8221;</span> said Mitya, in complete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his face. The priest seized the moment to put before him, very reasonably, that, even if he succeeded in wakening the man, he would still be drunk and incapable of conversation. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And your business is important,&#8221;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;so you'd certainly better put it off till morning.&#8221;</span> With a gesture of despair Mitya agreed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable moment. As soon as he wakes I'll begin. I'll pay you for the light,&#8221;</span> he said to the forester, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for the night's lodging, too; you'll remember Dmitri Karamazov. Only, Father, I don't know what we're to do with you. Where will you sleep?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I'm going home. I'll take his horse and get home,&#8221;</span> he said, indicating the forester. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And now I'll say good-by. I wish you all success.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So it was settled. The priest rode off on the forester's horse, delighted to escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering whether he ought not next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg420"></a> Pavlovitch of this curious incident, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;or he may in an unlucky hour hear of it, be angry, and withdraw his favor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without a word, and Mitya sat on the bench to <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;catch the favorable moment,&#8221;</span> as he expressed it. Profound dejection clung about his soul like a heavy mist. A profound, intense dejection! He sat thinking, but could reach no conclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket chirped; it became insufferably close in the overheated room. He suddenly pictured the garden, the path behind the garden, the door of his father's house mysteriously opening and Grushenka running in. He leapt up from the bench.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's a tragedy!&#8221;</span> he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he went up to the sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean, middle-aged peasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long, thin, reddish beard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat, from the pocket of which peeped the chain of a silver watch. Mitya looked at his face with intense hatred, and for some unknown reason his curly hair particularly irritated him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">What was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things of such importance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly worn out, should with business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on whom his whole fate depended, while he snored as though there were nothing the matter, as though he'd dropped from another planet.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, the irony of fate!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, and, quite losing his head, he fell again to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him with a sort of ferocity, pulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but after five minutes of vain exertions, he returned to his bench in helpless despair, and sat down.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stupid! Stupid!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And how dishonorable it all is!&#8221;</span> something made him add. His head began to ache horribly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Should he fling it up and go away altogether?&#8221;</span> he wondered. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, wait till to-morrow now. I'll stay on purpose. What else did I come for? Besides, I've no means of going. How am I to get away from here now? Oh, the idiocy of it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to have slept for two hours or more. He was waked up by his head <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg421"></a> aching so unbearably that he could have screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of his head ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had happened to him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the forester's room. The forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya's surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange unconcern, though he did go to see to it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he's dead, he's dead! and ... what am I to do then?&#8221;</span> cried Mitya frantically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on Lyagavy's head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and when he opened the window said grumpily:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It'll be all right, now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya fussed about the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head, and gravely resolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out that when he sat down for a moment to take breath, he closed his eyes, unconsciously stretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about nine o'clock. The sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the hut. The curly-headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his coat on. He had another samovar and another bottle in front of him. Yesterday's bottle had already been finished, and the new one was more than half empty. Mitya jumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again, hopelessly and incurably. He stared at him for a moment with wide opened eyes. The peasant was silently and slyly watching him, with insulting composure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so Mitya fancied. He rushed up to him.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg422"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Excuse me, you see ... I ... you've most likely heard from the forester here in the hut. I'm Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son of the old Karamazov whose copse you are buying.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's a lie!&#8221;</span> said the peasant, calmly and confidently.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,&#8221;</span> said the peasant, speaking thickly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do wake up, and collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here. You wrote to Samsonov, and he has sent me to you,&#8221;</span> Mitya gasped breathlessly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're l-lying!&#8221;</span> Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya's legs went cold.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For mercy's sake! It isn't a joke! You're drunk, perhaps. Yet you can speak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're a painter!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For mercy's sake! I'm Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer to make you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerning the copse!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The peasant stroked his beard importantly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, you've contracted for the job and turned out a scamp. You're a scoundrel!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I assure you you're mistaken,&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, wringing his hands in despair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed up his eyes cunningly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery. D'you hear? You're a scoundrel! Do you understand that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;something seemed to hit him on the head,&#8221;</span> as he said afterwards. In an instant a light seemed to dawn in his mind, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;a light was kindled and I grasped it all.&#8221;</span> He stood, stupefied, wondering how he, after all a man of intelligence, could have yielded to such folly, have been led into such an adventure, and have kept it up for almost twenty-four hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, the man's drunk, dead drunk, and he'll go on drinking now for a week; what's the use of waiting here? And what if <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg423"></a> Samsonov sent me here on purpose? What if she&#8212;? Oh, God, what have I done?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya might have killed the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a child. He went quietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it on without a word, and went out of the hut. He did not find the forester in the next room; there was no one there. He took fifty kopecks in small change out of his pocket and put them on the table for his night's lodging, the candle, and the trouble he had given. Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all round. He walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the hut, to the right or to the left. Hurrying there the evening before with the priest, he had not noticed the road. He had no revengeful feeling for anybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He strode along a narrow forest path, aimless, dazed, without heeding where he was going. A child could have knocked him down, so weak was he in body and soul. He got out of the forest somehow, however, and a vista of fields, bare after the harvest, stretched as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What despair! What death all round!&#8221;</span> he repeated, striding on and on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven across country in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya asked the way, and it turned out that the old merchant, too, was going to Volovya. After some discussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours later they arrived. At Volovya, Mitya at once ordered posting-horses to drive to the town, and suddenly realized that he was appallingly hungry. While the horses were being harnessed, an omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in an instant, ate a huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three glasses of vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. He flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;unalterable&#8221;</span> plan to procure that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;accursed money&#8221;</span> before evening. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And to think, only to think that a man's life should be ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand!&#8221;</span> he cried, contemptuously. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll settle it to-day.&#8221;</span> And if it had not been for the thought of Grushenka and of what might have happened to her, which never left him, he would perhaps have become quite cheerful <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg424"></a> again.... But the thought of her was stabbing him to the heart every moment, like a sharp knife.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.</p>
