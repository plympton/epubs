<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima woke up feeling very weak, though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a chair. His mind was quite clear; his face looked very tired, yet bright and almost joyful. It wore an expression of gayety, kindness and cordiality. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Maybe I shall not live through the coming day,&#8221;</span> he said to Alyosha. Then he desired to confess and take the sacrament at once. He always confessed to Father Pa&#239;ssy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction followed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled up by the inmates of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight. People began coming from the monastery. After the service was over the elder desired to kiss and take leave of every one. As the cell was so small the earlier visitors withdrew to make room for others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was seated again in his arm-chair. He talked as much as he could. Though his voice was weak, it was fairly steady.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've been teaching you so many years, and therefore I've been talking aloud so many years, that I've got into the habit of talking, and so much so that it's almost more difficult for me to hold my tongue than to talk, even now, in spite of my weakness, dear Fathers and brothers,&#8221;</span> he jested, looking with emotion at the group round him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them. But though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady, his speech was somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg177"></a> things, he seemed anxious before the moment of death to say everything he had not said in his life, and not simply for the sake of instructing them, but as though thirsting to share with all men and all creation his joy and ecstasy, and once more in his life to open his whole heart.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Love one another, Fathers,&#8221;</span> said Father Zossima, as far as Alyosha could remember afterwards. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Love God's people. Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men on earth.... And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly he must recognize that. Else he would have had no reason to come here. When he realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained. For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individual man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man. For monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought to be. Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite, universal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even when perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions with God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the great. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse and slander you. Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the materialists&#8212;and I mean not only the good ones&#8212;for there are many good ones among them, especially in our day&#8212;hate not even the wicked ones. Remember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none to pray for them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is not in pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all men.... Love God's people, let not strangers draw away the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg178"></a> flock, for if you slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride, or worse still, in covetousness, they will come from all sides and draw away your flock. Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ... be not extortionate.... Do not love gold and silver, do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling to the banner and raise it on high.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported his words afterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though to take breath, and recover his strength, but he was in a sort of ecstasy. They heard him with emotion, though many wondered at his words and found them obscure.... Afterwards all remembered those words.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was struck by the general excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding about it. This anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety, in others by devout solemnity. All were expecting that some marvel would happen immediately after the elder's death. Their suspense was, from one point of view, almost frivolous, but even the most austere of the monks were affected by it. Father Pa&#239;ssy's face looked the gravest of all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who had arrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame Hohlakov. In it she informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident. It appeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receive Father Zossima's blessing, there had been an old woman from the town, a sergeant's widow, called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might pray for the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to Irkutsk, and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery. He afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;as though reading the book of the future&#8221;</span> (this was Madame Hohlakov's expression), words of comfort: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that her son Vassya was certainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly or send a letter, and that she was to go home and expect him.&#8221;</span> And <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Would you believe it?&#8221;</span> exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg179"></a> that.&#8221;</span> Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was not all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, and that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;to embrace his mother.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;miracle of prediction&#8221;</span> to the Superior and all the brotherhood. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;All, all, ought to know of it!&#8221;</span> she concluded. The letter had been written in haste, the excitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it. But Alyosha had no need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already. Rakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his message <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;to inform most respectfully his reverence Father Pa&#239;ssy, that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of with him, of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment, and humbly begs forgiveness for his presumption.&#8221;</span> As the monk had given the message to Father Pa&#239;ssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after reading the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to Father Pa&#239;ssy in confirmation of the story.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as he read the news of the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;miracle,&#8221;</span> could not completely restrain some inner emotion. His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came into his lips.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We shall see greater things!&#8221;</span> broke from him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We shall see greater things, greater things yet!&#8221;</span> the monks around repeated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Father Pa&#239;ssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least for a time, not to speak of the matter <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;till it be more fully confirmed, seeing there is so much credulity among those of this world, and indeed this might well have chanced naturally,&#8221;</span> he added, prudently, as it were to satisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing his own disavowal, a fact his listeners very clearly perceived.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Within the hour the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;miracle&#8221;</span> was of course known to the whole monastery, and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one seemed more impressed by it than the monk who had come the day before from St. Sylvester, from the little monastery of Obdorsk in the far North. It was he who had been standing near Madame Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father Zossima earnestly, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg180"></a> referring to the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;healing&#8221;</span> of the lady's daughter, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How can you presume to do such things?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe. The evening before he had visited Father Ferapont in his cell apart, behind the apiary, and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit. This Father Ferapont was that aged monk so devout in fasting and observing silence who has been mentioned already, as antagonistic to Father Zossima and the whole institution of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;elders,&#8221;</span> which he regarded as a pernicious and frivolous innovation. He was a very formidable opponent, although from his practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one. What made him formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling, and many of the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and ascetic, although they had no doubt that he was crazy. But it was just his craziness attracted them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived in the hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and this too because he behaved as though he were crazy. He was seventy-five or more, and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying wooden cell which had been built long ago for another great ascetic, Father Iona, who had lived to be a hundred and five, and of whose saintly doings many curious stories were still extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in this same solitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasant's hut, though it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary number of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them&#8212;which men brought to the monastery as offerings to God. Father Ferapont had been appointed to look after them and keep the lamps burning. It was said (and indeed it was true) that he ate only two pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper, who lived close by the apiary, used to bring him the bread every three days, and even to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarely uttered a word. The four pounds of bread, together with the sacrament bread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass by the Father Superior, made up his weekly rations. The water in his jug was changed every day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who came to do him homage saw him sometimes kneeling all day long at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg181"></a> prayer without looking round. If he addressed them, he was brief, abrupt, strange, and almost always rude. On very rare occasions, however, he would talk to visitors, but for the most part he would utter some one strange saying which was a complete riddle, and no entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in explanation. He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange belief, chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had communication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with them, and so was silent with men.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by the beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to the corner where Father Ferapont's cell stood. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Maybe he will speak as you are a stranger and maybe you'll get nothing out of him,&#8221;</span> the beekeeper had warned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached in the utmost apprehension. It was rather late in the evening. Father Ferapont was sitting at the door of his cell on a low bench. A huge old elm was lightly rustling overhead. There was an evening freshness in the air. The monk from Obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his blessing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?&#8221;</span> said Father Ferapont. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Get up!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The monk got up.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come from?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his strict fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous old man. He was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh and healthy face. There was no doubt he still had considerable strength. He was of athletic build. In spite of his great age he was not even quite gray, and still had very thick hair and a full beard, both of which had once been black. His eyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spoke with a broad accent. He was dressed in a peasant's long reddish coat of coarse convict cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope round his waist. His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat, his shirt of the coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been changed for months. They said that he wore irons weighing thirty <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg182"></a> pounds under his coat. His stockingless feet were thrust in old slippers almost dropping to pieces.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,&#8221;</span> the monk answered humbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather frightened little eyes kept watch on the hermit.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have been at your Sylvester's. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The monk hesitated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During Lent there are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. For Tuesday and Thursday we have white bread, stewed fruit with honey, wild berries, or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout. On Saturday white cabbage soup, noodles with peas, kasha, all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried fish and kasha with the cabbage soup. From Monday till Saturday evening, six whole days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and water, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just the same as is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing is eaten. In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till three o'clock, and then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of wine. On Holy Thursday we drink wine and have something cooked without oil or not cooked at all, inasmuch as the Laodicean council lays down for Holy Thursday: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It is unseemly by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to dishonor the whole of Lent!&#8217;</span> This is how we keep the fast. But what is that compared with you, holy Father,&#8221;</span> added the monk, growing more confident, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing but bread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full seven. It's truly marvelous&#8212;your great abstinence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And mushrooms?&#8221;</span> asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mushrooms?&#8221;</span> repeated the surprised monk.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries, but they can't give up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage to the devil. Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such fasting. Haughty and unclean is their judgment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Och, true,&#8221;</span> sighed the monk.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg183"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And have you seen devils among them?&#8221;</span> asked Ferapont.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Among them? Among whom?&#8221;</span> asked the monk, timidly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I haven't been since. I saw a devil sitting on one man's chest hiding under his cassock, only his horns poked out; another had one peeping out of his pocket with such sharp eyes, he was afraid of me; another settled in the unclean belly of one, another was hanging round a man's neck, and so he was carrying him about without seeing him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You&#8212;can see spirits?&#8221;</span> the monk inquired.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming out from the Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the door, and a big one, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick long gray tail, and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door and I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his tail in it. He squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross over him three times. And he died on the spot like a crushed spider. He must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking, but they don't see, they don't smell it. It's a year since I have been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,&#8221;</span> said the monk, growing bolder and bolder, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;is it true, as they noise abroad even to distant lands about you, that you are in continual communication with the Holy Ghost?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He does fly down at times.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How does he fly down? In what form?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As a bird.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's the Holy Ghost and there's the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can appear as other birds&#8212;sometimes as a swallow, sometimes a goldfinch and sometimes as a blue-tit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do you know him from an ordinary tit?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He speaks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How does he speak, in what language?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Human language.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And what does he tell you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would ask me unseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg184"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,&#8221;</span> the monk shook his head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened little eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you see this tree?&#8221;</span> asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I do, blessed Father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You think it's an elm, but for me it has another shape.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What sort of shape?&#8221;</span> inquired the monk, after a pause of vain expectation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night it is Christ holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those arms, I see it clearly and tremble. It's terrible, terrible!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is there terrible if it's Christ Himself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, He'll snatch me up and carry me away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alive?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven't you heard? He will take me in His arms and bear me away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one of the brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished at heart a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father Zossima. He was strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not strange that one who kept so rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;see marvels.&#8221;</span> His words seemed certainly queer, but God only could tell what was hidden in those words, and were not worse words and acts commonly seen in those who have sacrificed their intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of the devil's tail he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the figurative sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong prejudice against the institution of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;elders,&#8221;</span> which he only knew of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before he had been long at the monastery, he had detected the secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the institution. He was, besides, a meddlesome, inquisitive man, who poked his nose into everything. This was why the news of the fresh <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;miracle&#8221;</span> performed by Father Zossima reduced him to extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting to and fro from one group to another, listening and asking questions among the monks that were crowding within and without the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg185"></a> elder's cell. But he did not pay much attention to him at the time, and only recollected it afterwards.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima, feeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of Alyosha as he was closing his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran at once. There was no one else in the cell but Father Pa&#239;ssy, Father Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. The elder, opening his weary eyes and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him suddenly:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are your people expecting you, my son?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha hesitated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Haven't they need of you? Didn't you promise some one yesterday to see them to-day?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I did promise&#8212;to my father&#8212;my brothers&#8212;others too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, you must go. Don't grieve. Be sure I shall not die without your being by to hear my last word. To you I will say that word, my son, it will be my last gift to you. To you, dear son, because you love me. But now go to keep your promise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the promise that he should hear his last word on earth, that it should be the last gift to him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his soul. He made haste that he might finish what he had to do in the town and return quickly. Father Pa&#239;ssy, too, uttered some words of exhortation which moved and surprised him greatly. He spoke as they left the cell together.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Remember, young man, unceasingly,&#8221;</span> Father Pa&#239;ssy began, without preface, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that the science of this world, which has become a great power, has, especially in the last century, analyzed everything divine handed down to us in the holy books. After this cruel analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was sacred of old. But they have only analyzed the parts and overlooked the whole, and indeed their blindness is marvelous. Yet the whole still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul and in the masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in the souls of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg186"></a> nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old. When it has been attempted, the result has been only grotesque. Remember this especially, young man, since you are being sent into the world by your departing elder. Maybe, remembering this great day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the heart for your guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the world are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, my orphan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">With these words Father Pa&#239;ssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the monastery and thought them over, he suddenly realized that he had met a new and unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in this austere monk who had hitherto treated him sternly. It was as though Father Zossima had bequeathed him to him at his death, and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;perhaps that's just what had passed between them,&#8221;</span> Alyosha thought suddenly. The philosophic reflections he had just heard so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of Father Pa&#239;ssy's heart. He was in haste to arm the boy's mind for conflict with temptation and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the strongest defense he could imagine.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00032"><span class="c9">Chapter II. At His Father's</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">First of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered that his father had insisted the day before that he should come without his brother Ivan seeing him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why so?&#8221;</span> Alyosha wondered suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Even if my father has something to say to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most likely in his excitement yesterday he meant to say something different,&#8221;</span> he decided. Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the garden gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge), told him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone out two hours ago.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And my father?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is up, taking his coffee,&#8221;</span> Marfa answered somewhat dryly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg187"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table wearing slippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself by looking through some accounts, rather inattentively however. He was quite alone in the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out marketing. Though he had got up early and was trying to put a bold face on it, he looked tired and weak. His forehead, upon which huge purple bruises had come out during the night, was bandaged with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollen terribly in the night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches, giving his whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The old man was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he came in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The coffee is cold,&#8221;</span> he cried harshly; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I won't offer you any. I've ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don't invite any one to share it. Why have you come?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To find out how you are,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It's all of no consequence. You need not have troubled. But I knew you'd come poking in directly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he got up and looked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the fortieth time that morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his red handkerchief more becomingly on his forehead.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Red's better. It's just like the hospital in a white one,&#8221;</span> he observed sententiously. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, how are things over there? How is your elder?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is very bad; he may die to-day,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha. But his father had not listened, and had forgotten his own question at once.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan's gone out,&#8221;</span> he said suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is doing his utmost to carry off Mitya's betrothed. That's what he is staying here for,&#8221;</span> he added maliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Surely he did not tell you so?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three weeks ago? You don't suppose he too came to murder me, do you? He must have had some object in coming.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean? Why do you say such things?&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, troubled.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg188"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He doesn't ask for money, it's true, but yet he won't get a farthing from me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well know, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing, and the longer I live, the more I shall need it,&#8221;</span> he continued, pacing from one corner of the room to the other, keeping his hands in the pockets of his loose greasy overcoat made of yellow cotton material. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I can still pass for a man at five and fifty, but I want to pass for one for another twenty years. As I get older, you know, I shan't be a pretty object. The wenches won't come to me of their own accord, so I shall want my money. So I am saving up more and more, simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may as well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell you. For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others do it on the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall upon me for being so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch, is not to my taste, let me tell you that; and it's not the proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up again, and that's all. You can pray for my soul if you like. And if you don't want to, don't, damn you! That's my philosophy. Ivan talked well here yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is a conceited coxcomb, but he has no particular learning ... nor education either. He sits silent and smiles at one without speaking&#8212;that's what pulls him through.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha listened to him in silence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why won't he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself airs. Your Ivan is a scoundrel! And I'll marry Grushenka in a minute if I want to. For if you've money, Alexey Fyodorovitch, you have only to want a thing and you can have it. That's what Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch to prevent me getting married and that's why he is egging on Mitya to marry Grushenka himself. He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though I should leave him my money if I don't marry her!). Besides if Mitya marries Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that's what he's reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better lie down,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There! you say that,&#8221;</span> the old man observed suddenly, as though <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg189"></a> it had struck him for the first time, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and I am not angry with you. But if Ivan said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you I have good moments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are not ill-natured, but distorted,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha with a smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked up and I don't know now what I shall decide about it. Of course in these fashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a prejudice, but even now the law does not allow you to drag your old father about by the hair, to kick him in the face in his own house, and brag of murdering him outright&#8212;all in the presence of witnesses. If I liked, I could crush him and could have him locked up at once for what he did yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then you don't mean to take proceedings?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn't care about Ivan, but there's another thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I send the ruffian to prison, she'll hear of it and run to see him at once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old man, within an inch of my life, she may give him up and come to me.... For that's her way, everything by contraries. I know her through and through! Won't you have a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee and I'll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy into it, it's delicious, my boy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, thank you. I'll take that roll with me if I may,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket of his cassock. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you'd better not have brandy, either,&#8221;</span> he suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man's face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them. Only one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's enough. One glass won't kill me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see you are in a better humor now,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, smiling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I am a scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya&#8212;why is that? He wants to spy how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg190"></a> are all scoundrels! But I don't recognize Ivan, I don't know him at all. Where does he come from? He is not one of us in soul. As though I'd leave him anything! I shan't leave a will at all, you may as well know. And I'll crush Mitya like a beetle. I squash black-beetles at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread on them. And your Mitya will squelch too. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">Your</span></em> Mitya, for you love him. Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him. But if Ivan loved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving him. But Ivan loves nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like Ivan are not our sort, my boy. They are like a cloud of dust. When the wind blows, the dust will be gone.... I had a silly idea in my head when I told you to come to-day; I wanted to find out from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over a thousand or maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself off altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without Grushenka, and give her up once for all, eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I&#8212;I'll ask him,&#8221;</span> muttered Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If you would give him three thousand, perhaps he&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's nonsense! You needn't ask him now, no need! I've changed my mind. It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won't give him anything, not a penny, I want my money myself,&#8221;</span> cried the old man, waving his hand. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll crush him like a beetle without it. Don't say anything to him or else he will begin hoping. There's nothing for you to do here, you needn't stay. Is that betrothed of his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefully hidden from me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to see her yesterday, I believe?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nothing will induce her to abandon him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and a scoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young ladies, very different from&#8212;Ah, if I had his youth and the looks I had then (for I was better-looking than he at eight and twenty) I'd have been a conquering hero just as he is. He is a low cad! But he shan't have Grushenka, anyway, he shan't! I'll crush him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">His anger had returned with the last words.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You can go. There's nothing for you to do here to-day,&#8221;</span> he snapped harshly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg191"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's that for?&#8221;</span> The old man was a little surprised. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We shall see each other again, or do you think we shan't?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not at all, I didn't mean anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nor did I, I did not mean anything,&#8221;</span> said the old man, looking at him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, listen,&#8221;</span> he shouted after him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;make haste and come again and I'll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like to-day. Be sure to come! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the cupboard again and poured out another half-glass.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I won't have more!&#8221;</span> he muttered, clearing his throat, and again he locked the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he went into his bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute he was asleep.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00033"><span class="c9">Chapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,&#8221;</span> thought Alyosha, as he left his father's house and turned towards Madame Hohlakov's, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;or I might have to tell him of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Father is spiteful and angry, he's made some plan and will stick to it. And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to-day, whatever happens.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression on him. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg192"></a> is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were going home from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others with leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear. The whole group was talking eagerly about something, apparently holding a council. Alyosha had never from his Moscow days been able to pass children without taking notice of them, and although he was particularly fond of children of three or thereabout, he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so, anxious as he was to-day, he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them. He looked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the boys had stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away, there was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a satchel at his side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking and with sparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and anxious watch on the other six, obviously his schoolfellows with whom he had just come out of school, but with whom he had evidently had a feud.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy in a black jacket, observed:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry it on my left side, so as to have my right hand free, but you've got yours on your right side. So it will be awkward for you to get at it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical remark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get at once into confidential relations with a child, or still more with a group of children. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way so as to be on a perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it by instinct.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he is left-handed,&#8221;</span> another, a fine healthy-looking boy of eleven, answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He even throws stones with his left hand,&#8221;</span> observed a third.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed the left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boy standing the other side of the ditch.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg193"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,&#8221;</span> they all shouted. But Smurov, the left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged himself; he threw a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the ground. The boy the other side of the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at the group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him painfully on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov, Karamazov!&#8221;</span> the boys shouted, laughing. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, all throw at him at once!&#8221;</span> and six stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the head and he fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire. Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many of the group had their pockets full too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you about! Aren't you ashamed? Six against one! Why, you'll kill him,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy. Three or four ceased throwing for a minute.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He began first!&#8221;</span> cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day with a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn't tell tales, but he must be thrashed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what for? I suppose you tease him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,&#8221;</span> cried the children. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all of you, at him again, don't miss, Smurov!&#8221;</span> and again a fire of stones, and a very vicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch was hit in the chest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill towards Mihailovsky Street. They all shouted: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Aha, he is funking, he is running away. Wisp of tow!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You don't know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too good for him,&#8221;</span> said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He seemed to be the eldest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's wrong with him?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;is he a tell-tale or what?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The boys looked at one another as though derisively.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?&#8221;</span> the same boy went on. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Catch him up.... You see he's stopped again, he is waiting and looking at you.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg194"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is looking at you,&#8221;</span> the other boys chimed in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you hear, ask him that!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them, and they at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't go near him, he'll hurt you,&#8221;</span> cried Smurov in a warning voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shan't ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease him with that question somehow. But I'll find out from him why you hate him so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Find out then, find out,&#8221;</span> cried the boys, laughing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence, straight towards the boy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You'd better look out,&#8221;</span> the boys called after him; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;he won't be afraid of you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did Krassotkin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him, Alyosha saw facing him a child of about nine years old. He was an undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both the pockets of his great-coat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him. The boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he wouldn't beat him, became less defiant, and addressed him first.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all, alone!&#8221;</span> he said suddenly, with flashing eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,&#8221;</span> observed Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I hit Smurov on the head!&#8221;</span> cried the boy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me on purpose,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The boy looked darkly at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know you. Do you know me?&#8221;</span> Alyosha continued.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let me alone!&#8221;</span> the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg195"></a> though he were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in his eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very well, I am going,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;only I don't know you and I don't tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don't want to tease you. Good-by!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Monk in silk trousers!&#8221;</span> cried the boy, following Alyosha with the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself into an attitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked away. He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they say that you attack on the sly,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, turning round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the elbow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you?&#8221;</span> he cried.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a little wild beast's; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child let go at last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha's finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it began to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very well,&#8221;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;you see how badly you've bitten me. That's enough, isn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The boy stared in amazement.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Though I don't know you and it's the first time I've seen you,&#8221;</span> Alyosha went on with the same serenity, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;yet I must have done something to you&#8212;you wouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing. So what have I done? How have I wronged you, tell me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg196"></a> ran away. Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky Street, and for a long time he saw the child running in the distance as fast as ever, not turning his head, and no doubt still keeping up his tearful wail. He made up his mind to find him out as soon as he had time, and to solve this mystery. Just now he had not the time.</p>
