<p class="tei tei-p c3">And Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor Pavlovitch's house. But, strange to say, he was overcome by insufferable depression, which grew greater at every step he took <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg292"></a> towards the house. There was nothing strange in his being depressed; what was strange was that Ivan could not have said what was the cause of it. He had often been depressed before, and there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when he had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new, unknown future. He would again be as solitary as ever, and though he had great hopes, and great&#8212;too great&#8212;expectations from life, he could not have given any definite account of his hopes, his expectations, or even his desires.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown certainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him was something quite different. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is it loathing for my father's house?&#8221;</span> he wondered. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though it's the last time I shall cross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it.... No, it's not that either. Is it the parting with Alyosha and the conversation I had with him? For so many years I've been silent with the whole world and not deigned to speak, and all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.&#8221;</span> It certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthful inexperience and vanity&#8212;vexation at having failed to express himself, especially with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly been reckoning. No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done indeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I feel sick with depression and yet I can't tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan tried <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;not to think,&#8221;</span> but that, too, was no use. What made his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual, external character&#8212;he felt that. Some person or thing seemed to be standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude itself upon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice it, yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realizes, and removes the offending object, often quite a trifling and ridiculous one&#8212;some article left about in the wrong place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on the shelf, and so on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At last, feeling very cross and ill-humored, Ivan arrived home, and suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed what was fretting and worrying him.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg293"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him Ivan knew that the valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it was this man that his soul loathed. It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear. Just before, when Alyosha had been telling him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had felt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred responsive anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov had been forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind, and as soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgotten sensation began to obtrude itself again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is it possible that a miserable, contemptible creature like that can worry me so much?&#8221;</span> he wondered, with insufferable irritation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike for the man, especially during the last few days. He had even begun to notice in himself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the creature. Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when Ivan first came to the neighborhood he had felt quite differently. Then he had taken a marked interest in Smerdyakov, and had even thought him very original. He had encouraged him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at a certain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could not understand what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon the brain of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the contemplative.&#8221;</span> They discussed philosophical questions and even how there could have been light on the first day when the sun, moon, and stars were only created on the fourth day, and how that was to be understood. But Ivan soon saw that, though the sun, moon, and stars might be an interesting subject, yet that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov, and that he was looking for something altogether different. In one way and another, he began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too, and that Ivan disliked. It had first given rise to his aversion. Later on, there had been trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on the scene, and there had been the scandals with his brother Dmitri&#8212;they discussed that, too. But though Smerdyakov always talked of that with great excitement, it was impossible to discover what he desired to come of it. There was, in fact, something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some of his desires, accidentally <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg294"></a> betrayed and always vaguely expressed. Smerdyakov was always inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously premeditated questions, but what his object was he did not explain, and usually at the most important moment he would break off and relapse into silence or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated Ivan most and confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting familiarity which Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly. Not that he forgot himself and was rude; on the contrary, he always spoke very respectfully, yet he had obviously begun to consider&#8212;goodness knows why!&#8212;that there was some sort of understanding between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch. He always spoke in a tone that suggested that those two had some kind of compact, some secret between them, that had at some time been expressed on both sides, only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around them. But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of his growing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the root of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">With a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at the gate without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov rose from the bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew instantly that he wanted particularly to talk to him. Ivan looked at him and stopped, and the fact that he did stop, instead of passing by, as he meant to the minute before, drove him to fury. With anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakov's emasculate, sickly face, with the little curls combed forward on his forehead. His left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where are you going? You won't pass by; you see that we two clever people have something to say to each other.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan shook. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with you?&#8221;</span> was on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment he heard himself say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is my father still asleep, or has he waked?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise, and at once, again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For an instant he felt almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards. Smerdyakov stood facing him, his hands behind his back, looking at him with assurance and almost severity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;His honor is still asleep,&#8221;</span> he articulated deliberately (<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg295"></a> the first to speak, not I,&#8221;</span> he seemed to say). <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am surprised at you, sir,&#8221;</span> he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting his right foot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why are you surprised at me?&#8221;</span> Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly, doing his utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing, with disgust, that he was feeling intense curiosity and would not, on any account, have gone away without satisfying it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why don't you go to Tchermashnya, sir?&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov suddenly raised his eyes and smiled familiarly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why I smile you must understand of yourself, if you are a clever man,&#8221;</span> his screwed-up left eye seemed to say.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why should I go to Tchermashnya?&#8221;</span> Ivan asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov was silent again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,&#8221;</span> he said at last, slowly and apparently attaching no significance to his answer. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I put you off with a secondary reason,&#8221;</span> he seemed to suggest, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;simply to say something.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Damn you! Speak out what you want!&#8221;</span> Ivan cried angrily at last, passing from meekness to violence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up, but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Substantially nothing&#8212;but just by way of conversation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute. Ivan knew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov stood before him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he would be angry or not. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last he moved to get up. Smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don't know how to help myself,&#8221;</span> he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last word he sighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little children,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov went on. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am speaking of your parent and your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get up directly and begin worrying me every minute, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Has she come? Why hasn't she come?&#8217;</span> and so on up till midnight and even after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna doesn't come (for very likely she does not mean to come at all) then he will be at me <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg296"></a> again to-morrow morning, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why hasn't she come? When will she come?&#8217;</span>&#8212;as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it's no better. As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother will appear with his gun in his hands: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Look out, you rogue, you soup-maker. If you miss her and don't let me know she's been&#8212;I'll kill you before any one.&#8217;</span> When the night's over, in the morning, he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins worrying me to death. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why hasn't she come? Will she come soon?&#8217;</span> And he, too, thinks me to blame because his lady hasn't come. And every day and every hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall kill myself in a fright. I can't depend upon them, sir.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for Dmitri Fyodorovitch?&#8221;</span> said Ivan irritably.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven't meddled at all, if you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet from the very beginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on me to be his servant. He has had only one thing to say since: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll kill you, you scoundrel, if you miss her,&#8217;</span> I feel certain, sir, that I shall have a long fit to-morrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean by <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;a long fit&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A long fit, lasting a long time&#8212;several hours, or perhaps a day or two. Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret that time. The struggling ceased and then began again, and for three days I couldn't come back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Herzenstube, the doctor here, and he put ice on my head and tried another remedy, too.... I might have died.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But they say one can't tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming. What makes you say you will have one to-morrow?&#8221;</span> Ivan inquired, with a peculiar, irritable curiosity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's just so. You can't tell beforehand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Besides, you fell from the garret then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret again to-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps. I have to go into the cellar every day, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan took a long look at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don't quite understand you,&#8221;</span> he said softly, but with a sort of menace. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you mean to pretend to be ill to-morrow for three days, eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg297"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing with the toe of his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one forward, and, grinning, articulated:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fit&#8212;and it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them&#8212;I should have a perfect right to use such a means to save myself from death. For even if Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father while I am ill, his honor can't blame a sick man for not telling him. He'd be ashamed to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hang it all!&#8221;</span> Ivan cried, his face working with anger, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;why are you always in such a funk for your life? All my brother Dmitri's threats are only hasty words and mean nothing. He won't kill you; it's not you he'll kill!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He'd kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that, I am afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does something crazy to his father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why should you be taken for an accomplice?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They'll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the signals as a great secret.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more plainly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm bound to admit the fact,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic composure, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in this business. As you know yourself (if only you do know it) he has for several days past locked himself in as soon as night or even evening comes on. Of late you've been going upstairs to your room early every evening, and yesterday you did not come down at all, and so perhaps you don't know how carefully he has begun to lock himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to the door he won't open to him till he hears his voice. But Grigory Vassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his room now. That's the arrangement he made himself ever since this to-do with Agrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his orders, I go away to the lodge so that I don't get to sleep till midnight, but am on the watch, getting up and walking about the yard, waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna to come. For the last few days he's been perfectly frantic expecting her. What he argues is, she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he calls him), <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg298"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and so,&#8217;</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;she'll come the back-way, late at night, to me. You look out for her,&#8217;</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;till midnight and later; and if she does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window from the garden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then three times more quickly, then,&#8217;</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I shall understand at once that she has come, and will open the door to you quietly.&#8217;</span> Another signal he gave me in case anything unexpected happens. At first, two knocks, and then, after an interval, another much louder. Then he will understand that something has happened suddenly and that I must see him, and he will open to me so that I can go and speak to him. That's all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can't come herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch might come, too, so I must let him know he is near. His honor is awfully afraid of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna had come and were locked in with him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch were to turn up anywhere near at the time, I should be bound to let him know at once, knocking three times. So that the first signal of five knocks means Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, while the second signal of three knocks means <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;something important to tell you.&#8217;</span> His honor has shown me them several times and explained them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of these signals but myself and his honor, so he'd open the door without the slightest hesitation and without calling out (he is awfully afraid of calling out aloud). Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch too, now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you tell him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it back from him? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You are deceiving me, you are hiding something from me! I'll break both your legs for you.&#8217;</span> So I told him those secret signals that he might see my slavish devotion, and might be satisfied that I was not deceiving him, but was telling him all I could.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If you think that he'll make use of those signals and try to get in, don't let him in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him coming in then, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate he is?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg299"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit, confound you? Are you laughing at me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor with this fear on me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a presentiment. Fright alone will bring it on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch. Let Grigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the signals without orders from my master. And as for Grigory Vassilyevitch hearing him and not admitting him, he has been ill ever since yesterday, and Marfa Ignatyevna intends to give him medicine to-morrow. They've just arranged it. It's a very strange remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of a preparation and always keeps it. It's a strong thing made from some herb. She has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitch three times a year when his lumbago's so bad he is almost paralyzed by it. Then she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his whole back for half an hour till it's quite red and swollen, and what's left in the bottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer; but not quite all, for on such occasions she leaves some for herself, and drinks it herself. And as they never take strong drink, I assure you they both drop asleep at once and sleep sound a very long time. And when Grigory Vassilyevitch wakes up he is perfectly well after it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a headache from it. So, if Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention to-morrow, they won't hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They'll be asleep.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though it were planned. You'll have a fit and they'll both be unconscious,&#8221;</span> cried Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But aren't you trying to arrange it so?&#8221;</span> broke from him suddenly, and he frowned threateningly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on Dmitri Fyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything, he'll do it; but if not, I shan't be thrusting him upon his father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you say yourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won't come at all?&#8221;</span> Ivan went on, turning white with anger. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You say that yourself, and all the while I've been here, I've felt sure it was all the old man's fancy, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg300"></a> and the creature won't come to him. Why should Dmitri break in on him if she doesn't come? Speak, I want to know what you are thinking!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know yourself why he'll come. What's the use of what I think? His honor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious on account of my illness perhaps, and he'll dash in, as he did yesterday through impatience to search the rooms, to see whether she hasn't escaped him on the sly. He is perfectly well aware, too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a big envelope with three thousand roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealed with three seals. On it is written in his own hand, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;To my angel Grushenka, if she will come,&#8217;</span> to which he added three days later, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;for my little chicken.&#8217;</span> There's no knowing what that might do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</span> cried Ivan, almost beside himself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Dmitri won't come to steal money and kill my father to do it. He might have killed him yesterday on account of Grushenka, like the frantic, savage fool he is, but he won't steal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is in very great need of money now&#8212;the greatest need, Ivan Fyodorovitch. You don't know in what need he is,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov explained, with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He looks on that three thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;My father still owes me just three thousand,&#8217;</span> he said. And besides that, consider, Ivan Fyodorovitch, there is something else perfectly true. It's as good as certain, so to say, that Agrafena Alexandrovna will force him, if only she cares to, to marry her&#8212;the master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch&#8212;if only she cares to, and of course she may care to. All I've said is that she won't come, but maybe she's looking for more than that&#8212;I mean to be mistress here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughing with her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all a stupid thing to do. And she's got plenty of sense. She wouldn't marry a beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into consideration, Ivan Fyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourself and your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, would have anything after the master's death, not a rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him simply to get hold of the whole, all the money there is. But if your father were to die now, there'd be some forty thousand for sure, even for Dmitri Fyodorovitch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg301"></a> whom he hates so, for he's made no will.... Dmitri Fyodorovitch knows all that very well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A sort of shudder passed over Ivan's face. He suddenly flushed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then why on earth,&#8221;</span> he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;do you advise me to go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by that? If I go away, you see what will happen here.&#8221;</span> Ivan drew his breath with difficulty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Precisely so,&#8221;</span> said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan intently, however.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean by <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;precisely so&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span> Ivan questioned him, with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,&#8221;</span> answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan's flashing eyes. They were both silent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what's more ... an awful scoundrel, too.&#8221;</span> Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know&#8212;early to-morrow morning. That's all!&#8221;</span> he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's the best thing you can do,&#8221;</span> he responded, as though he had expected to hear it; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;except that you can always be telegraphed for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But a change had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and carelessness had completely disappeared. His face expressed attention and expectation, intent but timid and cringing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Haven't you something more to say&#8212;something to add?&#8221;</span> could be read in the intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg302"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And couldn't I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too&#8212;in case anything happened?&#8221;</span> Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason raising his voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov muttered, almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing intently into Ivan's eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to save my spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out of my way, that you insist on Tchermashnya?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Precisely so ...&#8221;</span> muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He looked at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw back. But to his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went through the gate still laughing. Any one who had seen his face at that moment would have known that he was not laughing from lightness of heart, and he could not have explained himself what he was feeling at that instant. He moved and walked as though in a nervous frenzy.</p>

<span class="c9">Chapter VII.</span> <span class="tei tei-q c25"><span class="c9">&#8220;</span><span class="c9">It's Always Worth While Speaking To A Clever Man</span><span class="c9">&#8221;</span></span>
</h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor Pavlovitch in the drawing-room directly he went in, he shouted to him, waving his hands, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am going upstairs to my room, not in to you. Good-by!&#8221;</span> and passed by, trying not even to look at his father. Very possibly the old man was too hateful to him at that moment; but such an unceremonious display of hostility was a surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old man evidently wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet him in the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going upstairs, till he passed out of sight.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's the matter with him?&#8221;</span> he promptly asked Smerdyakov, who had followed Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Angry about something. Who can tell?&#8221;</span> the valet muttered evasively.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg303"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Confound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar, and get along with you. Look sharp! No news?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Then followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just complained of to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and these questions we will omit. Half an hour later the house was locked, and the crazy old man was wandering along through the rooms in excited expectation of hearing every minute the five knocks agreed upon. Now and then he peered out into the darkness, seeing nothing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat up late that night, till two o'clock. But we will not give an account of his thoughts, and this is not the place to look into that soul&#8212;its turn will come. And even if one tried, it would be very hard to give an account of them, for there were no thoughts in his brain, but something very vague, and, above all, intense excitement. He felt himself that he had lost his bearings. He was fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and almost surprising desires; for instance, after midnight he suddenly had an intense irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to the lodge and beat Smerdyakov. But if he had been asked why, he could not have given any exact reason, except perhaps that he loathed the valet as one who had insulted him more gravely than any one in the world. On the other hand, he was more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable humiliating terror, which he felt positively paralyzed his physical powers. His head ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred was rankling in his heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on some one. He even hated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had just had with him. At moments he hated himself intensely. Of Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot to think, and wondered greatly at this afterwards, especially as he remembered perfectly that when he had protested so valiantly to Katerina Ivanovna that he would go away next day to Moscow, something had whispered in his heart, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's nonsense, you are not going, and it won't be so easy to tear yourself away as you are boasting now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with peculiar repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and had stealthily, as though he were afraid of being watched, opened the door, gone out on the staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg304"></a> stirring down below, had listened a long while&#8212;some five minutes&#8212;with a sort of strange curiosity, holding his breath while his heart throbbed. And why he had done all this, why he was listening, he could not have said. That <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;action&#8221;</span> all his life afterwards he called <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;infamous,&#8221;</span> and at the bottom of his heart, he thought of it as the basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitch himself he felt no hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious to know how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing now. He wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of the dark windows and stopping in the middle of the room, listening, listening&#8212;for some one to knock. Ivan went out on to the stairs twice to listen like this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">About two o'clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor Pavlovitch had gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved to fall asleep at once, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did fall asleep at once, and slept soundly without dreams, but waked early, at seven o'clock, when it was broad daylight. Opening his eyes, he was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous. He jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then dragged out his trunk and began packing immediately. His linen had come back from the laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled at the thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And his departure certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before (to Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was leaving next day, yet he remembered that he had no thought of departure when he went to bed, or, at least, had not dreamed that his first act in the morning would be to pack his trunk. At last his trunk and bag were ready. It was about nine o'clock when Marfa Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where will your honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?&#8221;</span> He looked almost cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and gestures, something hurried and scattered. Greeting his father affably, and even inquiring specially after his health, though he did not wait to hear his answer to the end, he announced that he was starting off in an hour to return to Moscow for good, and begged him to send for the horses. His father heard this announcement with no sign of surprise, and forgot in an unmannerly way to show <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg305"></a> regret at losing him. Instead of doing so, he flew into a great flutter at the recollection of some important business of his own.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never mind; we'll manage it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear boy. Go to Tchermashnya on the way. It's only to turn to the left from the station at Volovya, only another twelve versts and you come to Tchermashnya.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm sorry, I can't. It's eighty versts to the railway and the train starts for Moscow at seven o'clock to-night. I can only just catch it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You'll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off to Tchermashnya. It won't put you out much to humor your father! If I hadn't had something to keep me here, I would have run over myself long ago, for I've some business there in a hurry. But here I ... it's not the time for me to go now.... You see, I've two pieces of copse land there. The Maslovs, an old merchant and his son, will give eight thousand for the timber. But last year I just missed a purchaser who would have given twelve. There's no getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs have it all their own way. One has to take what they'll give, for no one here dare bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up. What makes him valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is not afraid of the Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand for the copse. Do you hear? But he'll only be here, the priest writes, for a week altogether, so you must go at once and make a bargain with him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, you write to the priest; he'll make the bargain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He can't do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect treasure, I'd give him twenty thousand to take care of for me without a receipt; but he has no eye for business, he is a perfect child, a crow could deceive him. And yet he is a learned man, would you believe it? This Gorstkin looks like a peasant, he wears a blue kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. That's the common complaint. He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you wonder why he is doing it. He told me the year before last that his wife was dead and that he had married another, and would you believe it, there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg306"></a> was not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she is alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what you have to find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth, when he says he wants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the signs by which you can judge about Gorstkin. I've done business with him a long time. You see, you must watch his beard; he has a nasty, thin, red beard. If his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross, it's all right, he is saying what he means, he wants to do business. But if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins&#8212;he is trying to cheat you. Don't watch his eyes, you won't find out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, a rogue&#8212;but watch his beard! I'll give you a note and you show it to him. He's called Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy<a href="the-brothers-karamazov-60.html#note_4" id="noteref_4" class="dlinternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c24">4</span></span></a>; but don't call him so, he will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him, and see it's all right, write here at once. You need only write: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He's not lying.&#8217;</span> Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock off, but not more. Just think! there's a difference between eight thousand and eleven thousand. It's as good as picking up three thousand; it's not so easy to find a purchaser, and I'm in desperate need of money. Only let me know it's serious, and I'll run over and fix it up. I'll snatch the time somehow. But what's the good of my galloping over, if it's all a notion of the priest's? Come, will you go?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, I can't spare the time. You must excuse me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, you might oblige your father. I shan't forget it. You've no heart, any of you&#8212;that's what it is? What's a day or two to you? Where are you going now&#8212;to Venice? Your Venice will keep another two days. I would have sent Alyosha, but what use is Alyosha in a thing like that? I send you just because you are a clever fellow. Do you suppose I don't see that? You know nothing about timber, but you've got an eye. All that is wanted is to see whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beard&#8212;if his beard shakes you know he is in earnest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself, then?&#8221;</span> cried Ivan, with a malignant smile.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg307"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy, but he caught the smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then you'll go, you'll go? I'll scribble the note for you at once.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know whether I shall go. I don't know. I'll decide on the way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you settle the matter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he'll send it on to me at once. And I won't delay you more than that. You can go to Venice. The priest will give you horses back to Volovya station.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent for the horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive, but to-day he seemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a word. He was quite unmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say. Ivan noticed this particularly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He must be bored with me,&#8221;</span> he thought. Only when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man began to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to hold out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it at once, and instantly pulled himself up.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!&#8221;</span> he repeated from the steps. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You'll come again some time or other? Mind you do come. I shall always be glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan got into the carriage.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by, Ivan! Don't be too hard on me!&#8221;</span> the father called for the last time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The whole household came out to take leave&#8212;Smerdyakov, Marfa and Grigory. Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated himself in the carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,&#8221;</span> broke suddenly from Ivan. Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and he laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it long after.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's a true saying then, that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;it's always worth while speaking to a clever man,&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span> answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at Ivan.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg308"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivan's soul, but he looked eagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees, at a flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all of a sudden he felt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver, and he felt intensely interested in an answer the peasant made him; but a minute later he realized that he was not catching anything, and that he had not really even taken in the peasant's answer. He was silent, and it was pleasant even so. The air was fresh, pure and cool, the sky bright. The images of Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind. But he softly smiled, blew softly on the friendly phantoms, and they flew away. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's plenty of time for them,&#8221;</span> he thought. They reached the station quickly, changed horses, and galloped to Volovya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why is it worth while speaking to a clever man? What did he mean by that?&#8221;</span> The thought seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And why did I tell him I was going to Tchermashnya?&#8221;</span> They reached Volovya station. Ivan got out of the carriage, and the drivers stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelve versts to Tchermashnya. He told them to harness the horses. He went into the station house, looked round, glanced at the overseer's wife, and suddenly went back to the entrance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I won't go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway by seven, brothers?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We shall just do it. Shall we get the carriage out?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At once. Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be sure. Mitri here will.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my father's, to Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, and tell him I haven't gone to Tchermashnya. Can you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course I can. I've known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And here's something for you, for I dare say he won't give you anything,&#8221;</span> said Ivan, laughing gayly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You may depend on it he won't.&#8221;</span> Mitya laughed too. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thank you, sir. I'll be sure to do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At seven o'clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Away with the past. I've done with the old world for ever, and may I have no news, no echo, from it. To a new life, new places <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg309"></a> and no looking back!&#8221;</span> But instead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom, and his heart ached with such anguish, as he had never known in his life before. He was thinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he was approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am a scoundrel,&#8221;</span> he whispered to himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son off. For two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy. But suddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant for every one in the house, and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch's equanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell down from the top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the yard and heard him in time. She did not see the fall, but heard his scream&#8212;the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to her&#8212;the scream of the epileptic falling in a fit. They could not tell whether the fit had come on him at the moment he was descending the steps, so that he must have fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the shock that had caused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be liable to them. They found him at the bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions and foaming at the mouth. It was thought at first that he must have broken something&#8212;an arm or a leg&#8212;and hurt himself, but <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God had preserved him,&#8221;</span> as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it&#8212;nothing of the kind had happened. But it was difficult to get him out of the cellar. They asked the neighbors to help and managed it somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the whole ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick man did not regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but then began again, and every one concluded that the same thing would happen, as had happened a year before, when he accidentally fell from the garret. They remembered that ice had been put on his head then. There was still ice in the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up. In the evening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at once. He was a most estimable old man, and the most careful and conscientious doctor in the province. After careful examination, he concluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have serious consequences; that meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand it, but that by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg310"></a> to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, he would venture to try something else. The invalid was taken to the lodge, to a room next to Grigory's and Marfa Ignatyevna's.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up with that day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the soup, compared with Smerdyakov's, was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;no better than dish-water,&#8221;</span> and the fowl was so dried up that it was impossible to masticate it. To her master's bitter, though deserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a very old one to begin with, and that she had never been trained as a cook. In the evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; he was informed that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days, was completely laid up by his lumbago. Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his tea as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house. He was in terrible excitement and suspense. That evening he reckoned on Grushenka's coming almost as a certainty. He had received from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that she had promised to come without fail.&#8221;</span> The incorrigible old man's heart throbbed with excitement; he paced up and down his empty rooms listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a second in the passage, for fear&#8212;which God forbid!&#8212;that she should be frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could say almost certainly that she would come!</p>
