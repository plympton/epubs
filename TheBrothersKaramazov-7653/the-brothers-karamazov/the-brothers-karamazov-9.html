<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00024"><span class="c9">Chapter VII. The Controversy</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Balaam's ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a strange one. Grigory had gone in the morning to make purchases, and had heard from the shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of a Russian soldier which had appeared in the newspaper of that day. This soldier had been taken prisoner in some remote part of Asia, and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death if he did not renounce Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to deny his faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and glorifying Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor Pavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and talk, if only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly good-humored and expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening to the story, he observed that they ought to make a saint of a soldier like that, and to take his skin to some monastery. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That would make the people flock, and bring the money in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means touched, but, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment Smerdyakov, who was standing by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov often waited at table towards the end of dinner, and since Ivan's arrival in our town he had done so every day.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you grinning at?&#8221;</span> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching the smile instantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, my opinion is,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly in a loud voice, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that if that laudable soldier's exploit was so very great there would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it if he had on such an emergency renounced, so to speak, the name of Christ and his own christening, to save by that same his life, for good deeds, by which, in the course of years to expiate his cowardice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could it not be a sin? You're talking nonsense. For that you'll go straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,&#8221;</span> put in Fyodor Pavlovitch.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg138"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch, as we have seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We're on your subject, your subject,&#8221;</span> he chuckled gleefully, making Alyosha sit down to listen.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As for mutton, that's not so, and there'll be nothing there for this, and there shouldn't be either, if it's according to justice,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov maintained stoutly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do you mean <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;according to justice&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch cried still more gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's a rascal, that's what he is!&#8221;</span> burst from Grigory. He looked Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,&#8221;</span> answered Smerdyakov with perfect composure. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You'd better consider yourself that, once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the Christian race, and they demand from me to curse the name of God and to renounce my holy christening, I am fully entitled to act by my own reason, since there would be no sin in it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you've said that before. Don't waste words. Prove it,&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Soup-maker!&#8221;</span> muttered Grigory contemptuously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as I say to those enemies, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;No, I'm not a Christian, and I curse my true God,&#8217;</span> then at once, by God's high judgment, I become immediately and specially anathema accursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as though I were a heathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but when I think of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am cut off. Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was really answering Fyodor Pavlovitch's questions, and was well aware of it, and intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan,&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;stoop down for me to whisper. He's got this all up for your benefit. He wants you to praise him. Praise him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan listened with perfect seriousness to his father's excited whisper.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg139"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch once more. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan, your ear again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I love you as I do Alyosha. Don't think I don't love you. Some brandy?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8212;But you're rather drunk yourself,&#8221;</span> thought Ivan, looking steadily at his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're anathema accursed, as it is,&#8221;</span> Grigory suddenly burst out, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and how dare you argue, you rascal, after that, if&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't scold him, Grigory, don't scold him,&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch cut him short.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time, and listen, for I haven't finished all I had to say. For at the very moment I become accursed, at that same highest moment, I become exactly like a heathen, and my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail. Isn't that so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Make haste and finish, my boy,&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him, sipping from his wine-glass with relish.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And if I've ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the enemy when they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian, seeing I had already been relieved by God Himself of my Christianity by reason of the thought alone, before I had time to utter a word to the enemy. And if I have already been discharged, in what manner and with what sort of justice can I be held responsible as a Christian in the other world for having denied Christ, when, through the very thought alone, before denying Him I had been relieved from my christening? If I'm no longer a Christian, then I can't renounce Christ, for I've nothing then to renounce. Who will hold an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even in heaven, for not having been born a Christian? And who would punish him for that, considering that you can't take two skins off one ox? For God Almighty Himself, even if He did make the Tatar responsible, when he dies would give him the smallest possible punishment, I imagine (since he must be punished), judging that he is not to blame if he has come into the world an unclean heathen, from heathen parents. The Lord God can't surely take a Tatar and say he was a Christian? That would mean that the Almighty <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg140"></a> would tell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth tell a lie, even in one word?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes nearly starting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand what was said, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and stood, looking like a man who has just hit his head against a wall. Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied his glass and went off into his shrill laugh.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He must have been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking Jesuit, who taught you? But you're talking nonsense, you casuist, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Don't cry, Grigory, we'll reduce him to smoke and ashes in a moment. Tell me this, O ass; you may be right before your enemies, but you have renounced your faith all the same in your own heart, and you say yourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed. And if once you're anathema they won't pat you on the head for it in hell. What do you say to that, my fine Jesuit?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but there was no special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the most ordinary.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How's that the most ordinary?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You lie, accursed one!&#8221;</span> hissed Grigory.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov went on, staid and unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous to the vanquished foe. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch; it is said in the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a mustard seed, and bid a mountain move into the sea, it will move without the least delay at your bidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I'm without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that's a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden. You'll see for yourself that it won't budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven't faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg141"></a> person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea&#8212;except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn't find them&#8212;if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I'm persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay!&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're quite right in saying it's characteristic of the people's faith,&#8221;</span> Ivan assented, with an approving smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It's true, isn't it, Alyosha? That's the Russian faith all over, isn't it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha firmly and gravely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that's Russian, isn't it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, that's purely Russian,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha smiling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I'll give it to you to-day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven't time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty-four hours in the day, so that one hasn't even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one's sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you'd nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn't have come to torture then, because I should only have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg142"></a> had to say at that instant to the mountain, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Move and crush the tormentor,&#8217;</span> and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should have walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God. But, suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to that mountain, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Crush these tormentors,&#8217;</span> and it hadn't crushed them, how could I have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such a dread hour of mortal terror? And apart from that, I should know already that I could not attain to the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven (for since the mountain had not moved at my word, they could not think very much of my faith up aloft, and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to come). So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to no good purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my back, even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my cry. And at such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one might lose one's reason from fear, so that one would not be able to think at all. And, therefore, how should I be particularly to blame if not seeing my advantage or reward there or here, I should, at least, save my skin. And so trusting fully in the grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that I might be altogether forgiven.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00025"><span class="c9">Chapter VIII. Over The Brandy</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had been so gay, suddenly began frowning. He frowned and gulped brandy, and it was already a glass too much.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Get along with you, Jesuits!&#8221;</span> he cried to the servants. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Go away, Smerdyakov. I'll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day, but be off! Don't cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She'll comfort you and put you to bed. The rascals won't let us sit in peace after dinner,&#8221;</span> he snapped peevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew at his word.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg143"></a> you he's so interested in. What have you done to fascinate him?&#8221;</span> he added to Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nothing whatever,&#8221;</span> answered Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's pleased to have a high opinion of me; he's a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material for revolution, however, when the time comes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For revolution?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There will be others and better ones. But there will be some like him as well. His kind will come first, and better ones after.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And when will the time come?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants are not very fond of listening to these soup-makers, so far.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, brother, but a Balaam's ass like that thinks and thinks, and the devil knows where he gets to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's storing up ideas,&#8221;</span> said Ivan, smiling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, I know he can't bear me, nor any one else, even you, though you fancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still with Alyosha, he despises Alyosha. But he doesn't steal, that's one thing, and he's not a gossip, he holds his tongue, and doesn't wash our dirty linen in public. He makes capital fish pasties too. But, damn him, is he worth talking about so much?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course he isn't.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant, generally speaking, needs thrashing. That I've always maintained. Our peasants are swindlers, and don't deserve to be pitied, and it's a good thing they're still flogged sometimes. Russia is rich in birches. If they destroyed the forests, it would be the ruin of Russia. I stand up for the clever people. We've left off thrashing the peasants, we've grown so clever, but they go on thrashing themselves. And a good thing too. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again,&#8217;</span> or how does it go? Anyhow, it will be measured. But Russia's all swinishness. My dear, if you only knew how I hate Russia.... That is, not Russia, but all this vice! But maybe I mean Russia. <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">Tout cela c'est de la cochonnerie</span></span>.... Do you know what I like? I like wit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've had another glass. That's enough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Wait a bit. I'll have one more, and then another, and then I'll stop. No, stay, you interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to an old man, and he told me: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;There's nothing we like so much as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg144"></a> sentencing girls to be thrashed, and we always give the lads the job of thrashing them. And the girl he has thrashed to-day, the young man will ask in marriage to-morrow. So it quite suits the girls, too,&#8217;</span> he said. There's a set of de Sades for you! But it's clever, anyway. Shall we go over and have a look at it, eh? Alyosha, are you blushing? Don't be bashful, child. I'm sorry I didn't stay to dinner at the Superior's and tell the monks about the girls at Mokroe. Alyosha, don't be angry that I offended your Superior this morning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then, of course, I'm to blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if there isn't a God at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? It's not enough to cut their heads off, for they keep back progress. Would you believe it, Ivan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No, you don't believe it as I see from your eyes. You believe what people say, that I'm nothing but a buffoon. Alyosha, do you believe that I'm nothing but a buffoon?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I don't believe it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I believe you don't, and that you speak the truth. You look sincere and you speak sincerely. But not Ivan. Ivan's supercilious.... I'd make an end of your monks, though, all the same. I'd take all that mystic stuff and suppress it, once for all, all over Russia, so as to bring all the fools to reason. And the gold and the silver that would flow into the mint!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But why suppress it?&#8221;</span> asked Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That Truth may prevail. That's why.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, if Truth were to prevail, you know, you'd be the first to be robbed and suppressed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah! I dare say you're right. Ah, I'm an ass!&#8221;</span> burst out Fyodor Pavlovitch, striking himself lightly on the forehead. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, your monastery may stand then, Alyosha, if that's how it is. And we clever people will sit snug and enjoy our brandy. You know, Ivan, it must have been so ordained by the Almighty Himself. Ivan, speak, is there a God or not? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing again?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now about Smerdyakov's belief in the existence of two saints who could move mountains.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, am I like him now, then?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg145"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, that shows I'm a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic. And you may be caught in the same way, though you are a philosopher. Shall I catch you? What do you bet that I'll catch you to-morrow. Speak, all the same, is there a God, or not? Only, be serious. I want you to be serious now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, there is no God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, is there a God?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a tiny bit?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is no immortality either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;None at all?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;None at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something? Anything is better than nothing!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Absolute nothingness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, is there immortality?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God and immortality?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God and immortality. In God is immortality.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;H'm! It's more likely Ivan's right. Good Lord! to think what faith, what force of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that dream, and for how many thousand years. Who is it laughing at man? Ivan! For the last time, once for all, is there a God or not? I ask for the last time!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And for the last time there is not.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who is laughing at mankind, Ivan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It must be the devil,&#8221;</span> said Ivan, smiling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And the devil? Does he exist?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, there's no devil either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's a pity. Damn it all, what wouldn't I do to the man who first invented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too good for him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There would have been no civilization if they hadn't invented God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Wouldn't there have been? Without God?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg146"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No. And there would have been no brandy either. But I must take your brandy away from you, anyway.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. I've hurt Alyosha's feelings. You're not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear little Alexey!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is better than your head.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My heart better than my head, is it? Oh, Lord! And that from you. Ivan, do you love Alyosha?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You must love him&#8221;</span> (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk). <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning. But I was excited. But there's wit in that elder, don't you think, Ivan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very likely.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is, there is. <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">Il y a du Piron l&#224;-dedans.</span></span> He's a Jesuit, a Russian one, that is. As he's an honorable person there's a hidden indignation boiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But, of course, he believes in God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not a bit of it. Didn't you know? Why, he tells every one so, himself. That is, not every one, but all the clever people who come to him. He said straight out to Governor Schultz not long ago: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;<span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span class="c19">Credo</span></span>, but I don't know in what.&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Really?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He really did. But I respect him. There's something of Mephistopheles about him, or rather of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;The hero of our time&#8217;</span> ... Arbenin, or what's his name?... You see, he's a sensualist. He's such a sensualist that I should be afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him. You know, when he begins telling stories.... The year before last he invited us to tea, tea with liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and began telling us about old times till we nearly split our sides.... Especially how he once cured a paralyzed woman. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;If my legs were not bad I know a dance I could dance you,&#8217;</span> he said. What do you say to that? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I've plenty of tricks in my time,&#8217;</span> said he. He did Dernidov, the merchant, out of sixty thousand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What, he stole it?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg147"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Take care of it for me, friend, there'll be a police search at my place to-morrow.&#8217;</span> And he kept it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You have given it to the Church,&#8217;</span> he declared. I said to him: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You're a scoundrel,&#8217;</span> I said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;No,&#8217;</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'm not a scoundrel, but I'm broad-minded.&#8217;</span> But that wasn't he, that was some one else. I've muddled him with some one else ... without noticing it. Come, another glass and that's enough. Take away the bottle, Ivan. I've been telling lies. Why didn't you stop me, Ivan, and tell me I was lying?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I knew you'd stop of yourself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me. You despise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own house.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, I'm going away. You've had too much brandy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've begged you for Christ's sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two, and you don't go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll go to-morrow if you're so set upon it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You won't go. You want to keep an eye on me. That's what you want, spiteful fellow. That's why you won't go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness when the drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to assert himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that? Your eyes look at me and say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You ugly drunkard!&#8217;</span> Your eyes are mistrustful. They're contemptuous.... You've come here with some design. Alyosha, here, looks at me and his eyes shine. Alyosha doesn't despise me. Alexey, you mustn't love Ivan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't be ill-tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking him,&#8221;</span> Alyosha said emphatically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy, Ivan. It's the third time I've told you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don't love me, but don't be angry all the same. You've nothing to love me for. You go to Tchermashnya. I'll come to you myself and bring you a present. I'll show you a little wench there. I've had my eye on her a long time. She's still running about bare-foot. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg148"></a> Don't be afraid of bare-footed wenches&#8212;don't despise them&#8212;they're pearls!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And he kissed his hand with a smack.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To my thinking,&#8221;</span> he revived at once, seeming to grow sober the instant he touched on his favorite topic. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To my thinking ... Ah, you boys! You children, little sucking-pigs, to my thinking ... I never thought a woman ugly in my life&#8212;that's been my rule! Can you understand that? How could you understand it? You've milk in your veins, not blood. You're not out of your shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find something devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn't find in any other. Only, one must know how to find it, that's the point! That's a talent! To my mind there are no ugly women. The very fact that she is a woman is half the battle ... but how could you understand that? Even in <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">vieilles filles</span></span>, even in them you may discover something that makes you simply wonder that men have been such fools as to let them grow old without noticing them. Bare-footed girls or unattractive ones, you must take by surprise. Didn't you know that? You must astound them till they're fascinated, upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with such a little slut. It's a jolly good thing that there always are and will be masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a little maid-of-all-work and her master, and you know, that's all that's needed for happiness. Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to surprise your mother, but in a different way. I paid no attention to her at all, but all at once, when the minute came, I'd be all devotion to her, crawl on my knees, kiss her feet, and I always, always&#8212;I remember it as though it were to-day&#8212;reduced her to that tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh. It was peculiar to her. I knew her attacks always used to begin like that. The next day she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh was not a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit. That's the great thing, to know how to take every one. Once Belyavsky&#8212;he was a handsome fellow, and rich&#8212;used to like to come here and hang about her&#8212;suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence. And she&#8212;such a mild sheep&#8212;why, I thought she would have knocked me down for that blow. How she set on me! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You're beaten, beaten now,&#8217;</span> she said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You've taken a blow from him. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg149"></a> You have been trying to sell me to him,&#8217;</span> she said.... <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;And how dared he strike you in my presence! Don't dare come near me again, never, never! Run at once, challenge him to a duel!&#8217;</span>... I took her to the monastery then to bring her to her senses. The holy Fathers prayed her back to reason. But I swear, by God, Alyosha, I never insulted the poor crazy girl! Only once, perhaps, in the first year; then she was very fond of praying. She used to keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used to turn me out of her room then. I'll knock that mysticism out of her, thought I! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Here,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I take it down. You believe it's miraculous, but here, I'll spit on it directly and nothing will happen to me for it!&#8217;</span>... When she saw it, good Lord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung her hands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all over and fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha, what's the matter?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun speaking about his mother, a change had gradually come over Alyosha's face. He flushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered. The old sot had gone spluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat exactly as his mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face in them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance to his mother particularly impressed the old man.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It's like her, exactly as she used to be then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth, that's what I used to do to her. He's upset about his mother, his mother,&#8221;</span> he muttered to Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she not?&#8221;</span> said Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old man shrank before his flashing eyes. But something very strange had happened, though only for a second; it seemed really to have escaped the old man's mind that Alyosha's mother actually was the mother of Ivan too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Your mother?&#8221;</span> he muttered, not understanding. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg150"></a> you mean? What mother are you talking about? Was she?... Why, damn it! of course she was yours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before. Excuse me, why, I was thinking, Ivan.... He he he!&#8221;</span> He stopped. A broad, drunken, half-senseless grin overspread his face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, there were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the room. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He'll kill me! He'll kill me! Don't let him get at me!&#8221;</span> he screamed, clinging to the skirt of Ivan's coat.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00026"><span class="c9">Chapter IX. The Sensualists</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had been struggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the entrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then she's there! She's hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's here!&#8221;</span> shouted Dmitri. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn't catch her. Where is she? Where is she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">That shout, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's here!&#8221;</span> produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg151"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hold him! Hold him!&#8221;</span> he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase&#8212;not an expensive one&#8212;on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At him!&#8221;</span> shouted the old man. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Help!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why do you run after him? He'll murder you outright,&#8221;</span> Ivan cried wrathfully at his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka's here. He said he saw her himself, running.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself. He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you've seen for yourself that she hasn't come,&#8221;</span> cried Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But she may have come by that other entrance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch's pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hold him!&#8221;</span> shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's been stealing money in my bedroom.&#8221;</span> And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Madman! You've killed him!&#8221;</span> cried Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Serve him right!&#8221;</span> shouted Dmitri breathlessly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I haven't killed him, I'll come again and kill him. You can't protect him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Dmitri! Go away at once!&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha commandingly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg152"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey! You tell me. It's only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane. I shouted, she ran away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I swear she's not been here, and no one expected her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I saw her.... So she must ... I'll find out at once where she is.... Good-by, Alexey! Not a word to &#198;sop about the money now. But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He sends his compliments to you!&#8217;</span> Compliments, his compliments! Just compliments and farewell! Describe the scene to her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in an arm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri's cries. He was still fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri looked at him with hatred as he went out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't repent shedding your blood!&#8221;</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Beware, old man, beware of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you, and disown you altogether.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He ran out of the room.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!&#8221;</span> the old man wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his finger.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, she's not here, you old lunatic!&#8221;</span> Ivan shouted at him angrily. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here, he's fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed, and put him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his head. Exhausted by the brandy, by his violent emotion, and the blows he had received, he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing-room. Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase, while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Shouldn't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed, too?&#8221;</span> Alyosha said to him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We'll look after him. My brother gave you a terrible blow&#8212;on the head.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's insulted me!&#8221;</span> Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;insulted&#8217;</span> his father, not only you,&#8221;</span> observed Ivan with a forced smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I used to wash him in his tub. He's insulted me,&#8221;</span> repeated Grigory.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Damn it all, if I hadn't pulled him away perhaps he'd have murdered him. It wouldn't take much to do for &#198;sop, would it?&#8221;</span> whispered Ivan to Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God forbid!&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why should He forbid?&#8221;</span> Ivan went on in the same whisper, with a malignant grimace. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One reptile will devour the other. And serve them both right, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha shuddered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course I won't let him be murdered as I didn't just now. Stay here, Alyosha, I'll go for a turn in the yard. My head's begun to ache.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha went to his father's bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the screen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering and meditating. All at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha,&#8221;</span> he whispered apprehensively, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;where's Ivan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the yard. He's got a headache. He's on the watch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood on the chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I'm afraid of Ivan. I'm more afraid of Ivan than the other. You're the only one I'm not afraid of....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he'll defend you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, and what of the other? He's run to Grushenka. My angel, tell me the truth, was she here just now or not?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She won't marry him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She won't. She won't. She won't. She won't on any account!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more comforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg154"></a> Alyosha's hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively glittered in his eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now,&#8221;</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I'll let you go back to the monastery.... I was joking this morning, don't be angry with me. My head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha, comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me the truth!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're still asking whether she has been here or not?&#8221;</span> Alyosha said sorrowfully.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, no, no. I believe you. I'll tell you what it is: you go to Grushenka yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her; see for yourself, which she means to choose, him or me. Eh? What? Can you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I see her I'll ask her,&#8221;</span> Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, she won't tell you,&#8221;</span> the old man interrupted, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;she's a rogue. She'll begin kissing you and say that it's you she wants. She's a deceitful, shameless hussy. You mustn't go to her, you mustn't!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, father, and it wouldn't be suitable, it wouldn't be right at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where was he sending you just now? He shouted <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Go&#8217;</span> as he ran away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To Katerina Ivanovna.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For money? To ask her for money?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No. Not for money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's no money; not a farthing. I'll settle down for the night, and think things over, and you can go. Perhaps you'll meet her.... Only be sure to come to me to-morrow in the morning. Be sure to. I have a word to say to you to-morrow. Will you come?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When you come, pretend you've come of your own accord to ask after me. Don't tell any one I told you to. Don't say a word to Ivan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall never forget it. I've a word to say to you to-morrow&#8212;but I must think about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And how do you feel now?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg155"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly well!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway. He was sitting writing something in pencil in his note-book. Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was conscious, and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,&#8221;</span> said Ivan cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall be at the Hohlakovs' to-morrow,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I may be at Katerina Ivanovna's, too, if I don't find her now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you're going to her now, anyway? For that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;compliments and farewell,&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span> said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part of what went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that he&#8212;well, in fact&#8212;takes his leave of her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother, how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri?&#8221;</span> exclaimed Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One can't tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out. That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at other men and decide which is worthy to live?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided in men's hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as for rights&#8212;who has not the right to wish?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not for another man's death?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What even if for another man's death? Why lie to oneself since all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what I said just now&#8212;that one reptile will devour the other? In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding &#198;sop's blood, murdering him, eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind. I don't think Dmitri is capable of it, either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thanks, if only for that,&#8221;</span> smiled Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Be sure, I should always defend him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case. Good-by till to-morrow. Don't condemn me, and don't look on me as a villain,&#8221;</span> he added with a smile.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg156"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him, and that he had certainly done this with some definite motive.</p>
