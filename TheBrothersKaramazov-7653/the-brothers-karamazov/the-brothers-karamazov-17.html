<p class="tei tei-p c3">Madame Hohlakov was again the first to meet Alyosha. She was flustered; something important had happened. Katerina Ivanovna's hysterics had ended in a fainting fit, and then <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;a terrible, awful weakness had followed, she lay with her eyes turned up and was delirious. Now she was in a fever. They had sent for Herzenstube; they had sent for the aunts. The aunts were already here, but Herzenstube had not yet come. They were all sitting in her room, waiting. She was unconscious now, and what if it turned to brain fever!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is serious, serious,&#8221;</span> she added at every word, as though nothing that had happened to her before had been serious. Alyosha listened with distress, and was beginning to describe his adventures, but she interrupted him at the first words. She had not time to listen. She begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her there.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Lise,&#8221;</span> she whispered almost in his ear, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Lise has greatly surprised me just now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me, too, and so my heart forgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon as you had gone, she began to be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to-day and yesterday, though she was not laughing at you, but only joking. But she was seriously sorry for it, almost ready to cry, so that I was quite surprised. She has never been really sorry for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it. And you know she is laughing at me every minute. But this time she was in earnest. She thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and don't take offense or be wounded by her if you can help it. I am never hard upon her, for she's such a clever little thing. Would you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg233"></a> believe it? She said just now that you were a friend of her childhood, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the greatest friend of her childhood&#8217;</span>&#8212;just think of that&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;greatest friend&#8217;</span>&#8212;and what about me? She has very strong feelings and memories, and, what's more, she uses these phrases, most unexpected words, which come out all of a sudden when you least expect them. She spoke lately about a pine-tree, for instance: there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her early childhood. Very likely it's standing there still; so there's no need to speak in the past tense. Pine-trees are not like people, Alexey Fyodorovitch, they don't change quickly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Mamma,&#8217;</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I remember this pine-tree as in a dream,&#8217;</span> only she said something so original about it that I can't repeat it. Besides, I've forgotten it. Well, good-by! I am so worried I feel I shall go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I've been out of my mind twice in my life. Go to Lise, cheer her up, as you always can so charmingly. Lise,&#8221;</span> she cried, going to her door, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;here I've brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch, whom you insulted so. He is not at all angry, I assure you; on the contrary, he is surprised that you could suppose so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">Merci, maman.</span></span> Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushed crimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as people always do in such cases, she began immediately talking of other things, as though they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she told me all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you know, although mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one thing to another ... I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him the money and how is that poor man getting on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The fact is I didn't give it to him, and it's a long story,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha, as though he, too, could think of nothing but his regret at having failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he, too, looked away, and that he, too, was trying to talk of other things.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but at the first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise's attention as well. He spoke with deep feeling, under <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg234"></a> the influence of the strong impression he had just received, and he succeeded in telling his story well and circumstantially. In old days in Moscow he had been fond of coming to Lise and describing to her what had just happened to him, what he had read, or what he remembered of his childhood. Sometimes they had made day-dreams and woven whole romances together&#8212;generally cheerful and amusing ones. Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old days in Moscow, two years before. Lise was extremely touched by his story. Alyosha described Ilusha with warm feeling. When he finished describing how the luckless man trampled on the money, Lise could not help clasping her hands and crying out:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So you didn't give him the money! So you let him run away! Oh, dear, you ought to have run after him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, Lise; it's better I didn't run after him,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, getting up from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How so? How is it better? Now they are without food and their case is hopeless?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to them. He'll take the money to-morrow. To-morrow he will be sure to take it,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, pacing up and down, pondering. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, Lise,&#8221;</span> he went on, stopping suddenly before her, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I made one blunder, but that, even that, is all for the best.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What blunder, and why is it for the best?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll tell you. He is a man of weak and timorous character; he has suffered so much and is very good-natured. I keep wondering why he took offense so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last minute, he did not know that he was going to trample on the notes. And I think now that there was a great deal to offend him ... and it could not have been otherwise in his position.... To begin with, he was sore at having been so glad of the money in my presence and not having concealed it from me. If he had been pleased, but not so much; if he had not shown it; if he had begun affecting scruples and difficulties, as other people do when they take money, he might still endure to take it. But he was too genuinely delighted, and that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he is a good and truthful man&#8212;that's the worst of the whole business. All the while he talked, his voice was so weak, so broken, he talked so fast, so fast, he kept laughing such a laugh, or perhaps he was crying&#8212;yes, I am sure <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg235"></a> he was crying, he was so delighted&#8212;and he talked about his daughters&#8212;and about the situation he could get in another town.... And when he had poured out his heart, he felt ashamed at having shown me his inmost soul like that. So he began to hate me at once. He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. What had made him feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and accepted me as a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and tried to intimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had begun embracing me; he kept touching me with his hands. This must have been how he came to feel it all so humiliating, and then I made that blunder, a very important one. I suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough to move to another town, we would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself would give him as much as he wanted out of my own money. That struck him all at once. Why, he thought, did I put myself forward to help him? You know, Lise, it's awfully hard for a man who has been injured, when other people look at him as though they were his benefactors.... I've heard that; Father Zossima told me so. I don't know how to put it, but I have often seen it myself. And I feel like that myself, too. And the worst of it was that though he did not know, up to the very last minute, that he would trample on the notes, he had a kind of presentiment of it, I am sure of that. That's just what made him so ecstatic, that he had that presentiment.... And though it's so dreadful, it's all for the best. In fact, I believe nothing better could have happened.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, why could nothing better have happened?&#8221;</span> cried Lise, looking with great surprise at Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Because if he had taken the money, in an hour after getting home, he would be crying with mortification, that's just what would have happened. And most likely he would have come to me early to-morrow, and perhaps have flung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did just now. But now he has gone home awfully proud and triumphant, though he knows he has <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;ruined himself.&#8217;</span> So now nothing could be easier than to make him accept the two hundred roubles by to-morrow, for he has already vindicated his honor, tossed away the money, and trampled it under foot.... He couldn't know when he did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow, and yet he is in terrible need of that money. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg236"></a> Though he is proud of himself now, yet even to-day he'll be thinking what a help he has lost. He will think of it more than ever at night, will dream of it, and by to-morrow morning he may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness. It's just then that I'll appear. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Here, you are a proud man,&#8217;</span> I shall say: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;you have shown it; but now take the money and forgive us!&#8217;</span> And then he will take it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And then he will take it!&#8221;</span> Lise clapped her hands.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, that's true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha, how do you know all this? So young and yet he knows what's in the heart.... I should never have worked it out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footing with us, in spite of his taking money from us,&#8221;</span> Alyosha went on in his excitement, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and not only on an equal, but even on a higher footing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;On a higher footing&#8217;</span> is charming, Alexey Fyodorovitch; but go on, go on!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You mean there isn't such an expression as <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;on a higher footing&#8217;</span>; but that doesn't matter because&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no, of course it doesn't matter. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear.... You know, I scarcely respected you till now&#8212;that is I respected you but on an equal footing; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher footing. Don't be angry, dear, at my joking,&#8221;</span> she put in at once, with strong feeling. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am absurd and small, but you, you! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Isn't there in all our analysis&#8212;I mean your analysis ... no, better call it ours&#8212;aren't we showing contempt for him, for that poor man&#8212;in analyzing his soul like this, as it were, from above, eh? In deciding so certainly that he will take the money?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, Lise, it's not contempt,&#8221;</span> Alyosha answered, as though he had prepared himself for the question. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was thinking of that on the way here. How can it be contempt when we are all like him, when we are all just the same as he is? For you know we are just the same, no better. If we are better, we should have been just the same in his place.... I don't know about you, Lise, but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his soul is not sordid; on the contrary, full of fine feeling.... No, Lise, I have no contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg237"></a> to care for most people exactly as one would for children, and for some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we would for the sick!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in myself. I am sometimes very impatient and at other times I don't see things. It's different with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, I don't believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I am!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am so glad you say so, Lise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are sometimes sort of formal.... And yet you are not a bit formal really. Go to the door, open it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,&#8221;</span> said Lise, in a nervous, hurried whisper.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> Lise went on, flushing redder and redder. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give me your hand&#8212;that's right. I have to make a great confession, I didn't write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,&#8221;</span> and she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatly ashamed of the confession.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, Lise, what a good thing!&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha joyfully. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Sure? Upon my word!&#8221;</span> She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of it, blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I kiss his hand and he says, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What a good thing!&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I should like to please you always, Lise, but I don't know how to do it,&#8221;</span> he muttered, blushing too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen me as his wife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in earnest. What a thing to say! Why, that's impertinence&#8212;that's what it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, was it wrong of me to feel sure?&#8221;</span> Alyosha asked, laughing suddenly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg238"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,&#8221;</span> cried Lise, looking tenderly and happily at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he stooped down and kissed her on her lips.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, what are you doing?&#8221;</span> cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly abashed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, forgive me if I shouldn't.... Perhaps I'm awfully stupid.... You said I was cold, so I kissed you.... But I see it was stupid.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Lise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And in that dress!&#8221;</span> she ejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly ceased laughing and became serious, almost stern.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that yet, and we shall have a long time to wait,&#8221;</span> she ended suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tell me rather why you who are so clever, so intellectual, so observant, choose a little idiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha, I am awfully happy, for I don't deserve you a bit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few days. If I go into the world, I must marry. I know that. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">He</span></em> told me to marry, too. Whom could I marry better than you&#8212;and who would have me except you? I have been thinking it over. In the first place, you've known me from a child and you've a great many qualities I haven't. You are more light-hearted than I am; above all, you are more innocent than I am. I have been brought into contact with many, many things already.... Ah, you don't know, but I, too, am a Karamazov. What does it matter if you do laugh and make jokes, and at me, too? Go on laughing. I am so glad you do. You laugh like a little child, but you think like a martyr.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Like a martyr? How?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, Lise, your question just now: whether we weren't showing contempt for that poor man by dissecting his soul&#8212;that was the question of a sufferer.... You see, I don't know how to express it, but any one who thinks of such questions is capable of suffering. Sitting in your invalid chair you must have thought over many things already.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?&#8221;</span> murmured Lise in a failing voice, weak with happiness. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg239"></a> Alyosha. What will you wear when you come out of the monastery? What sort of suit? Don't laugh, don't be angry, it's very, very important to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I haven't thought about the suit, Lise; but I'll wear whatever you like.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white piqu&#233; waistcoat, and a soft gray felt hat.... Tell me, did you believe that I didn't care for you when I said I didn't mean what I wrote?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I didn't believe it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, I knew that you&#8212;seemed to care for me, but I pretended to believe that you didn't care for me to make it&#8212;easier for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am awfully fond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my fortune. I decided I would ask you for my letter, and if you brought it out calmly and gave it to me (as might have been expected from you) it would mean that you did not love me at all, that you felt nothing, and were simply a stupid boy, good for nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left the letter at home and that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as not to give it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it, wasn't it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it was this morning, in this pocket. Here it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a distance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I told a lie if you like,&#8221;</span> Alyosha laughed, too. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I told a lie so as not to give you back the letter. It's very precious to me,&#8221;</span> he added suddenly, with strong feeling, and again he flushed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It always will be, and I won't give it up to any one!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Lise looked at him joyfully. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha,&#8221;</span> she murmured again, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;look at the door. Isn't mamma listening?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very well, Lise, I'll look; but wouldn't it be better not to look? Why suspect your mother of such meanness?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What meanness? As for her spying on her daughter, it's her <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg240"></a> right, it's not meanness!&#8221;</span> cried Lise, firing up. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You may be sure, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that when I am a mother, if I have a daughter like myself I shall certainly spy on her!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Really, Lise? That's not right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, my goodness! What has meanness to do with it? If she were listening to some ordinary worldly conversation, it would be meanness, but when her own daughter is shut up with a young man.... Listen, Alyosha, do you know I shall spy upon you as soon as we are married, and let me tell you I shall open all your letters and read them, so you may as well be prepared.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, of course, if so&#8212;&#8221;</span> muttered Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;only it's not right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, how contemptuous! Alyosha, dear, we won't quarrel the very first day. I'd better tell you the whole truth. Of course, it's very wrong to spy on people, and, of course, I am not right and you are, only I shall spy on you all the same.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do, then; you won't find out anything,&#8221;</span> laughed Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And, Alyosha, will you give in to me? We must decide that too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall be delighted to, Lise, and certain to, only not in the most important things. Even if you don't agree with me, I shall do my duty in the most important things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's right; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only in the most important matters, but in everything. And I am ready to vow to do so now&#8212;in everything, and for all my life!&#8221;</span> cried Lise fervently, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and I'll do it gladly, gladly! What's more, I'll swear never to spy on you, never once, never to read one of your letters. For you are right and I am not. And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy, I know that I won't do it since you consider it dishonorable. You are my conscience now.... Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad lately&#8212;both yesterday and to-day? I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble, but I see you have some special grief besides, some secret one, perhaps?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, Lise, I have a secret one, too,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha mournfully. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see you love me, since you guessed that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What grief? What about? Can you tell me?&#8221;</span> asked Lise with timid entreaty.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg241"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll tell you later, Lise&#8212;afterwards,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, confused. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now you wouldn't understand it perhaps&#8212;and perhaps I couldn't explain it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, my brothers too,&#8221;</span> murmured Alyosha, pondering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,&#8221;</span> said Lise suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My brothers are destroying themselves,&#8221;</span> he went on, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;my father, too. And they are destroying others with them. It's <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the primitive force of the Karamazovs,&#8217;</span> as Father Pa&#239;ssy said the other day, a crude, unbridled, earthly force. Does the spirit of God move above that force? Even that I don't know. I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov.... Me a monk, a monk! Am I a monk, Lise? You said just now that I was.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And perhaps I don't even believe in God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You don't believe? What is the matter?&#8221;</span> said Lise quietly and gently. But Alyosha did not answer. There was something too mysterious, too subjective in these last words of his, perhaps obscure to himself, but yet torturing him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, is going, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I am with him! And then I shall be left alone.... I shall come to you, Lise.... For the future we will be together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together, all our lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha kissed her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, now go. Christ be with you!&#8221;</span> and she made the sign of the cross over him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Make haste back to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">him</span></em> while he is alive. I see I've kept you cruelly. I'll pray to-day for him and you. Alyosha, we shall be happy! Shall we be happy, shall we?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I believe we shall, Lise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going out of the house without saying good-by to her. But no sooner had he opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him. From the first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to meet him.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg242"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish nonsense and ridiculous. I trust you won't dream&#8212;It's foolishness, nothing but foolishness!&#8221;</span> she said, attacking him at once.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only don't tell her that,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;or she will be upset, and that's bad for her now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state, because you didn't want to irritate her by contradiction?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said,&#8221;</span> Alyosha declared stoutly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the first place I shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take her away, you may be sure of that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But why?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's all so far off. We may have to wait another year and a half.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that's true, of course, and you'll have time to quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half. But I am so unhappy! Though it's such nonsense, it's a great blow to me. I feel like Famusov in the last scene of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Sorrow from Wit</span></span>. You are Tchatsky and she is Sofya, and, only fancy, I've run down to meet you on the stairs, and in the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase. I heard it all; I almost dropped. So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of late! It means love to the daughter but death to the mother. I might as well be in my grave at once. And a more serious matter still, what is this letter she has written? Show it me at once, at once!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, there's no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I must know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness. Her aunts are here; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs. Herzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I didn't know what to do for him. I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him. He was driven home in my carriage. And on the top of it all, you and this letter! It's true nothing can happen for a year and a half. In the name of all that's holy, in the name of your dying elder, show me that letter, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I'm her mother. Hold it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I won't show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg243"></a> wouldn't. I am coming to-morrow, and if you like, we can talk over many things, but now good-by!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c2">
<a id="toc79"></a> <a id="pdf80"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00040"><span class="c9">Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good-by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o'clock. Alyosha's whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha's mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Even if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won't have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer-house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer-house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer-house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Everything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer-house unseen. He did not want to be noticed. The woman of the house and Foma too, if he were here, might be loyal to his brother and obey his instructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha come <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg244"></a> into the garden, or might warn Dmitri that he was being sought and inquired for.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was no one in the summer-house. Alyosha sat down and began to wait. He looked round the summer-house, which somehow struck him as a great deal more ancient than before. Though the day was just as fine as yesterday, it seemed a wretched little place this time. There was a circle on the table, left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before. Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind, as they always do in a time of tedious waiting. He wondered, for instance, why he had sat down precisely in the same place as before, why not in the other seat. At last he felt very depressed&#8212;depressed by suspense and uncertainty. But he had not sat there more than a quarter of an hour, when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close. People were sitting, or had only just sat down, somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away. Alyosha suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the day before, he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among the bushes on the left, by the fence. The people must be sitting on it now. Who were they?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A man's voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto, accompanying himself on the guitar:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">With invincible force</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">I am bound to my dear.</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">O Lord, have mercy</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">On her and on me!</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">On her and on me!</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">On her and on me!</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The voice ceased. It was a lackey's tenor and a lackey's song. Another voice, a woman's, suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully, though with mincing affectation:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why haven't you been to see us for so long, Pavel Fyodorovitch? Why do you always look down upon us?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not at all,&#8221;</span> answered a man's voice politely, but with emphatic dignity. It was clear that the man had the best of the position, and that the woman was making advances. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I believe the man must be Smerdyakov,&#8221;</span> thought Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;from his voice. And <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg245"></a> the lady must be the daughter of the house here, who has come from Moscow, the one who wears the dress with a tail and goes to Marfa for soup.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme,&#8221;</span> the woman's voice continued. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why don't you go on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The man sang again:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">What do I care for royal wealth</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">If but my dear one be in health?</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Lord have mercy</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">On her and on me!</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">On her and on me!</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">On her and on me!</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was even better last time,&#8221;</span> observed the woman's voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You sang <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;If my darling be in health&#8217;</span>; it sounded more tender. I suppose you've forgotten to-day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Poetry is rubbish!&#8221;</span> said Smerdyakov curtly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So far as it's poetry, it's essential rubbish. Consider yourself, who ever talks in rhyme? And if we were all to talk in rhyme, even though it were decreed by government, we shouldn't say much, should we? Poetry is no good, Marya Kondratyevna.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How clever you are! How is it you've gone so deep into everything?&#8221;</span> The woman's voice was more and more insinuating.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I could have done better than that. I could have known more than that, if it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up. I would have shot a man in a duel if he called me names because I am descended from a filthy beggar and have no father. And they used to throw it in my teeth in Moscow. It had reached them from here, thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch. Grigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth, but I would have sanctioned their killing me before I was born that I might not have come into the world at all. They used to say in the market, and your mamma too, with great lack of delicacy, set off telling me that her hair was like a mat on her head, and that she was short of five foot by a wee bit. Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;a little bit,&#8217;</span> like every one else? She wanted to make it touching, a regular peasant's feeling. Can a Russian peasant be said to feel, in comparison with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg246"></a> an educated man? He can't be said to have feeling at all, in his ignorance. From my childhood up when I hear <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;a wee bit,&#8217;</span> I am ready to burst with rage. I hate all Russia, Marya Kondratyevna.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If you'd been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you wouldn't have talked like that, but would have drawn your saber to defend all Russia.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what's more, I should like to abolish all soldiers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's no need of defense. In 1812 there was a great invasion of Russia by Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the present one, and it would have been a good thing if they had conquered us. A clever nation would have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it. We should have had quite different institutions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are they so much better in their own country than we are? I wouldn't change a dandy I know of for three young Englishmen,&#8221;</span> observed Marya Kondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her words with a most languishing glance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's as one prefers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you are just like a foreigner&#8212;just like a most gentlemanly foreigner. I tell you that, though it makes me bashful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just alike in their vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel wears polished boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it. The Russian people want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday, though he is mad, and all his children.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be unruly. He is mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket, I would have left here long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in his behavior, in his mind, and in his poverty. He doesn't know how to do anything, and yet he is respected by every one. I may be only a soup-maker, but with luck I could open a caf&#233; restaurant in Petrovka, in Moscow, for my cookery is something special, and there's no one in Moscow, except the foreigners, whose cookery is anything special. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is a beggar, but if he were to challenge the son of the first count in the country, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg247"></a> he'd fight him. Though in what way is he better than I am? For he is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he has wasted without any need!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It must be lovely, a duel,&#8221;</span> Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young officers with pistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some lady. A perfect picture! Ah, if only girls were allowed to look on, I'd give anything to see one!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's all very well when you are firing at some one, but when he is firing straight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. You'd be glad to run away, Marya Kondratyevna.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You don't mean you would run away?&#8221;</span> But Smerdyakov did not deign to reply. After a moment's silence the guitar tinkled again, and he sang again in the same falsetto:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Whatever you may say,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">I shall go far away.</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Life will be bright and gay</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">In the city far away.</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">I shall not grieve,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">I shall not grieve at all,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">I don't intend to grieve at all.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Then something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed. They were silent. Alyosha got up and walked towards them. He found Smerdyakov dressed up and wearing polished boots, his hair pomaded, and perhaps curled. The guitar lay on the garden-seat. His companion was the daughter of the house, wearing a light-blue dress with a train two yards long. She was young and would not have been bad-looking, but that her face was so round and terribly freckled.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Will my brother Dmitri soon be back?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha with as much composure as he could.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? It's not as if I were his keeper,&#8221;</span> answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and superciliously.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg248"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I simply asked whether you do know?&#8221;</span> Alyosha explained.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know nothing of his whereabouts and don't want to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on in the house, and promised to let him know when Agrafena Alexandrovna comes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an hour ago?&#8221;</span> he asked, looking at Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went straight to the summer-house. I hope you'll forgive me,&#8221;</span> he added, addressing Marya Kondratyevna. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was in a hurry to find my brother.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!&#8221;</span> drawled Marya Kondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha's apology. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For Dmitri Fyodorovitch often goes to the summer-house in that way. We don't know he is here and he is sitting in the summer-house.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is now. Believe me, it's on business of great importance to him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He never tells us,&#8221;</span> lisped Marya Kondratyevna.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Though I used to come here as a friend,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov began again, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Dmitri Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even here by his incessant questions about the master. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What news?&#8217;</span> he'll ask. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What's going on in there now? Who's coming and going?&#8217;</span> and can't I tell him something more. Twice already he's threatened me with death.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;With death?&#8221;</span> Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you suppose he'd think much of that, with his temper, which you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday? He says if I let Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I'll be the first to suffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I were not even more afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police know. God only knows what he might not do!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;His honor said to him the other day, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll pound you in a mortar!&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span> added Marya Kondratyevna.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, if it's pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,&#8221;</span> observed Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I could meet him, I might speak to him about that too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, the only thing I can tell you is this,&#8221;</span> said Smerdyakov, as though thinking better of it; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am here as an old friend and neighbor, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg249"></a> and it would be odd if I didn't come. On the other hand, Ivan Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother's lodging in Lake Street, without a letter, but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the restaurant here, in the market-place. I went, but didn't find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o'clock. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He's been here, but he is quite gone,&#8217;</span> those were the very words of his landlady. It's as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at this moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you, for he'd kill me for nothing at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?&#8221;</span> repeated Alyosha quickly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The Metropolis tavern in the market-place?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The very same.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's quite likely,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha, much excited. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thank you, Smerdyakov; that's important. I'll go there at once.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't betray me,&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov called after him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no, I'll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don't be anxious.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But wait a minute, I'll open the gate to you,&#8221;</span> cried Marya Kondratyevna.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No; it's a short cut, I'll get over the fence again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran to the tavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monastic dress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call them down. But just as he reached the tavern, a window was flung open, and his brother Ivan called down to him from it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, can't you come up here to me? I shall be awfully grateful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be sure I can, only I don't quite know whether in this dress&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I'll run down to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg250"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was alone dining.</p>
