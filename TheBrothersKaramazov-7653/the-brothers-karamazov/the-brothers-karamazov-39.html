<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00071"><span class="c9">Chapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches Mitya</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Something utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He could never, even a minute before, have conceived that any one could behave like that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was worst of all, there was something humiliating in it, and on their side something <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;supercilious and scornful.&#8221;</span> It was nothing to take off his coat, but he was asked to undress further, or rather not asked but <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;commanded,&#8221;</span> he quite understood that. From pride and contempt he submitted without a word. Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be ready if force is required,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and perhaps for some other reason, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, must I take off my shirt, too?&#8221;</span> he asked sharply, but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and the cap; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They make no bones about it,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;they don't keep up the most elementary politeness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I ask you for the second time&#8212;need I take off my shirt or not?&#8221;</span> he said, still more sharply and irritably.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,&#8221;</span> Nikolay Parfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so it seemed to Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page544"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg544"></a> lawyers. There turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left side at the back, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff. There were bloodstains on the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover, in the presence of the peasant witnesses, passed his fingers along the collar, the cuffs, and all the seams of the coat and trousers, obviously looking for something&#8212;money, of course. He didn't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He treats me not as an officer but as a thief,&#8221;</span> Mitya muttered to himself. They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind the curtain, fussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitch's attention to the cap, which they were also fingering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You remember Gridyenko, the copying-clerk,&#8221;</span> observed the secretary. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Last summer he received the wages of the whole office, and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk. And where was it found? Why, in just such pipings in his cap. The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko's case perfectly, and so laid aside Mitya's cap, and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly examined later.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221;</span> cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing that the right cuff of Mitya's shirt was turned in, and covered with blood, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;excuse me, what's that, blood?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes,&#8221;</span> Mitya jerked out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after Grigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at Perhotin's.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You must take off your shirt, too. That's very important as material evidence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What, am I to stay naked?&#8221;</span> he shouted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile take off your socks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're not joking? Is that really necessary?&#8221;</span> Mitya's eyes flashed.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page545"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg545"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We are in no mood for joking,&#8221;</span> answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, if I must&#8212;&#8221;</span> muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed, he took off his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were clothed, while he was naked, and strange to say, when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence, and was almost ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them, and that now they had a perfect right to despise him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when one's the only one undressed and everybody is looking, it's degrading,&#8221;</span> he kept repeating to himself, again and again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's like a dream, I've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions.&#8221;</span> It was a misery to him to take off his socks. They were very dirty, and so were his underclothes, and now every one could see it. And what was worse, he disliked his feet. All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous. He particularly loathed the coarse, flat, crooked nail on the right one, and now they would all see it. Feeling intolerably ashamed made him, at once and intentionally, rougher. He pulled off his shirt, himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Would you like to look anywhere else if you're not ashamed to?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, there's no need to, at present.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, am I to stay naked like this?&#8221;</span> he added savagely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, that can't be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down here for a while. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed, and I ... I'll see to all this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">All the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the search was drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and the clothes were carried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too. Mitya was left alone with the peasants, who stood in silence, never taking their eyes off him. Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feet stuck out, and he couldn't pull the quilt over so as to cover them. Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;an insufferable time.&#8221;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He thinks of me as a puppy,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts him to see me naked!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and returned to him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page546"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg546"></a> Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes, brought in behind him by a peasant.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here are clothes for you,&#8221;</span> he observed airily, seeming well satisfied with the success of his mission. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt. Luckily he had them all in his trunk. You can keep your own socks and underclothes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya flew into a passion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I won't have other people's clothes!&#8221;</span> he shouted menacingly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;give me my own!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's impossible!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him that his clothes, being stained with blood, must be <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;included with the other material evidence,&#8221;</span> and that they <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;had not even the right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.&#8221;</span> Mitya at last understood this. He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself. He merely observed, as he put them on, that the clothes were much better than his old ones, and that he disliked <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;gaining by the change.&#8221;</span> The coat was, besides, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;ridiculously tight. Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov was only a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too long. But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Damn it all! I can hardly button it,&#8221;</span> Mitya grumbled. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Be so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn't ask for his clothes, and it's not my doing that they've dressed me up like a clown.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend you his clothes, but sorry about all this business,&#8221;</span> mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was asked to go back to the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;other room.&#8221;</span> Mitya went in, scowling with anger, and trying to avoid looking at any one. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page547"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg547"></a> Dressed in another man's clothes he felt himself disgraced, even in the eyes of the peasants, and of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face appeared, for some reason, in the doorway, and vanished immediately. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's come to look at me dressed up,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya. He sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurd nightmarish feeling, as though he were out of his mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That's all that's left for you,&#8221;</span> he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor. He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he disdained to speak to him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out on purpose to show every one how dirty they were&#8212;the scoundrel!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,&#8221;</span> observed Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya's question.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes,&#8221;</span> said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on something.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We've done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> Nikolay Parfenovitch went on, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but having received from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money found upon you, we are, at the present moment&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is the stone in your ring?&#8221;</span> Mitya interrupted suddenly, as though awakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch's right hand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ring?&#8221;</span> repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins in it, what stone is that?&#8221;</span> Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's a smoky topaz,&#8221;</span> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Would you like to look at it? I'll take it off ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, don't take it off,&#8221;</span> cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking up, and angry with himself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't take it off ... there's no need.... Damn it!... Gentlemen, you've sullied my heart! Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you, if I had really killed my father, that I would shuffle, lie, and hide myself? No, that's not like Dmitri Karamazov, that he couldn't do, and if I were guilty, I swear I shouldn't have waited for your coming, or for the sunrise as I meant at first, but should have killed myself before this, without waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page548"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg548"></a> couldn't have learnt so much in twenty years as I've found out in this accursed night!... And should I have been like this on this night, and at this moment, sitting with you, could I have talked like this, could I have moved like this, could I have looked at you and at the world like this, if I had really been the murderer of my father, when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night&#8212;not from fear&#8212;oh, not simply from fear of your punishment! The disgrace of it! And you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing and believe in nothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you another nasty thing I've done, another disgrace, even if that would save me from your accusation! No, better Siberia! The man who opened the door to my father and went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed him. Who was he? I'm racking my brains and can't think who. But I can tell you it was not Dmitri Karamazov, and that's all I can tell you, and that's enough, enough, leave me alone.... Exile me, punish me, but don't bother me any more. I'll say no more. Call your witnesses!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be absolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor watched him the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking, observed, as though it were the most ordinary thing, with the most frigid and composed air:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may as well inform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us, that has been given us by Grigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery, he clearly and emphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that when, on coming out to the steps, and hearing a noise in the garden, he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate which stood open, before he noticed you running, as you have told us already, in the dark from the open window where you saw your father, he, Grigory, glanced to the left, and, while noticing the open window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him, the door, standing wide open&#8212;that door which you have stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden. I will not conceal from you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must have run from that door, though, of course, he did not see <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page549"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg549"></a> you do so with his own eyes, since he only noticed you first some distance away in the garden, running towards the fence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</span> he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;it's a barefaced lie. He couldn't have seen the door open because it was shut. He's lying!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement. He does not waver. He adheres to it. We've cross-examined him several times.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Precisely. I have cross-examined him several times,&#8221;</span> Nikolay Parfenovitch confirmed warmly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's false, false! It's either an attempt to slander me, or the hallucination of a madman,&#8221;</span> Mitya still shouted. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's simply raving, from loss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it when he came to.... He's raving.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after his injuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden from the lodge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But it's false, it's false! It can't be so! He's slandering me from spite.... He couldn't have seen it ... I didn't come from the door,&#8221;</span> gasped Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him impressively:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Confront him with it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you recognize this object?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official envelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The envelope was empty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with open eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It ... it must be that envelope of my father's, the envelope that contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there's inscribed on it, allow me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;For my little chicken&#8217;</span> ... yes&#8212;three thousand!&#8221;</span> he shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;do you see, three thousand, do you see?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course, we see. But we didn't find the money in it. It was empty, and lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen, it's Smerdyakov!&#8221;</span> he shouted suddenly, at the top of his voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's he who's murdered him! He's robbed him! No <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page550"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg550"></a> one else knew where the old man hid the envelope. It's Smerdyakov, that's clear, now!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I never knew it. I've never seen it. This is the first time I've looked at it. I'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov.... He was the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn't know ...&#8221;</span> Mitya was completely breathless.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased father's pillow. You especially stated that it was under the pillow, so you must have known it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We've got it written down,&#8221;</span> confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nonsense! It's absurd! I'd no idea it was under the pillow. And perhaps it wasn't under the pillow at all.... It was just a chance guess that it was under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov say? Have you asked him where it was? What does Smerdyakov say? that's the chief point.... And I went out of my way to tell lies against myself.... I told you without thinking that it was under the pillow, and now you&#8212; Oh, you know how one says the wrong thing, without meaning it. No one knew but Smerdyakov, only Smerdyakov, and no one else.... He didn't even tell me where it was! But it's his doing, his doing; there's no doubt about it, he murdered him, that's as clear as daylight now,&#8221;</span> Mitya exclaimed more and more frantically, repeating himself incoherently, and growing more and more exasperated and excited. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You must understand that, and arrest him at once.... He must have killed him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious, that's clear now.... He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal, and without the signal father would never have opened the door....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you're again forgetting the circumstance,&#8221;</span> the prosecutor observed, still speaking with the same restraint, though with a note of triumph, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there, while you were in the garden....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The door, the door,&#8221;</span> muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless at the prosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were silent.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page551"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg551"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, the door!... It's a nightmare! God is against me!&#8221;</span> he exclaimed, staring before him in complete stupefaction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, you see,&#8221;</span> the prosecutor went on with dignity, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and you can judge for yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out, a fact which overwhelms you and us. On the other side your incomprehensible, persistent, and, so to speak, obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the money which was so suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hours earlier, on your own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles! In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are we to believe, and what can we depend upon? And don't accuse us of being <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;frigid, cynical, scoffing people,&#8217;</span> who are incapable of believing in the generous impulses of your heart.... Try to enter into our position ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very well!&#8221;</span> he exclaimed suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will tell you my secret. I'll tell you where I got the money!... I'll reveal my shame, that I may not have to blame myself or you hereafter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> put in Nikolay Parfenovitch, in a voice of almost pathetic delight, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that every sincere and complete confession on your part at this moment may, later on, have an immense influence in your favor, and may, indeed, moreover&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and he checked himself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard him.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00072"><span class="c9">Chapter VII. Mitya's Great Secret. Received With Hisses</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221;</span> he began, still in the same agitation, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I want to make a full confession: that money was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">my own</span></em>.&#8221;</span> The lawyers' faces lengthened. That was not at all what they expected.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</span> faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;when at five o'clock on the same day, from your own confession&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page552"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg552"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession! That's nothing to do with it now! That money was my own, my own, that is, stolen by me ... not mine, I mean, but stolen by me, and it was fifteen hundred roubles, and I had it on me all the time, all the time ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But where did you get it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I took it off my neck, gentlemen, off this very neck ... it was here, round my neck, sewn up in a rag, and I'd had it round my neck a long time, it's a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And from whom did you ... appropriate it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You mean, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;steal it&#8217;</span>? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider that I practically stole it, but, if you prefer, I <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;appropriated it.&#8217;</span> I consider I stole it. And last night I stole it finally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Last night? But you said that it's a month since you ... obtained it?...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don't be uneasy. I didn't steal it from my father, but from her. Let me tell you without interrupting. It's hard to do, you know. You see, a month ago, I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my betrothed. Do you know her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know you know her. She's a noble creature, noblest of the noble. But she has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long ... and hated me with good reason, good reason!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Katerina Ivanovna!&#8221;</span> Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder. The prosecutor, too, stared.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, don't take her name in vain! I'm a scoundrel to bring her into it. Yes, I've seen that she hated me ... a long while.... From the very first, even that evening at my lodging ... but enough, enough. You're unworthy even to know of that. No need of that at all.... I need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago, gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in Moscow (as though she couldn't have sent it off herself!) and I ... it was just at that fatal moment in my life when I ... well, in fact, when I'd just come to love another, her, she's sitting down below now, Grushenka. I carried her off here to Mokroe then, and wasted here in two days half that damned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page553"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg553"></a> three thousand, but the other half I kept on me. Well, I've kept that other half, that fifteen hundred, like a locket round my neck, but yesterday I undid it, and spent it. What's left of it, eight hundred roubles, is in your hands now, Nikolay Parfenovitch. That's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Excuse me. How's that? Why, when you were here a month ago you spent three thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one count it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, you told every one yourself that you'd spent exactly three thousand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town said so. And here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three thousand. Yet I didn't spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred. And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag. That's how it was, gentlemen. That's where I got that money yesterday....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is almost miraculous,&#8221;</span> murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Allow me to inquire,&#8221;</span> observed the prosecutor at last, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;have you informed any one whatever of this circumstance before, I mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I told no one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Absolutely no one. No one and nobody.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What was your reason for this reticence? What was your motive for making such a secret of it? To be more precise: You have told us at last your secret, in your words, so <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;disgraceful,&#8217;</span> though in reality&#8212;that is, of course, comparatively speaking&#8212;this action, that is, the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to some one else, and, of course, only for a time is, in my view at least, only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful, when one takes into consideration your character.... Even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable, still, discreditable is not <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;disgraceful.&#8217;</span>... Many people have already guessed, during this last month, about the three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna's, that you have spent, and I heard the legend myself, apart from your confession.... Mihail Makarovitch, for instance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, but the gossip <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page554"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg554"></a> of the whole town. There are indications, too, if I am not mistaken, that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna's, and so, it's extremely surprising to me that hitherto, that is, up to the present moment, you have made such an extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by, apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret.... It's not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret.... You cried out, just now, that Siberia would be better than confessing it ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not conceal his vexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all his accumulated spleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without choosing words.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's not the fifteen hundred that's the disgrace, but that I put it apart from the rest of the three thousand,&#8221;</span> said Mitya firmly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why?&#8221;</span> smiled the prosecutor irritably. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is there disgraceful, to your thinking, in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had discreditably, if you prefer, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;disgracefully,&#8217;</span> appropriated? Your taking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it. And by the way, why did you do that&#8212;why did you set apart that half, for what purpose, for what object did you do it? Can you explain that to us?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I put it aside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on a whole month.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's incomprehensible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wonder at you. But I'll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is incomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate three thousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I spend it all, and next morning I go to her and say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Katya, I've done wrong, I've squandered your three thousand,&#8217;</span> well, is that right? No, it's not right&#8212;it's dishonest and cowardly, I'm a beast, with no more self-control than a beast, that's so, isn't it? But still I'm not a thief? Not a downright thief, you'll admit! I squandered it, but I didn't steal it. Now a second, rather more favorable alternative: follow me carefully, or I may get confused again&#8212;my head's going round&#8212;and so, for the second alternative: I spend here only fifteen <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page555"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg555"></a> hundred out of the three thousand, that is, only half. Next day I go and take that half to her: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Katya, take this fifteen hundred from me, I'm a low beast, and an untrustworthy scoundrel, for I've wasted half the money, and I shall waste this, too, so keep me from temptation!&#8217;</span> Well, what of that alternative? I should be a beast and a scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a thief, not altogether a thief, or I should not have brought back what was left, but have kept that, too. She would see at once that since I brought back half, I should pay back what I'd spent, that I should never give up trying to, that I should work to get it and pay it back. So in that case I should be a scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I admit that there is a certain distinction,&#8221;</span> said the prosecutor, with a cold smile. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But it's strange that you see such a vital difference.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel, and perhaps every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a thief, it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don't know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel, that's my conviction. Listen, I carry the money about me a whole month, I may make up my mind to give it back to-morrow, and I'm a scoundrel no longer, but I cannot make up my mind, you see, though I'm making up my mind every day, and every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month I can't bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking, is that right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Certainly, that's not right, that I can quite understand, and that I don't dispute,&#8221;</span> answered the prosecutor with reserve. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And let us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if you will be so kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that you have still not told us, altogether we've asked you, why, in the first place, you halved the money, squandering one half and hiding the other? For what purpose exactly did you hide it, what did you mean to do with that fifteen hundred? I insist upon that question, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, of course!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;forgive me, I'm worrying you, and am not explaining the chief point, or you'd understand in a minute, for it's just the motive of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page556"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg556"></a> it that's the disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man, my dead father. He was always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna, and I was jealous; I thought then that she was hesitating between me and him. So I kept thinking every day, suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden, suppose she were to leave off tormenting me, and were suddenly to say to me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I love you, not him; take me to the other end of the world.&#8217;</span> And I'd only forty copecks; how could I take her away, what could I do? Why, I'd be lost. You see, I didn't know her then, I didn't understand her, I thought she wanted money, and that she wouldn't forgive my poverty. And so I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it up, calculating on it, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had sewn it up, I went off to get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base. Do you understand now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Both the lawyers laughed aloud.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have squandered it all,&#8221;</span> chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for after all what does it amount to?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, that I stole it, that's what it amounts to! Oh, God, you horrify me by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up round my neck, every day and every hour I said to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You're a thief! you're a thief!&#8217;</span> Yes, that's why I've been so savage all this month, that's why I fought in the tavern, that's why I attacked my father, it was because I felt I was a thief. I couldn't make up my mind, I didn't dare even to tell Alyosha, my brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried it I said to myself at the same time every hour: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you may yet not be a thief.&#8217;</span> Why? Because I might go next day and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck, on my way from Fenya's to Perhotin. I hadn't been able till that moment to bring myself to it. And it was only when I tore it off that I became a downright thief, a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life. Why? Because, with that I destroyed, too, my dream of going to Katya and saying, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'm a scoundrel, but not a thief!&#8217;</span> Do you understand now? Do you understand?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page557"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg557"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?&#8221;</span> Nikolay Parfenovitch interrupted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why? It's absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to die at five o'clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see it's not so, it turns out that it does make a difference. Believe me, gentlemen, what has tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I'd killed the old servant, and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded, and Heaven was open to me again. Oh, that did torture me, but not in the same way: not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last and spent it, and had become a downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell you again, with a bleeding heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. I have learnt that it's not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but impossible to die a scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in spite of his being intensely excited.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> the prosecutor said slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But all this, if you'll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves, in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves, that's what it is. And why, for instance, should you not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month, by going and returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you? And why could you not have explained things to her, and in view of your position, which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one's mind, that is, after honorably confessing your errors to her, why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses, which, with her generous heart, she would certainly not have refused you in your distress, especially if it had been with some guarantee, or even on the security you offered to the merchant Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I suppose you still regard that security as of value?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya suddenly crimsoned.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Surely you don't think me such an out and out scoundrel as that? You can't be speaking in earnest?&#8221;</span> he said, with indignation, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page558"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg558"></a> looking the prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to believe his ears.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I assure you I'm in earnest.... Why do you imagine I'm not serious?&#8221;</span> It was the prosecutor's turn to be surprised.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you are torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I'll confess all my infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and you'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions can sink. You must know that I already had that plan myself, that plan you spoke of, just now, prosecutor! Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that thought in my mind all this current month, so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya&#8212;I was mean enough for that. But to go to her, to tell her of my treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out, for the expenses of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (to beg, do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away with the other, the rival, who hated and insulted her&#8212;to think of it! You must be mad, prosecutor!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ... of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case, as you assert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,&#8221;</span> said the prosecutor, smiling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But that would have been so infamous!&#8221;</span> Mitya brought his fist down on the table fiercely. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That would have been filthy beyond everything! Yes, do you know that she might have given me that money, yes, and she would have given it, too; she'd have been certain to give it, to be revenged on me, she'd have given it to satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me, for hers is an infernal nature, too, and she's a woman of great wrath. I'd have taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have taken it, and then, for the rest of my life ... oh, God! Forgive me, gentlemen, I'm making such an outcry because I've had that thought in my mind so lately, only the day before yesterday, that night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards yesterday, all day yesterday, I remember, till that happened ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Till what happened?&#8221;</span> put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively, but Mitya did not hear it.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page559"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg559"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have made you an awful confession,&#8221;</span> Mitya said gloomily in conclusion. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You must appreciate it, and what's more, you must respect it, for if not, if that leaves your souls untouched, then you've simply no respect for me, gentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die of shame at having confessed it to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot myself! Yes, I see, I see already that you don't believe me. What, you want to write that down, too?&#8221;</span> he cried in dismay.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, what you said just now,&#8221;</span> said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking at him in surprise, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that is, that up to the last hour you were still contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her.... I assure you, that's a very important piece of evidence for us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you, particularly important for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have mercy, gentlemen!&#8221;</span> Mitya flung up his hands. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't write that, anyway; have some shame. Here I've torn my heart asunder before you, and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves.... Oh, my God!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In despair he hid his face in his hands.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> observed the prosecutor, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards, and what you don't agree to we'll alter as you like. But now I'll ask you one little question for the second time. Has no one, absolutely no one, heard from you of that money you sewed up? That, I must tell you, is almost impossible to believe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No one, no one, I told you so before, or you've not understood anything! Let me alone!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there's plenty of time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you'd spent here; three thousand, not fifteen hundred. And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">all</span></em> means something.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what need had you to <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;talk rot,&#8217;</span> as you call it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much money.... To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps ... yes, that was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question? Well, I told a fib, and that was the end of it, once I'd said it, I didn't care to correct it. What does a man tell lies for sometimes?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes a man tell lies,&#8221;</span> observed the prosecutor impressively. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tell me, though, was that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;amulet,&#8217;</span> as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, not big.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How big, for instance?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the size.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You'd better show us the remains of it. You must have them somewhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Damnation, what nonsense! I don't know where they are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck? According to your own evidence you didn't go home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When I was going from Fenya's to Perhotin's, on the way I tore it off my neck and took out the money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the dark?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in one minute.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Without scissors, in the street?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the market-place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an old rag. It was torn in a minute.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where did you put it afterwards?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I dropped it there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where was it, exactly?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the market-place, in the market-place! The devil knows whereabouts. What do you want to know for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would be material evidence in your favor. How is it you don't understand that? Who helped you to sew it up a month ago?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No one helped me. I did it myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page561"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg561"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can you sew?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed to do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you sewed the money?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you laughing at me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know where I got the rag from&#8212;somewhere, I suppose.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I should have thought you couldn't have forgotten it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Upon my word, I don't remember. I might have torn a bit off my linen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to-morrow the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag. What sort of rag was it, cloth or linen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe I didn't tear it off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe I sewed it up in a cap of my landlady's.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In your landlady's cap?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. I took it from her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How did you get it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to wipe my pen on. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless rag. I tore it up, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it. I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them. An old piece of calico, washed a thousand times.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you remember that for certain now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap. But, hang it, what does it matter?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, she won't, she didn't miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you, an old rag not worth a farthing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And where did you get the needle and thread?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll stop now. I won't say any more. Enough of it!&#8221;</span> said Mitya, losing his temper at last.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw the pieces in the market-place.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page562"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg562"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and perhaps you'll find it,&#8221;</span> said Mitya, sneering. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Enough, gentlemen, enough!&#8221;</span> he decided, in an exhausted voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see you don't believe me! Not for a moment! It's my fault, not yours. I ought not to have been so ready. Why, why did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you? It's a joke to you. I see that from your eyes. You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing a hymn of triumph if you can.... Damn you, you torturers!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were silent. A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost vacantly. His face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was happening. In the meantime they had to finish what they were about. They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses. It was by now eight o'clock in the morning. The lights had been extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had been continually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation had been going on, had now both gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked very tired. It was a wretched morning, the whole sky was overcast, and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;May I look out of the window?&#8221;</span> he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, as much as you like,&#8221;</span> the latter replied.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed against its little greenish panes. He could see the muddy road just below the house, and farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of poor, black, dismal huts, looking even blacker and poorer in the rain. Mitya thought of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ph&#339;bus the golden-haired,&#8221;</span> and how he had meant to shoot himself at his first ray. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps it would be even better on a morning like this,&#8221;</span> he thought with a smile, and suddenly, flinging his hand downwards, he turned to his <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;torturers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221;</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me about her, I beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me? She's innocent, you know, she was out of her mind when she cried last night <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's all my fault!&#8217;</span> She's done nothing, nothing! I've been grieving over her all night as I sat with you.... Can't you, won't you tell me what you are going to do with her now?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page563"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg563"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> the prosecutor answered at once, with evident alacrity. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We have, so far, no grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you are so interested. I trust that it may be the same in the later development of the case.... On the contrary, we'll do everything that lies in our power in that matter. Set your mind completely at rest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight-forward people in spite of everything. You've taken a load off my heart.... Well, what are we to do now? I'm ready.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the witnesses without delay. That must be done in your presence and therefore&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Shouldn't we have some tea first?&#8221;</span> interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I think we've deserved it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch had, no doubt, gone down to get some) they would have a glass and then <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;go on and on,&#8221;</span> putting off their proper breakfast until a more favorable opportunity. Tea really was ready below, and was soon brought up. Mitya at first refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him, but afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily. He looked surprisingly exhausted. It might have been supposed from his Herculean strength that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent emotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he could hardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the objects about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A little more and I shall begin raving,&#8221;</span> he said to himself.</p>
