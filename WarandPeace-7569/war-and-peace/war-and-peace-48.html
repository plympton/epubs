<h2 id="dlepubid00253">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the Rostovs' house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up, others still empty.</p>
<p>The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head. Petya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army. Sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. Natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.</p>
<p>Natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside Sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was done and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.</p>
<p>"Dunyasha, you pack! You will, won't you, dear?" And when Dunyasha willingly promised to do it all for her, Natasha sat down on the floor, took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Natasha got up and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the street.</p>
<p>The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen, postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.</p>
<p>Natasha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.</p>
<p>The former housekeeper, old Mavra Kuzminichna, had stepped out of the crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside. Natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.</p>
<p>"Then you have nobody in Moscow?" she was saying. "You would be more comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family are leaving."</p>
<p>"I don't know if it would be allowed," replied the officer in a weak voice. "Here is our commanding officer... ask him," and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.</p>
<p>Natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to meet the major.</p>
<p>"May the wounded men stay in our house?" she asked.</p>
<p>The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.</p>
<p>"Which one do you want, Ma'am'selle?" said he, screwing up his eyes and smiling.</p>
<p>Natasha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection&#8212;as if considering in how far the thing was possible&#8212;replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, why not? They may," he said.</p>
<p>With a slight inclination of her head, Natasha stepped back quickly to Mavra Kuzminichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.</p>
<p>"They may. He says they may!" whispered Natasha.</p>
<p>The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostovs' yard, and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in Povarskaya Street. Natasha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and Mavra Kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard.</p>
<p>"Your Papa must be told, though," said Mavra Kuzminichna.</p>
<p>"Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house."</p>
<p>"There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we put them into the wing, the men's room, or the nurse's room, we must ask permission."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll ask."</p>
<p>Natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door into the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman's drops.</p>
<p>"Are you asleep, Mamma?"</p>
<p>"Oh, what sleep-?" said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping into a doze.</p>
<p>"Mamma darling!" said Natasha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her face close to her mother's, "I am sorry, forgive me, I'll never do it again; I woke you up! Mavra Kuzminichna has sent me: they have brought some wounded here&#8212;officers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere to go. I knew you'd let them come!" she said quickly all in one breath.</p>
<p>"What officers? Whom have they brought? I don't understand anything about it," said the countess.</p>
<p>Natasha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"I knew you'd give permission... so I'll tell them," and, having kissed her mother, Natasha got up and went to the door.</p>
<p>In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.</p>
<p>"We've stayed too long!" said the count with involuntary vexation. "The club is closed and the police are leaving."</p>
<p>"Papa, is it all right&#8212;I've invited some of the wounded into the house?" said Natasha.</p>
<p>"Of course it is," he answered absently. "That's not the point. I beg you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we must go, go, go!...."</p>
<p>And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.</p>
<p>At dinner Petya having returned home told them the news he had heard. He said the people had been getting arms in the Kremlin, and that though Rostopchin's broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big battle there.</p>
<p>The countess looked with timid horror at her son's eager, excited face as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the fatherland&#8212;something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so, hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Petya with her as their protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly, that very night if possible. With a woman's involuntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00254">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the countess' fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealer's in Myasnitski Street. When returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink store, having received orders to do so.</p>
<p>After dinner the whole Rostov household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people, and flurrying them still more. Petya directed things in the yard. Sonya, owing to the count's contradictory orders, lost her head and did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing. Natasha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her. Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natasha set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much china standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.</p>
<p>"Sonya, wait a bit&#8212;we'll pack everything into these," said Natasha.</p>
<p>"You can't, Miss, we have tried to," said the butler's assistant.</p>
<p>"No, wait a minute, please."</p>
<p>And Natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper.</p>
<p>"The dishes must go in here among the carpets," said she.</p>
<p>"Why, it's a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases," said the butler's assistant.</p>
<p>"Oh, wait, please!" And Natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the things. "These aren't needed," said she, putting aside some plates of Kiev ware. "These&#8212;yes, these must go among the carpets," she said, referring to the Saxony china dishes.</p>
<p>"Don't, Natasha! Leave it alone! We'll get it all packed," urged Sonya reproachfully.</p>
<p>"What a young lady she is!" remarked the major-domo.</p>
<p>But Natasha would not give in. She turned everything out and began quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few more things might have been taken out, but Natasha insisted on having her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler's assistant and Petya&#8212;whom she had drawn into the business of packing&#8212;press on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself.</p>
<p>"That's enough, Natasha," said Sonya. "I see you were right, but just take out the top one."</p>
<p>"I won't!" cried Natasha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the carpets. "Now press, Petya! Press, Vasilich, press hard!" she cried.</p>
<p>The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natasha, clapping her hands, screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that Natasha had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might be corded up. Thanks to Natasha's directions the work now went on expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible.</p>
<p>But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count, having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.</p>
<p>Sonya and Natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing.</p>
<p>That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskaya, and Mavra Kuzminichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the Rostovs' yard. Mavra Kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important man. He was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood, and was quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart.</p>
<p>"Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house will be empty," said the old woman to the old attendant.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps," said he with a sigh. "We don't expect to get him home alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it's a long way from here, and there's nobody living in it."</p>
<p>"Do us the honor to come in, there's plenty of everything in the master's house. Come in," said Mavra Kuzminichna. "Is he very ill?" she asked.</p>
<p>The attendant made a hopeless gesture.</p>
<p>"We don't expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor."</p>
<p>And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.</p>
<p>"All right!" said the doctor.</p>
<p>The old servant returned to the caleche, looked into it, shook his head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped beside Mavra Kuzminichna.</p>
<p>"O, Lord Jesus Christ!" she murmured.</p>
<p>She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.</p>
<p>"The masters won't object..." she said.</p>
<p>But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss'.</p>
<p>This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkonski.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00255">CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>Moscow's last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.</p>
<p>Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscow&#8212;the rabble, that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials, seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to the Three Hills. Having waited there for Rostopchin who did not turn up, they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being given away for nothing.</p>
<p>In the Rostovs' staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the Rostovs' and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rostovs' and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and one's own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one's own family. So thought the major-domo on his master's behalf.</p>
<p>On waking up that morning Count Ilya Rostov left his bedroom softly, so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning, and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch. The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.</p>
<p>"Well, Vasilich, is everything ready?" asked the count, and stroking his bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)</p>
<p>"We can harness at once, your excellency."</p>
<p>"Well, that's right. As soon as the countess wakes we'll be off, God willing! What is it, gentlemen?" he added, turning to the officer. "Are you staying in my house?"</p>
<p>The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.</p>
<p>"Count, be so good as to allow me... for God's sake, to get into some corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be all right on a loaded cart..."</p>
<p>Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on behalf of his master.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes, yes!" said the count hastily. "I shall be very pleased, very pleased. Vasilich, you'll see to it. Just unload one or two carts. Well, what of it... do what's necessary..." said the count, muttering some indefinite order.</p>
<p>But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer's face had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and moving toward the porch.</p>
<p>"Please step into the gallery, your excellency," said the major-domo. "What are your orders about the pictures?"</p>
<p>The count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.</p>
<p>"Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded," he added in a soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock the countess woke up, and Matrena Timofeevna, who had been her lady's maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief gendarme's duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much offended and the young ladies' summer dresses could not be left behind. On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them. The countess sent for her husband.</p>
<p>"What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded."</p>
<p>"You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to them!... Really now, in our own yard&#8212;we asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them be taken... where's the hurry?"</p>
<p>The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the children's interests, such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.</p>
<p>She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband: "Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our&#8212;all the children's property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand rubles' worth of things in the house. I don't consent, my dear, I don't! Do as you please! It's the government's business to look after the wounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukhins opposite, they cleared out everything two days ago. That's what other people do. It's only we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the children."</p>
<p>Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying.</p>
<p>"Papa, what are you doing that for?" asked Natasha, who had followed him into her mother's room.</p>
<p>"Nothing! What business is it of yours?" muttered the count angrily.</p>
<p>"But I heard," said Natasha. "Why does Mamma object?"</p>
<p>"What business is it of yours?" cried the count.</p>
<p>Natasha stepped up to the window and pondered.</p>
<p>"Papa! Here's Berg coming to see us," said she, looking out of the window.</p>
<p><a id="link2HCH0245"><!--  H2 anchor --></a></p>
<div class="c3">
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
</div>
<h2 id="dlepubid00256">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>Berg, the Rostovs' son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders of Vladimir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army.</p>
<p>On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.</p>
<p>He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there. So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons.</p>
<p>Berg drove up to his father-in-law's house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.</p>
<p>From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Natasha and Sonya, and hastened to inquire after "Mamma's" health.</p>
<p>"Health, at a time like this?" said the count. "Come, tell us the news! Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?"</p>
<p>"God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa," said Berg. "The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly antique valor of the Russian army, which they&#8212;which it" (he corrected himself) "has shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth&#8212;there are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa" (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words "Russian army"), "I tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor," he went on rapidly. "General Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a hillside. You can imagine!"</p>
<p>And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days. Natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question.</p>
<p>"Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors cannot be imagined or adequately praised!" said Berg, glancing round at Natasha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent look with a smile. "'Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of her sons!' Isn't it so, Papa?" said he.</p>
<p>Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand, asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy, remained standing beside her.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get away...."</p>
<p>"I can't think what the servants are about," said the countess, turning to her husband. "I have just been told that nothing is ready yet. Somebody after all must see to things. One misses Mitenka at such times. There won't be any end to it."</p>
<p>The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself. He got up from his chair and went to the door.</p>
<p>At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and significantly.</p>
<p>"And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa," said he.</p>
<p>"Hm..." said the count, and stopped.</p>
<p>"I was driving past Yusupov's house just now," said Berg with a laugh, "when the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldn't buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear Vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it." (At the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) "And it's such a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know! And dear Vera has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you see. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me have one, I will pay the man well, and..."</p>
<p>The count frowned and coughed.</p>
<p>"Ask the countess, I don't give orders."</p>
<p>"If it's inconvenient, please don't," said Berg. "Only I so wanted it, for dear Vera's sake."</p>
<p>"Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil..." cried the old count. "My head's in a whirl!"</p>
<p>And he left the room. The countess began to cry.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!" said Berg.</p>
<p>Natasha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Petya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly.</p>
<p>"Do you know what it's about?" Petya asked Natasha.</p>
<p>She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about. She did not answer.</p>
<p>"It's because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded," said Petya. "Vasilich told me. I consider..."</p>
<p>"I consider," Natasha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to Petya, "I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I don't know what. Are we despicable Germans?"</p>
<p>Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs.</p>
<p>Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down the room, when Natasha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.</p>
<p>"It's horrid! It's abominable!" she screamed. "You can't possibly have ordered it!"</p>
<p>Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count stood still at the window and listened.</p>
<p>"Mamma, it's impossible: see what is going on in the yard!" she cried. "They will be left!..."</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you? Who are 'they'? What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Why, the wounded! It's impossible, Mamma. It's monstrous!... No, Mamma darling, it's not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the yard... Mamma!... It's impossible!"</p>
<p>The count stood by the window and listened without turning round. Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.</p>
<p>The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.</p>
<p>"Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?" she said, not surrendering at once.</p>
<p>"Mamma, darling, forgive me!"</p>
<p>But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.</p>
<p>"My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don't understand about it," said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.</p>
<p>"The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen," muttered the count through tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of shame on his breast.</p>
<p>"Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?..." asked Natasha. "We will still take all the most necessary things."</p>
<p>The count nodded affirmatively, and Natasha, at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard.</p>
<p>The servants gathered round Natasha, but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself, in his wife's name, confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do.</p>
<p>The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the Rostovs' yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart.</p>
<p>"We can take four more men," said the steward. "They can have my trap, or else what is to become of them?"</p>
<p>"Let them have my wardrobe cart," said the countess. "Dunyasha can go with me in the carriage."</p>
<p>They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright and animated. Natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time.</p>
<p>"What could we fasten this onto?" asked the servants, trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. "We must keep at least one cart."</p>
<p>"What's in it?" asked Natasha.</p>
<p>"The count's books."</p>
<p>"Leave it, Vasilich will put it away. It's not wanted."</p>
<p>The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count Peter could sit.</p>
<p>"On the box. You'll sit on the box, won't you, Petya?" cried Natasha.</p>
<p>Sonya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite different from Natasha's. She was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00257">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>Before two o'clock in the afternoon the Rostovs' four carriages, packed full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.</p>
<p>The caleche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sonya's attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance.</p>
<p>"Whose caleche is that?" she inquired, leaning out of the carriage window.</p>
<p>"Why, didn't you know, Miss?" replied the maid. "The wounded prince: he spent the night in our house and is going with us."</p>
<p>"But who is it? What's his name?"</p>
<p>"It's our intended that was&#8212;Prince Bolkonski himself! They say he is dying," replied the maid with a sigh.</p>
<p>Sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess, tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting. Natasha was not in the room.</p>
<p>"Mamma," said Sonya, "Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is going with us."</p>
<p>The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya's arm, glanced around.</p>
<p>"Natasha?" she murmured.</p>
<p>At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them. They knew their Natasha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.</p>
<p>"Natasha does not know yet, but he is going with us," said Sonya.</p>
<p>"You say he is dying?"</p>
<p>Sonya nodded.</p>
<p>The countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry.</p>
<p>"The ways of God are past finding out!" she thought, feeling that the Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was now taking place.</p>
<p>"Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What's the matter?" asked Natasha, as with animated face she ran into the room.</p>
<p>"Nothing," answered the countess. "If everything is ready let us start."</p>
<p>And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. Sonya embraced Natasha and kissed her.</p>
<p>Natasha looked at her inquiringly.</p>
<p>"What is it? What has happened?"</p>
<p>"Nothing... No..."</p>
<p>"Is it something very bad for me? What is it?" persisted Natasha with her quick intuition.</p>
<p>Sonya sighed and made no reply. The count, Petya, Madame Schoss, Mavra Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came into the drawing room and, having closed the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another.</p>
<p>The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The countess went into the oratory and there Sonya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall. (The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected, were being taken with them.)</p>
<p>In the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed with swords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.</p>
<p>As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages, the caleche, the phaeton, and back again.</p>
<p>"They always will forget everything!" said the countess. "Don't you know I can't sit like that?"</p>
<p>And Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat.</p>
<p>"Oh, those servants!" said the count, swaying his head.</p>
<p>Efim, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years' experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order, "Be off, in God's name!" would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill. He knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, with more patience than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. At last all were seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say. Then Efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself. The postilion and all the other servants did the same. "Off, in God's name!" said Efim, putting on his hat. "Start!" The postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted in their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In the carriages, the caleche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.</p>
<p>Rarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of Prince Andrew's caleche. She did not know who was in it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that caleche. She knew it was right in front.</p>
<p>In Kudrino, from the Nikitski, Presnya, and Podnovinsk Streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostovs', and as they passed along the Sadovaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast.</p>
<p>As they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha, who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:</p>
<p>"Dear me! Mamma, Sonya, look, it's he!"</p>
<p>"Who? Who?"</p>
<p>"Look! Yes, on my word, it's Bezukhov!" said Natasha, putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman's long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man in a frieze coat.</p>
<p>"Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman's coat, with a queer-looking old boy. Really," said Natasha, "look, look!"</p>
<p>"No, it's not he. How can you talk such nonsense?"</p>
<p>"Mamma," screamed Natasha, "I'll stake my head it's he! I assure you! Stop, stop!" she cried to the coachman.</p>
<p>But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchanski Street came more carts and carriages, and the Rostovs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way.</p>
<p>In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rostovs all saw Pierre&#8212;or someone extraordinarily like him&#8212;in a coachman's coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully touching Pierre's elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated, he recognized Natasha, and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.</p>
<p>Natasha's face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical kindliness.</p>
<p>"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is wonderful!" she cried, holding out her hand to him. "What are you doing? Why are you like this?"</p>
<p>Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on.</p>
<p>"What is the matter, Count?" asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone.</p>
<p>"What? What? Why? Don't ask me," said Pierre, and looked round at Natasha whose radiant, happy expression&#8212;of which he was conscious without looking at her&#8212;filled him with enchantment.</p>
<p>"Are you remaining in Moscow, then?"</p>
<p>Pierre hesitated.</p>
<p>"In Moscow?" he said in a questioning tone. "Yes, in Moscow. Good-bye!"</p>
<p>"Ah, if only I were a man? I'd certainly stay with you. How splendid!" said Natasha. "Mamma, if you'll let me, I'll stay!"</p>
<p>Pierre glanced absently at Natasha and was about to say something, but the countess interrupted him.</p>
<p>"You were at the battle, we heard."</p>
<p>"Yes, I was," Pierre answered. "There will be another battle tomorrow..." he began, but Natasha interrupted him.</p>
<p>"But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself...."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me! I don't know myself. Tomorrow... But no! Good-bye, good-by!" he muttered. "It's an awful time!" and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.</p>
<p>Natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.</p>
