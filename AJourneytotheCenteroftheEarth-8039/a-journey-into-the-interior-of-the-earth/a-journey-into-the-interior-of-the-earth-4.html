<h2 id="id01230" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h6 id="id01231">DE PROFUNDIS</h6>

<p id="id01232" style="margin-top: 2em">I therefore awoke next day relieved from the preoccupation of an
immediate start. Although we were in the very deepest of known
depths, there was something not unpleasant about it. And, besides, we
were beginning to get accustomed to this troglodyte<a id="noteref-9" href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-7.html#note-9">[9]</a> life. I no
longer thought of sun, moon, and stars, trees, houses, and towns, nor
of any of those terrestrial superfluities which are necessaries of
men who live upon the earth's surface. Being fossils, we looked upon
all those things as mere jokes.</p>

<p id="id01233">The grotto was an immense apartment. Along its granite floor ran our
faithful stream. At this distance from its spring the water was
scarcely tepid, and we drank of it with pleasure.</p>

<p id="id01234">After breakfast the Professor gave a few hours to the arrangement of
his daily notes.</p>

<p id="id01235">"First," said he, "I will make a calculation to ascertain our exact
position. I hope, after our return, to draw a map of our journey,
which will be in reality a vertical section of the globe, containing
the track of our expedition."</p>

<p id="id01236">"That will be curious, uncle; but are your observations sufficiently
accurate to enable you to do this correctly?"</p>

<p id="id01237">"Yes; I have everywhere observed the angles and the inclines. I am
sure there is no error. Let us see where we are now. Take your
compass, and note the direction."</p>

<p id="id01238">I looked, and replied carefully:</p>

<p id="id01240">"South-east by east."</p>

<p id="id01241">"Well," answered the Professor, after a rapid calculation, "I infer
that we have gone eighty-five leagues since we started."</p>

<p id="id01242">"Therefore we are under mid-Atlantic?"</p>

<p id="id01243">"To be sure we are."</p>

<p id="id01244">"And perhaps at this very moment there is a storm above, and ships
over our heads are being rudely tossed by the tempest."</p>

<p id="id01245">"Quite probable."</p>

<p id="id01246">"And whales are lashing the roof of our prison with their tails?"</p>

<p id="id01247">"It may be, Axel, but they won't shake us here. But let us go back to
our calculation. Here we are eighty-five leagues south-east of
Sn&#230;fell, and I reckon that we are at a depth of sixteen leagues."</p>

<p id="id01248">"Sixteen leagues?" I cried.</p>

<p id="id01249">"No doubt."</p>

<p id="id01250">"Why, this is the very limit assigned by science to the thickness of
the crust of the earth."</p>

<p id="id01251">"I don't deny it."</p>

<p id="id01252">"And here, according to the law of increasing temperature, there
ought to be a heat of 2,732&#176; Fahr.!"</p>

<p id="id01253">"So there should, my lad."</p>

<p id="id01254">"And all this solid granite ought to be running in fusion."</p>

<p id="id01255">"You see that it is not so, and that, as so often happens, facts come
to overthrow theories."</p>

<p id="id01256">"I am obliged to agree; but, after all, it is surprising."</p>

<p id="id01257">"What does the thermometer say?"</p>

<p id="id01258">"Twenty-seven, six tenths (82&#176; Fahr.)."</p>

<p id="id01259">"Therefore the savants are wrong by 2,705&#176;, and the proportional
increase is a mistake. Therefore Humphry Davy was right, and I am not
wrong in following him. What do you say now?"</p>

<p id="id01260">"Nothing."</p>

<p id="id01261">In truth, I had a good deal to say. I gave way in no respect to
Davy's theory. I still held to the central heat, although I did not
feel its effects. I preferred to admit in truth, that this chimney of
an extinct volcano, lined with lavas, which are non-conductors of
heat, did not suffer the heat to pass through its walls.</p>

<p id="id01262">But without stopping to look up new arguments I simply took up our
situation such as it was.</p>

<p id="id01263">"Well, admitting all your calculations to be quite correct, you must
allow me to draw one rigid result therefrom."</p>

<p id="id01264">"What is it. Speak freely."</p>

<p id="id01265">"At the latitude of Iceland, where we now are, the radius of the
earth, the distance from the centre to the surface is about 1,583
leagues; let us say in round numbers 1,600 leagues, or 4,800 miles.
Out of 1,600 leagues we have gone twelve!"</p>

<p id="id01266">"So you say."</p>

<p id="id01267">"And these twelve at a cost of 85 leagues diagonally?"</p>

<p id="id01268">"Exactly so."</p>

<p id="id01269">"In twenty days?"</p>

<p id="id01270">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01271">"Now, sixteen leagues are the hundredth part of the earth's radius.
At this rate we shall be two thousand days, or nearly five years and
a half, in getting to the centre."</p>

<p id="id01272">No answer was vouchsafed to this rational conclusion. "Without
reckoning, too, that if a vertical depth of sixteen leagues can be
attained only by a diagonal descent of eighty-four, it follows that
we must go eight thousand miles in a south-easterly direction; so
that we shall emerge from some point in the earth's circumference
instead of getting to the centre!"</p>

<p id="id01273">"Confusion to all your figures, and all your hypotheses besides,"
shouted my uncle in a sudden rage. "What is the basis of them all?
How do you know that this passage does not run straight to our
destination? Besides, there is a precedent. What one man has done,
another may do."</p>

<p id="id01274">"I hope so; but, still, I may be permitted&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id01275">"You shall have my leave to hold your tongue, Axel, but not to talk
in that irrational way."</p>

<p id="id01276">I could see the awful Professor bursting through my uncle's skin, and<br/>

I took timely warning.<br/></p>

<p id="id01277">"Now look at your aneroid. What does that say?"</p>

<p id="id01278">"It says we are under considerable pressure."</p>

<p id="id01279">"Very good; so you see that by going gradually down, and getting
accustomed to the density of the atmosphere, we don't suffer at all."</p>

<p id="id01280">"Nothing, except a little pain in the ears."</p>

<p id="id01281">"That's nothing, and you may get rid of even that by quick breathing
whenever you feel the pain."</p>

<p id="id01282">"Exactly so," I said, determined not to say a word that might cross
my uncle's prejudices. "There is even positive pleasure in living in
this dense atmosphere. Have you observed how intense sound is down
here?"</p>

<p id="id01283">"No doubt it is. A deaf man would soon learn to hear perfectly."</p>

<p id="id01284">"But won't this density augment?"</p>

<p id="id01285">"Yes; according to a rather obscure law. It is well known that the
weight of bodies diminishes as fast as we descend. You know that it
is at the surface of the globe that weight is most sensibly felt, and
that at the centre there is no weight at all."</p>

<p id="id01286">"I am aware of that; but, tell me, will not air at last acquire the
density of water?"</p>

<p id="id01287">"Of course, under a pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres."</p>

<p id="id01288">"And how, lower down still?"</p>

<p id="id01289">"Lower down the density will still increase."</p>

<p id="id01290">"But how shall we go down then."</p>

<p id="id01291">"Why, we must fill our pockets with stones."</p>

<p id="id01292">"Well, indeed, my worthy uncle, you are never at a loss for an
answer."</p>

<p id="id01293">I dared venture no farther into the region of probabilities, for I
might presently have stumbled upon an impossibility, which would have
brought the Professor on the scene when he was not wanted.</p>

<p id="id01294">Still, it was evident that the air, under a pressure which might
reach that of thousands of atmospheres, would at last reach the solid
state, and then, even if our bodies could resist the strain, we
should be stopped, and no reasonings would be able to get us on any
farther.</p>

<p id="id01295">But I did not advance this argument. My uncle would have met it with
his inevitable Saknussemm, a precedent which possessed no weight with
me; for even if the journey of the learned Icelander were really
attested, there was one very simple answer, that in the sixteenth
century there was neither barometer or aneroid and therefore
Saknussemm could not tell how far he had gone.</p>

<p id="id01296">But I kept this objection to myself, and waited the course of events.</p>

<p id="id01297">The rest of the day was passed in calculations and in conversations.
I remained a steadfast adherent of the opinions of Professor
Liedenbrock, and I envied the stolid indifference of Hans, who,
without going into causes and effects, went on with his eyes shut
wherever his destiny guided him.</p>

<h2 id="id01298" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h6 id="id01299">THE WORST PERIL OF ALL</h6>

<p id="id01300" style="margin-top: 2em">It must be confessed that hitherto things had not gone on so badly,
and that I had small reason to complain. If our difficulties became
no worse, we might hope to reach our end. And to what a height of
scientific glory we should then attain! I had become quite a
Liedenbrock in my reasonings; seriously I had. But would this state
of things last in the strange place we had come to? Perhaps it might.</p>

<p id="id01301">For several days steeper inclines, some even frightfully near to the
perpendicular, brought us deeper and deeper into the mass of the
interior of the earth. Some days we advanced nearer to the centre by
a league and a half, or nearly two leagues. These were perilous
descents, in which the skill and marvellous coolness of Hans were
invaluable to us. That unimpassioned Icelander devoted himself with
incomprehensible deliberation; and, thanks to him, we crossed many a
dangerous spot which we should never have cleared alone.</p>

<p id="id01302">But his habit of silence gained upon him day by day, and was
infecting us. External objects produce decided effects upon the
brain. A man shut up between four walls soon loses the power to
associate words and ideas together. How many prisoners in solitary
confinement become idiots, if not mad, for want of exercise for the
thinking faculty!</p>

<p id="id01303">During the fortnight following our last conversation, no incident
occurred worthy of being recorded. But I have good reason for
remembering one very serious event which took place at this time, and
of which I could scarcely now forget the smallest details.</p>

<p id="id01304">By the 7th of August our successive descents had brought us to a
depth of thirty leagues; that is, that for a space of thirty leagues
there were over our heads solid beds of rock, ocean, continents, and
towns. We must have been two hundred leagues from Iceland.</p>

<p id="id01305">On that day the tunnel went down a gentle slope. I was ahead of the
others. My uncle was carrying one of Ruhmkorff's lamps and I the
other. I was examining the beds of granite.</p>

<p id="id01306">Suddenly turning round I observed that I was alone.</p>

<p id="id01307">Well, well, I thought; I have been going too fast, or Hans and my
uncle have stopped on the way. Come, this won't do; I must join them.
Fortunately there is not much of an ascent.</p>

<p id="id01308">I retraced my steps. I walked for a quarter of an hour. I gazed into
the darkness. I shouted. No reply: my voice was lost in the midst of
the cavernous echoes which alone replied to my call.</p>

<p id="id01309">I began to feel uneasy. A shudder ran through me.</p>

<p id="id01310">"Calmly!" I said aloud to myself, "I am sure to find my companions
again. There are not two roads. I was too far ahead. I will return!"</p>

<p id="id01311">For half an hour I climbed up. I listened for a call, and in that
dense atmosphere a voice could reach very far. But there was a dreary
silence in all that long gallery. I stopped. I could not believe that
I was lost. I was only bewildered for a time, not lost. I was sure I
should find my way again.</p>

<p id="id01312">"Come," I repeated, "since there is but one road, and they are on it,
I must find them again. I have but to ascend still. Unless, indeed,
missing me, and supposing me to be behind, they too should have gone
back. But even in this case I have only to make the greater haste. I
shall find them, I am sure."</p>

<p id="id01313">I repeated these words in the fainter tones of a half-convinced man.
Besides, to associate even such simple ideas with words, and reason
with them, was a work of time.</p>

<p id="id01314">A doubt then seized upon me. Was I indeed in advance when we became
separated? Yes, to be sure I was. Hans was after me, preceding my
uncle. He had even stopped for a while to strap his baggage better
over his shoulders. I could remember this little incident. It was at
that very moment that I must have gone on.</p>

<p id="id01315">Besides, I thought, have not I a guarantee that I shall not lose my
way, a clue in the labyrinth, that cannot be broken, my faithful
stream? I have but to trace it back, and I must come upon them.</p>

<p id="id01316">This conclusion revived my spirits, and I resolved to resume my march
without loss of time.</p>

<p id="id01317">How I then blessed my uncle's foresight in preventing the hunter from
stopping up the hole in the granite. This beneficent spring, after
having satisfied our thirst on the road, would now be my guide among
the windings of the terrestrial crust.</p>

<p id="id01318">Before starting afresh I thought a wash would do me good. I stooped
to bathe my face in the Hansbach.</p>

<p id="id01319">To my stupefaction and utter dismay my feet trod only&#8212;the rough dry
granite. The stream was no longer at my feet.</p>

<h2 id="id01320" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h6 id="id01321">LOST IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH</h6>

<p id="id01322" style="margin-top: 2em">To describe my despair would be impossible. No words could tell it. I
was buried alive, with the prospect before me of dying of hunger and
thirst.</p>

<p id="id01323">Mechanically I swept the ground with my hands. How dry and hard the
rock seemed to me!</p>

<p id="id01324">But how had I left the course of the stream? For it was a terrible
fact that it no longer ran at my side. Then I understood the reason
of that fearful, silence, when for the last time I listened to hear
if any sound from my companions could reach my ears. At the moment
when I left the right road I had not noticed the absence of the
stream. It is evident that at that moment a deviation had presented
itself before me, whilst the Hansbach, following the caprice of
another incline, had gone with my companions away into unknown depths.</p>

<p id="id01325">How was I to return? There was not a trace of their footsteps or of
my own, for the foot left no mark upon the granite floor. I racked my
brain for a solution of this impracticable problem. One word
described my position. Lost!</p>

<p id="id01326">Lost at an immeasurable depth! Thirty leagues of rock seemed to weigh
upon my shoulders with a dreadful pressure. I felt crushed.</p>

<p id="id01327">I tried to carry back my ideas to things on the surface of the earth.
I could scarcely succeed. Hamburg, the house in the K&#246;nigstrasse, my
poor Gr&#228;uben, all that busy world underneath which I was wandering
about, was passing in rapid confusion before my terrified memory. I
could revive with vivid reality all the incidents of our voyage,
Iceland, M. Fridrikssen, Sn&#230;fell. I said to myself that if, in such a
position as I was now in, I was fool enough to cling to one glimpse
of hope, it would be madness, and that the best thing I could do was
to despair.</p>

<p id="id01328">What human power could restore me to the light of the sun by rending
asunder the huge arches of rock which united over my head,
buttressing each other with impregnable strength? Who could place my
feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?</p>

<p id="id01329">"Oh, my uncle!" burst from my lips in the tone of despair.</p>

<p id="id01330">It was my only word of reproach, for I knew how much he must be
suffering in seeking me, wherever he might be.</p>

<p id="id01331">When I saw myself thus far removed from all earthly help I had
recourse to heavenly succour. The remembrance of my childhood, the
recollection of my mother, whom I had only known in my tender early
years, came back to me, and I knelt in prayer imploring for the
Divine help of which I was so little worthy.</p>

<p id="id01332">This return of trust in God's providence allayed the turbulence of my
fears, and I was enabled to concentrate upon my situation all the
force of my intelligence.</p>

<p id="id01333">I had three days' provisions with me and my flask was full. But I
could not remain alone for long. Should I go up or down?</p>

<p id="id01334">Up, of course; up continually.</p>

<p id="id01335">I must thus arrive at the point where I had left the stream, that
fatal turn in the road. With the stream at my feet, I might hope to
regain the summit of Sn&#230;fell.</p>

<p id="id01336">Why had I not thought of that sooner? Here was evidently a chance of
safety. The most pressing duty was to find out again the course of
the Hansbach. I rose, and leaning upon my iron-pointed stick I
ascended the gallery. The slope was rather steep. I walked on without
hope but without indecision, like a man who has made up his mind.</p>

<p id="id01337">For half an hour I met with no obstacle. I tried to recognise my way
by the form of the tunnel, by the projections of certain rocks, by
the disposition of the fractures. But no particular sign appeared,
and I soon saw that this gallery could not bring me back to the
turning point. It came to an abrupt end. I struck against an
impenetrable wall, and fell down upon the rock.</p>

<p id="id01338">Unspeakable despair then seized upon me. I lay overwhelmed, aghast!<br/>

My last hope was shattered against this granite wall.<br/></p>

<p id="id01339">Lost in this labyrinth, whose windings crossed each other in all
directions, it was no use to think of flight any longer. Here I must
die the most dreadful of deaths. And, strange to say, the thought
came across me that when some day my petrified remains should be
found thirty leagues below the surface in the bowels of the earth,
the discovery might lead to grave scientific discussions.</p>

<p id="id01340">I tried to speak aloud, but hoarse sounds alone passed my dry lips. I
panted for breath.</p>

<p id="id01341">In the midst of my agony a new terror laid hold of me. In falling my
lamp had got wrong. I could not set it right, and its light was
paling and would soon disappear altogether.</p>

<p id="id01342">I gazed painfully upon the luminous current growing weaker and weaker
in the wire coil. A dim procession of moving shadows seemed slowly
unfolding down the darkening walls. I scarcely dared to shut my eyes
for one moment, for fear of losing the least glimmer of this precious
light. Every instant it seemed about to vanish and the dense
blackness to come rolling in palpably upon me.</p>

<p id="id01343">One last trembling glimmer shot feebly up. I watched it in trembling
and anxiety; I drank it in as if I could preserve it, concentrating
upon it the full power of my eyes, as upon the very last sensation of
light which they were ever to experience, and the next moment I lay
in the heavy gloom of deep, thick, unfathomable darkness.</p>

<p id="id01344">A terrible cry of anguish burst from me. Upon earth, in the midst of
the darkest night, light never abdicates its functions altogether. It
is still subtle and diffusive, but whatever little there may be, the
eye still catches that little. Here there was not an atom; the total
darkness made me totally blind.</p>

<p id="id01345">Then I began to lose my head. I arose with my arms stretched out
before me, attempting painfully to feel my way. I began to run
wildly, hurrying through the inextricable maze, still descending,
still running through the substance of the earth's thick crust, a
struggling denizen of geological 'faults,' crying, shouting, yelling,
soon bruised by contact with the jagged rock, falling and rising
again bleeding, trying to drink the blood which covered my face, and
even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against.</p>

<p id="id01346">I shall never know whither my mad career took me. After the lapse of
some hours, no doubt exhausted, I fell like a lifeless lump at the
foot of the wall, and lost all consciousness.</p>

<h2 id="id01347" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h6 id="id01348">THE RESCUE IN THE WHISPERING GALLERY</h6>

<p id="id01349" style="margin-top: 2em">When I returned to partial life my face was wet with tears. How long
that state of insensibility had lasted I cannot say. I had no means
now of taking account of time. Never was solitude equal to this,
never had any living being been so utterly forsaken.</p>

<p id="id01350">After my fall I had lost a good deal of blood. I felt it flowing over
me. Ah! how happy I should have been could I have died, and if death
were not yet to be gone through. I would think no longer. I drove
away every idea, and, conquered by my grief, I rolled myself to the
foot of the opposite wall.</p>

<p id="id01351">Already I was feeling the approach of another faint, and was hoping
for complete annihilation, when a loud noise reached me. It was like
the distant rumble of continuous thunder, and I could hear its
sounding undulations rolling far away into the remote recesses of the
abyss.</p>

<p id="id01352">Whence could this noise proceed? It must be from some phenomenon
proceeding in the great depths amidst which I lay helpless. Was it an
explosion of gas? Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?</p>

<p id="id01353">I listened still. I wanted to know if the noise would be repeated. A
quarter of an hour passed away. Silence reigned in this gallery. I
could not hear even the beating of my heart.</p>

<p id="id01354">Suddenly my ear, resting by chance against the wall, caught, or
seemed to catch, certain vague, indescribable, distant, articulate
sounds, as of words.</p>

<p id="id01355">"This is a delusion," I thought.</p>

<p id="id01356">But it was not. Listening more attentively, I heard in reality a
murmuring of voices. But my weakness prevented me from understanding
what the voices said. Yet it was language, I was sure of it.</p>

<p id="id01357">For a moment I feared the words might be my own, brought back by the
echo. Perhaps I had been crying out unknown to myself. I closed my
lips firmly, and laid my ear against the wall again.</p>

<p id="id01358">"Yes, truly, some one is speaking; those are words!"</p>

<p id="id01359">Even a few feet from the wall I could hear distinctly. I succeeded in
catching uncertain, strange, undistinguishable words. They came as if
pronounced in low murmured whispers. The word '<i>forlorad</i>' was
several times repeated in a tone of sympathy and sorrow.</p>

<p id="id01360">"Help!" I cried with all my might. "Help!"</p>

<p id="id01361">I listened, I watched in the darkness for an answer, a cry, a mere
breath of sound, but nothing came. Some minutes passed. A whole world
of ideas had opened in my mind. I thought that my weakened voice
could never penetrate to my companions.</p>

<p id="id01362">"It is they," I repeated. "What other men can be thirty leagues under
ground?"</p>

<p id="id01363">I again began to listen. Passing my ear over the wall from one place
to another, I found the point where the voices seemed to be best
heard. The word '<i>forlorad</i>' again returned; then the rolling of
thunder which had roused me from my lethargy.</p>

<p id="id01364">"No," I said, "no; it is not through such a mass that a voice can be
heard. I am surrounded by granite walls, and the loudest explosion
could never be heard here! This noise comes along the gallery. There
must be here some remarkable exercise of acoustic laws!"</p>

<p id="id01365">I listened again, and this time, yes this time, I did distinctly hear
my name pronounced across the wide interval.</p>

<p id="id01366">It was my uncle's own voice! He was talking to the guide. And
'<i>forlorad</i>' is a Danish word.</p>

<p id="id01367">Then I understood it all. To make myself heard, I must speak along
this wall, which would conduct the sound of my voice just as wire
conducts electricity.</p>

<p id="id01368">But there was no time to lose. If my companions moved but a few steps
away, the acoustic phenomenon would cease. I therefore approached the
wall, and pronounced these words as clearly as possible:</p>

<p id="id01369">"Uncle Liedenbrock!"</p>

<p id="id01370">I waited with the deepest anxiety. Sound does not travel with great
velocity. Even increased density air has no effect upon its rate of
travelling; it merely augments its intensity. Seconds, which seemed
ages, passed away, and at last these words reached me:</p>

<p id="id01371">"Axel! Axel! is it you?"</p>

<p id="id01372">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01373">"Yes, yes," I replied.</p>

<p id="id01374">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01375">"My boy, where are you?"</p>

<p id="id01376">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01377">"Lost, in the deepest darkness."</p>

<p id="id01378">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01379">"Where is your lamp?"</p>

<p id="id01380">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01381">"It is out."</p>

<p id="id01382">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01383">"And the stream?"</p>

<p id="id01384">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01385">"Disappeared."</p>

<p id="id01386">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01387">"Axel, Axel, take courage!"</p>

<p id="id01388">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01389">"Wait! I am exhausted! I can't answer. Speak to me!"</p>

<p id="id01390">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01391">"Courage," resumed my uncle. "Don't speak. Listen to me. We have
looked for you up the gallery and down the gallery. Could not find
you. I wept for you, my poor boy. At last, supposing you were still
on the Hansbach, we fired our guns. Our voices are audible to each
other, but our hands cannot touch. But don't despair, Axel! It is a
great thing that we can hear each other."</p>

<p id="id01392">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01393">During this time I had been reflecting. A vague hope was returning to
my heart. There was one thing I must know to begin with. I placed my
lips close to the wall, saying:</p>

<p id="id01394">"My uncle!"</p>

<p id="id01395">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01396">"My boy!" came to me after a few seconds.</p>

<p id="id01397">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01398">"We must know how far we are apart."</p>

<p id="id01399">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01400">"That is easy."</p>

<p id="id01401">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01402">"You have your chronometer?"</p>

<p id="id01403">. . .</p>

<p id="id01404">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01405">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01406">"Well, take it. Pronounce my name, noting exactly the second when you
speak. I will repeat it as soon as it shall come to me, and you will
observe the exact moment when you get my answer."</p>

<p id="id01407">"Yes; and half the time between my call and your answer will exactly
indicate that which my voice will take in coming to you."</p>

<p id="id01408">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01409">"Just so, my uncle."</p>

<p id="id01410">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01411">"Are you ready?"</p>

<p id="id01412">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01413">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01414">. . . . . .</p>

<p id="id01415">"Now, attention. I am going to call your name."</p>

<p id="id01416">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01417">I put my ear to the wall, and as soon as the name 'Axel' came I
immediately replied "Axel," then waited.</p>

<p id="id01418">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01419">"Forty seconds," said my uncle. "Forty seconds between the two words;
so the sound takes twenty seconds in coming. Now, at the rate of
1,120 feet in a second, this is 22,400 feet, or four miles and a
quarter, nearly."</p>

<p id="id01420">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01421">"Four miles and a quarter!" I murmured.</p>

<p id="id01422">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01423">"It will soon be over, Axel."</p>

<p id="id01424">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01425">"Must I go up or down?"</p>

<p id="id01426">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01427">"Down&#8212;for this reason: We are in a vast chamber, with endless
galleries. Yours must lead into it, for it seems as if all the clefts
and fractures of the globe radiated round this vast cavern. So get
up, and begin walking. Walk on, drag yourself along, if necessary
slide down the steep places, and at the end you will find us ready to
receive you. Now begin moving."</p>

<p id="id01428">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01429">These words cheered me up.</p>

<p id="id01430">"Good bye, uncle." I cried. "I am going. There will be no more voices
heard when once I have started. So good bye!"</p>

<p id="id01431">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01432">"Good bye, Axel, <i>au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p id="id01433">. . . .</p>

<p id="id01434">These were the last words I heard.</p>

<p id="id01435">This wonderful underground conversation, carried on with a distance
of four miles and a quarter between us, concluded with these words of
hope. I thanked God from my heart, for it was He who had conducted me
through those vast solitudes to the point where, alone of all others
perhaps, the voices of my companions could have reached me.</p>

<p id="id01436">This acoustic effect is easily explained on scientific grounds. It
arose from the concave form of the gallery and the conducting power
of the rock. There are many examples of this propagation of sounds
which remain unheard in the intermediate space. I remember that a
similar phenomenon has been observed in many places; amongst others
on the internal surface of the gallery of the dome of St. Paul's in
London, and especially in the midst of the curious caverns among the
quarries near Syracuse, the most wonderful of which is called
Dionysius' Ear.</p>

<p id="id01437">These remembrances came into my mind, and I clearly saw that since my
uncle's voice really reached me, there could be no obstacle between
us. Following the direction by which the sound came, of course I
should arrive in his presence, if my strength did not fail me.</p>

<p id="id01438">I therefore rose; I rather dragged myself than walked. The slope was
rapid, and I slid down.</p>

<p id="id01439">Soon the swiftness of the descent increased horribly, and threatened
to become a fall. I no longer had the strength to stop myself.</p>

<p id="id01440">Suddenly there was no ground under me. I felt myself revolving in
air, striking and rebounding against the craggy projections of a
vertical gallery, quite a well; my head struck against a sharp corner
of the rock, and I became unconscious.</p>

<h2 id="id01441" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h6 id="id01442">THALATTA! THALATTA!</h6>

<p id="id01443" style="margin-top: 2em">When I came to myself, I was stretched in half darkness, covered with
thick coats and blankets. My uncle was watching over me, to discover
the least sign of life. At my first sigh he took my hand; when I
opened my eyes he uttered a cry of joy.</p>

<p id="id01444">"He lives! he lives!" he cried.</p>

<p id="id01445">"Yes, I am still alive," I answered feebly.</p>

<p id="id01446">"My dear nephew," said my uncle, pressing me to his breast, "you are
saved."</p>

<p id="id01447">I was deeply touched with the tenderness of his manner as he uttered
these words, and still more with the care with which he watched over
me. But such trials were wanted to bring out the Professor's tenderer
qualities.</p>

<p id="id01448">At this moment Hans came, he saw my hand in my uncle's, and I may
safely say that there was joy in his countenance.</p>

<p id="id01449">"<i>God dag,</i>" said he.</p>

<p id="id01450">"How do you do, Hans? How are you? And now, uncle, tell me where we
are at the present moment?"</p>

<p id="id01451">"To-morrow, Axel, to-morrow. Now you are too faint and weak. I have
bandaged your head with compresses which must not be disturbed. Sleep
now, and to-morrow I will tell you all."</p>

<p id="id01452">"But do tell me what time it is, and what day."</p>

<p id="id01453">"It is Sunday, the 8th of August, and it is ten at night. You must
ask me no more questions until the 10th."</p>

<p id="id01454">In truth I was very weak, and my eyes involuntarily closed. I wanted
a good night's rest; and I therefore went off to sleep, with the
knowledge that I had been four long days alone in the heart of the
earth.</p>

<p id="id01455">Next morning, on awakening, I looked round me. My couch, made up of
all our travelling gear, was in a charming grotto, adorned with
splendid stalactites, and the soil of which was a fine sand. It was
half light. There was no torch, no lamp, yet certain mysterious
glimpses of light came from without through a narrow opening in the
grotto. I heard too a vague and indistinct noise, something like the
murmuring of waves breaking upon a shingly shore, and at times I
seemed to hear the whistling of wind.</p>

<p id="id01456">I wondered whether I was awake, whether I was dreaming, whether my brain,
crazed by my fall, was not affected by imaginary noises. Yet neither
eyes, nor ears could be so utterly deceived.</p>

<p id="id01457">It is a ray of daylight, I thought, sliding in through this cleft in
the rock! That is indeed the murmuring of waves! That is the rustling
noise of wind. Am I quite mistaken, or have we returned to the
surface of the earth? Has my uncle given up the expedition, or is it
happily terminated?</p>

<p id="id01458">I was asking myself these unanswerable questions when the Professor
entered.</p>

<p id="id01459">"Good morning, Axel," he cried cheerily. "I feel sure you are better."</p>

<p id="id01460">"Yes, I am indeed," said I, sitting up on my couch.</p>

<p id="id01461">"You can hardly fail to be better, for you have slept quietly. Hans
and I watched you by turns, and we have noticed you were evidently
recovering."</p>

<p id="id01462">"Indeed, I do feel a great deal better, and I will give you a proof
of that presently if you will let me have my breakfast."</p>

<p id="id01463">"You shall eat, lad. The fever has left you. Hans rubbed your wounds
with some ointment or other of which the Icelanders keep the secret,
and they have healed marvellously. Our hunter is a splendid fellow!"</p>

<p id="id01464">Whilst he went on talking, my uncle prepared a few provisions, which
I devoured eagerly, notwithstanding his advice to the contrary. All
the while I was overwhelming him with questions which he answered
readily.</p>

<p id="id01465">I then learnt that my providential fall had brought me exactly to the
extremity of an almost perpendicular shaft; and as I had landed in
the midst of an accompanying torrent of stones, the least of which
would have been enough to crush me, the conclusion was that a loose
portion of the rock had come down with me. This frightful conveyance
had thus carried me into the arms of my uncle, where I fell bruised,
bleeding, and insensible.</p>

<p id="id01466">"Truly it is wonderful that you have not been killed a hundred times
over. But, for the love of God, don't let us ever separate again, or
we many never see each other more."</p>

<p id="id01467">"Not separate! Is the journey not over, then?" I opened a pair of
astonished eyes, which immediately called for the question:</p>

<p id="id01468">"What is the matter, Axel?"</p>

<p id="id01469">"I have a question to ask you. You say that I am safe and sound?"</p>

<p id="id01470">"No doubt you are."</p>

<p id="id01471">"And all my limbs unbroken?"</p>

<p id="id01472">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id01473">"And my head?"</p>

<p id="id01474">"Your head, except for a few bruises, is all right; and it is on your
shoulders, where it ought to be."</p>

<p id="id01475">"Well, I am afraid my brain is affected."</p>

<p id="id01476">"Your mind affected!"</p>

<p id="id01477">"Yes, I fear so. Are we again on the surface of the globe?"</p>

<p id="id01478">"No, certainly not."</p>

<p id="id01479">"Then I must be mad; for don't I see the light of day, and don't I
hear the wind blowing, and the sea breaking on the shore?"</p>

<p id="id01480">"Ah! is that all?"</p>

<p id="id01481">"Do tell me all about it."</p>

<p id="id01482">"I can't explain the inexplicable, but you will soon see and
understand that geology has not yet learnt all it has to learn."</p>

<p id="id01483">"Then let us go," I answered quickly.</p>

<p id="id01484">"No, Axel; the open air might be bad for you."</p>

<p id="id01485">"Open air?"</p>

<p id="id01486">"Yes; the wind is rather strong. You must not expose yourself."</p>

<p id="id01487">"But I assure you I am perfectly well."</p>

<p id="id01488">"A little patience, my nephew. A relapse might get us into trouble,
and we have no time to lose, for the voyage may be a long one."</p>

<p id="id01489">"The voyage!"</p>

<p id="id01490">"Yes, rest to-day, and to-morrow we will set sail."</p>

<p id="id01491">"Set sail!"&#8212;and I almost leaped up.</p>

<p id="id01492">What did it all mean? Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?<br/>

Was there a ship at our disposal in some underground harbour?<br/></p>

<p id="id01493">My curiosity was highly excited, my uncle vainly tried to restrain
me. When he saw that my impatience was doing me harm, he yielded.</p>

<p id="id01494">I dressed in haste. For greater safety I wrapped myself in a blanket,
and came out of the grotto.</p>

<h2 id="id01495" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h6 id="id01496">A NEW MARE INTERNUM</h6>

<p id="id01497" style="margin-top: 2em">At first I could hardly see anything. My eyes, unaccustomed to the
light, quickly closed. When I was able to reopen them, I stood more
stupefied even than surprised.</p>

<p id="id01498">"The sea!" I cried.</p>

<p id="id01499">"Yes," my uncle replied, "the Liedenbrock Sea; and I don't suppose
any other discoverer will ever dispute my claim to name it after
myself as its first discoverer."</p>

<p id="id01500">A vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread
far away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that
open sea which drew from Xenophon's ten thousand Greeks, after their
long retreat, the simultaneous cry, "Thalatta! thalatta!" the sea!
the sea! The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine
shining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small
shells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The
waves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to
vast inclosed spaces. A light foam flew over the waves before the
breath of a moderate breeze, and some of the spray fell upon my face.
On this slightly inclining shore, about a hundred fathoms from the
limit of the waves, came down the foot of a huge wall of vast cliffs,
which rose majestically to an enormous height. Some of these,
dividing the beach with their sharp spurs, formed capes and
promontories, worn away by the ceaseless action of the surf. Farther
on the eye discerned their massive outline sharply defined against
the hazy distant horizon.</p>

<p id="id01501">It was quite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert
and frightfully wild in appearance.</p>

<p id="id01502">If my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea, it was
because a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it. It was
not the light of the sun, with his dazzling shafts of brightness and
the splendour of his rays; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer
of the moonbeams, the dim reflection of a nobler body of light. No;
the illuminating power of this light, its trembling diffusiveness,
its bright, clear whiteness, and its low temperature, showed that it
must be of electric origin. It was like an aurora borealis, a
continuous cosmical phenomenon, filling a cavern of sufficient extent
to contain an ocean.</p>

<p id="id01503">The vault that spanned the space above, the sky, if it could be
called so, seemed composed of vast plains of cloud, shifting and
variable vapours, which by their condensation must at certain times
fall in torrents of rain. I should have thought that under so
powerful a pressure of the atmosphere there could be no evaporation;
and yet, under a law unknown to me, there were broad tracts of vapour
suspended in the air. But then 'the weather was fine.' The play of
the electric light produced singular effects upon the upper strata of
cloud. Deep shadows reposed upon their lower wreaths; and often,
between two separated fields of cloud, there glided down a ray of
unspeakable lustre. But it was not solar light, and there was no
heat. The general effect was sad, supremely melancholy. Instead of
the shining firmament, spangled with its innumerable stars, shining
singly or in clusters, I felt that all these subdued and shaded
lights were ribbed in by vast walls of granite, which seemed to
overpower me with their weight, and that all this space, great as it
was, would not be enough for the march of the humblest of satellites.</p>

<p id="id01504">Then I remembered the theory of an English captain, who likened the
earth to a vast hollow sphere, in the interior of which the air
became luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it;
while two stars, Pluto and Proserpine, rolled within upon the circuit
of their mysterious orbits.</p>

<p id="id01505">We were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation. Its
width could not be estimated, since the shore ran widening as far as
eye could reach, nor could its length, for the dim horizon bounded
the new. As for its height, it must have been several leagues. Where
this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell; but there
was a cloud hanging far above, the height of which we estimated at
12,000 feet, a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour,
and no doubt due to the great density of the air.</p>

<p id="id01506">The word cavern does not convey any idea of this immense space; words
of human tongue are inadequate to describe the discoveries of him who
ventures into the deep abysses of earth.</p>

<p id="id01507">Besides I could not tell upon what geological theory to account for
the existence of such an excavation. Had the cooling of the globe
produced it? I knew of celebrated caverns from the descriptions of
travellers, but had never heard of any of such dimensions as this.</p>

<p id="id01508">If the grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by Humboldt, had not
given up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher, who
investigated it to the depth of 2,500 feet, it probably did not
extend much farther. The immense mammoth cave in Kentucky is of
gigantic proportions, since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet<a id="noteref-10" href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-7.html#note-10">[10]</a> above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have
explored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles. But what
were these cavities compared to that in which I stood with wonder and
admiration, with its sky of luminous vapours, its bursts of electric
light, and a vast sea filling its bed? My imagination fell powerless
before such immensity.</p>

<p id="id01509">I gazed upon these wonders in silence. Words failed me to express my
feelings. I felt as if I was in some distant planet Uranus or
Neptune&#8212;and in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial
experience gave me no cognisance. For such novel sensations, new words
were wanted; and my imagination failed to supply them. I gazed, I
thought, I admired, with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of
fear.</p>

<p id="id01510">The unforeseen nature of this spectacle brought back the colour to my
cheeks. I was under a new course of treatment with the aid of
astonishment, and my convalescence was promoted by this novel system
of therapeutics; besides, the dense and breezy air invigorated me,
supplying more oxygen to my lungs.</p>

<p id="id01511">It will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven
days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to
breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles.</p>

<p id="id01513">I was delighted to leave my dark grotto. My uncle, already familiar
with these wonders, had ceased to feel surprise.</p>

<p id="id01514">"You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id01515">"Yes, certainly; and nothing could be more delightful."</p>

<p id="id01516">"Well, take my arm, Axel, and let us follow the windings of the
shore."</p>

<p id="id01517">I eagerly accepted, and we began to coast along this new sea. On the
left huge pyramids of rock, piled one upon another, produced a
prodigious titanic effect. Down their sides flowed numberless
waterfalls, which went on their way in brawling but pellucid streams.
A few light vapours, leaping from rock to rock, denoted the place of
hot springs; and streams flowed softly down to the common basin,
gliding down the gentle slopes with a softer murmur.</p>

<p id="id01518">Amongst these streams I recognised our faithful travelling companion,
the Hansbach, coming to lose its little volume quietly in the mighty
sea, just as if it had done nothing else since the beginning of the
world.</p>

<p id="id01519">"We shall see it no more," I said, with a sigh.</p>

<p id="id01520">"What matters," replied the philosopher, "whether this or another
serves to guide us?"</p>

<p id="id01521">I thought him rather ungrateful.</p>

<p id="id01522">But at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight. At
a distance of five hundred paces, at the turn of a high promontory,
appeared a high, tufted, dense forest. It was composed of trees of
moderate height, formed like umbrellas, with exact geometrical
outlines. The currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon
their shape, and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved
and firm, just like a clump of petrified cedars.</p>

<p id="id01523">I hastened forward. I could not give any name to these singular
creations. Were they some of the two hundred thousand species of
vegetables known hitherto, and did they claim a place of their own in
the lacustrine flora? No; when we arrived under their shade my
surprise turned into admiration. There stood before me productions of
earth, but of gigantic stature, which my uncle immediately named.</p>

<p id="id01524">"It is only a forest of mushrooms," said he.</p>

<p id="id01525">And he was right. Imagine the large development attained by these
plants, which prefer a warm, moist climate. I knew that the
<i>Lycopodon giganteum</i> attains, according to Bulliard, a circumference
of eight or nine feet; but here were pale mushrooms, thirty to forty
feet high, and crowned with a cap of equal diameter. There they stood
in thousands. No light could penetrate between their huge cones, and
complete darkness reigned beneath those giants; they formed
settlements of domes placed in close array like the round, thatched
roofs of a central African city.</p>

<p id="id01526">Yet I wanted to penetrate farther underneath, though a chill fell
upon me as soon as I came under those cellular vaults. For half an
hour we wandered from side to side in the damp shades, and it was a
comfortable and pleasant change to arrive once more upon the sea
shore.</p>

<p id="id01527">But the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi.
Farther on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy
to recognise. They were lowly shrubs of earth, here attaining
gigantic size; lycopodiums, a hundred feet high; the huge sigillaria,
found in our coal mines; tree ferns, as tall as our fir-trees in
northern latitudes; lepidodendra, with cylindrical forked stems,
terminated by long leaves, and bristling with rough hairs like those
of the cactus.</p>

<p id="id01528">"Wonderful, magnificent, splendid!" cried my uncle. "Here is the
entire flora of the second period of the world&#8212;the transition
period. These, humble garden plants with us, were tall trees in the
early ages. Look, Axel, and admire it all. Never had botanist such a
feast as this!"</p>

<p id="id01529">"You are right, my uncle. Providence seems to have preserved in this
immense conservatory the antediluvian plants which the wisdom of
philosophers has so sagaciously put together again."</p>

<p id="id01530">"It is a conservatory, Axel; but is it not also a menagerie?"</p>

<p id="id01531">"Surely not a menagerie!"</p>

<p id="id01532">"Yes; no doubt of it. Look at that dust under your feet; see the
bones scattered on the ground."</p>

<p id="id01533">"So there are!" I cried; "bones of extinct animals."</p>

<p id="id01534">I had rushed upon these remains, formed of indestructible phosphates
of lime, and without hesitation I named these monstrous bones, which
lay scattered about like decayed trunks of trees.</p>

<p id="id01535">"Here is the lower jaw of a mastodon,"<a id="noteref-11" href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-7.html#note-11">[11]</a> I said. "These are the
molar teeth of the deinotherium; this femur must have belonged to the
greatest of those beasts, the megatherium. It certainly is a
menagerie, for these remains were not brought here by a deluge. The
animals to which they belonged roamed on the shores of this
subterranean sea, under the shade of those arborescent trees. Here
are entire skeletons. And yet I cannot understand the appearance of
these quadrupeds in a granite cavern."</p>

<p id="id01537">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id01538">"Because animal life existed upon the earth only in the secondary
period, when a sediment of soil had been deposited by the rivers, and
taken the place of the incandescent rocks of the primitive period."</p>

<p id="id01539">"Well, Axel, there is a very simple answer to your objection that
this soil is alluvial."</p>

<p id="id01540">"What! at such a depth below the surface of the earth?"</p>

<p id="id01541">"No doubt; and there is a geological explanation of the fact. At a
certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust or bark,
alternately acted on by forces from above or below, according to the
laws of attraction and gravitation. Probably there were subsidences
of the outer crust, when a portion of the sedimentary deposits was
carried down sudden openings."</p>

<p id="id01542">"That may be," I replied; "but if there have been creatures now
extinct in these underground regions, why may not some of those
monsters be now roaming through these gloomy forests, or hidden
behind the steep crags?"</p>

<p id="id01543">And as this unpleasant notion got hold of me, I surveyed with anxious
scrutiny the open spaces before me; but no living creature appeared
upon the barren strand.</p>

<p id="id01544">I felt rather tired, and went to sit down at the end of a promontory,
at the foot of which the waves came and beat themselves into spray.
Thence my eye could sweep every part of the bay; within its extremity
a little harbour was formed between the pyramidal cliffs, where the
still waters slept untouched by the boisterous winds. A brig and two
or three schooners might have moored within it in safety. I almost
fancied I should presently see some ship issue from it, full sail,
and take to the open sea under the southern breeze.</p>

<p id="id01545">But this illusion lasted a very short time. We were the only living
creatures in this subterranean world. When the wind lulled, a deeper
silence than that of the deserts fell upon the arid, naked rocks, and
weighed upon the surface of the ocean. I then desired to pierce the
distant haze, and to rend asunder the mysterious curtain that hung
across the horizon. Anxious queries arose to my lips. Where did that
sea terminate? Where did it lead to? Should we ever know anything
about its opposite shores?</p>

<p id="id01546">My uncle made no doubt about it at all; I both desired and feared.</p>

<p id="id01547">After spending an hour in the contemplation of this marvellous
spectacle, we returned to the shore to regain the grotto, and I fell
asleep in the midst of the strangest thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="id01548" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h6 id="id01549">PREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY</h6>

<p id="id01550" style="margin-top: 2em">The next morning I awoke feeling perfectly well. I thought a bathe
would do me good, and I went to plunge for a few minutes into the
waters of this mediterranean sea, for assuredly it better deserved
this name than any other sea.</p>

<p id="id01551">I came back to breakfast with a good appetite. Hans was a good
caterer for our little household; he had water and fire at his
disposal, so that he was able to vary our bill of fare now and then.
For dessert he gave us a few cups of coffee, and never was coffee so
delicious.</p>

<p id="id01552">"Now," said my uncle, "now is the time for high tide, and we must not
lose the opportunity to study this phenomenon."</p>

<p id="id01553">"What! the tide!" I cried. "Can the influence of the sun and moon be
felt down here?"</p>

<p id="id01554">"Why not? Are not all bodies subject throughout their mass to the
power of universal attraction? This mass of water cannot escape the
general law. And in spite of the heavy atmospheric pressure on the
surface, you will see it rise like the Atlantic itself."</p>

<p id="id01555">At the same moment we reached the sand on the shore, and the waves
were by slow degrees encroaching on the shore.</p>

<p id="id01556">"Here is the tide rising," I cried.</p>

<p id="id01557">"Yes, Axel; and judging by these ridges of foam, you may observe that
the sea will rise about twelve feet."</p>

<p id="id01558">"This is wonderful," I said.</p>

<p id="id01559">"No; it is quite natural."</p>

<p id="id01560">"You may say so, uncle; but to me it is most extraordinary, and I can
hardly believe my eyes. Who would ever have imagined, under this
terrestrial crust, an ocean with ebbing and flowing tides, with winds
and storms?"</p>

<p id="id01561">"Well," replied my uncle, "is there any scientific reason against it?"</p>

<p id="id01562">"No; I see none, as soon as the theory of central heat is given up."
"So then, thus far," he answered, "the theory of Sir Humphry Davy is
confirmed."</p>

<p id="id01563">"Evidently it is; and now there is no reason why there should not be
seas and continents in the interior of the earth."</p>

<p id="id01564">"No doubt," said my uncle; "and inhabited too."</p>

<p id="id01565">"To be sure," said I; "and why should not these waters yield to us
fishes of unknown species?"</p>

<p id="id01566">"At any rate," he replied, "we have not seen any yet."</p>

<p id="id01567">"Well, let us make some lines, and see if the bait will draw here as
it does in sublunary regions."</p>

<p id="id01568">"We will try, Axel, for we must penetrate all secrets of these newly
discovered regions."</p>

<p id="id01569">"But where are we, uncle? for I have not yet asked you that question,
and your instruments must be able to furnish the answer."</p>

<p id="id01570">"Horizontally, three hundred and fifty leagues from Iceland."</p>

<p id="id01571">"So much as that?"</p>

<p id="id01572">"I am sure of not being a mile out of my reckoning."</p>

<p id="id01573">"And does the compass still show south-east?"</p>

<p id="id01574">"Yes; with a westerly deviation of nineteen degrees forty-five
minutes, just as above ground. As for its dip, a curious fact is
coming to light, which I have observed carefully: that the needle,
instead of dipping towards the pole as in the northern hemisphere, on
the contrary, rises from it."</p>

<p id="id01575">"Would you then conclude," I said, "that the magnetic pole is
somewhere between the surface of the globe and the point where we
are?"</p>

<p id="id01576">"Exactly so; and it is likely enough that if we were to reach the
spot beneath the polar regions, about that seventy-first degree where
Sir James Ross has discovered the magnetic pole to be situated, we
should see the needle point straight up. Therefore that mysterious
centre of attraction is at no great depth."</p>

<p id="id01577">I remarked: "It is so; and here is a fact which science has scarcely
suspected."</p>

<p id="id01578">"Science, my lad, has been built upon many errors; but they are
errors which it was good to fall into, for they led to the truth."</p>

<p id="id01579">"What depth have we now reached?"</p>

<p id="id01580">"We are thirty-five leagues below the surface."</p>

<p id="id01581">"So," I said, examining the map, "the Highlands of Scotland are over
our heads, and the Grampians are raising their rugged summits above
us."</p>

<p id="id01582">"Yes," answered the Professor laughing. "It is rather a heavy weight
to bear, but a solid arch spans over our heads. The great Architect
has built it of the best materials; and never could man have given it
so wide a stretch. What are the finest arches of bridges and the
arcades of cathedrals, compared with this far reaching vault, with a
radius of three leagues, beneath which a wide and tempest-tossed
ocean may flow at its ease?"</p>

<p id="id01583">"Oh, I am not afraid that it will fall down upon my head. But now
what are your plans? Are you not thinking of returning to the surface
now?"</p>

<p id="id01584">"Return! no, indeed! We will continue our journey, everything having
gone on well so far."</p>

<p id="id01585">"But how are we to get down below this liquid surface?"</p>

<p id="id01586">"Oh, I am not going to dive head foremost. But if all oceans are
properly speaking but lakes, since they are encompassed by land, of
course this internal sea will be surrounded by a coast of granite,
and on the opposite shores we shall find fresh passages opening."</p>

<p id="id01587">"How long do you suppose this sea to be?"</p>

<p id="id01588">"Thirty or forty leagues; so that we have no time to lose, and we
shall set sail to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id01589">I looked about for a ship.</p>

<p id="id01590">"Set sail, shall we? But I should like to see my boat first."</p>

<p id="id01591">"It will not be a boat at all, but a good, well-made raft."</p>

<p id="id01592">"Why," I said, "a raft would be just as hard to make as a boat, and I
don't see&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id01593">"I know you don't see; but you might hear if you would listen. Don't
you hear the hammer at work? Hans is already busy at it."</p>

<p id="id01594">"What, has he already felled the trees?"</p>

<p id="id01595">"Oh, the trees were already down. Come, and you will see for
yourself."</p>

<p id="id01596">After half an hour's walking, on the other side of the promontory
which formed the little natural harbour, I perceived Hans at work. In
a few more steps I was at his side. To my great surprise a
half-finished raft was already lying on the sand, made of a peculiar
kind of wood, and a great number of planks, straight and bent, and of
frames, were covering the ground, enough almost for a little fleet.</p>

<p id="id01597">"Uncle, what wood is this?" I cried.</p>

<p id="id01598">"It is fir, pine, or birch, and other northern coniferae, mineralised
by the action of the sea. It is called surturbrand, a variety of
brown coal or lignite, found chiefly in Iceland."</p>

<p id="id01599">"But surely, then, like other fossil wood, it must be as hard as
stone, and cannot float?"</p>

<p id="id01600">"Sometimes that may happen; some of these woods become true
anthracites; but others, such as this, have only gone through the
first stage of fossil transformation. Just look," added my uncle,
throwing into the sea one of those precious waifs.</p>

<p id="id01601">The bit of wood, after disappearing, returned to the surface and
oscillated to and fro with the waves.</p>

<p id="id01602">"Are you convinced?" said my uncle.</p>

<p id="id01603">"I am quite convinced, although it is incredible!"</p>

<p id="id01604">By next evening, thanks to the industry and skill of our guide, the
raft was made. It was ten feet by five; the planks of surturbrand,
braced strongly together with cords, presented an even surface, and
when launched this improvised vessel floated easily upon the waves of
the Liedenbrock Sea.</p>
