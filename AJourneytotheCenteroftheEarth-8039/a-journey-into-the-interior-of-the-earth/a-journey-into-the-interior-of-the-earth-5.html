<h6 id="id01606">WONDERS OF THE DEEP</h6>

<p id="id01607" style="margin-top: 2em">On the 13th of August we awoke early. We were now to begin to adopt a
mode of travelling both more expeditious and less fatiguing than
hitherto.</p>

<p id="id01608">A mast was made of two poles spliced together, a yard was made of a
third, a blanket borrowed from our coverings made a tolerable sail.
There was no want of cordage for the rigging, and everything was well
and firmly made.</p>

<p id="id01609">The provisions, the baggage, the instruments, the guns, and a good
quantity of fresh water from the rocks around, all found their proper
places on board; and at six the Professor gave the signal to embark.
Hans had fitted up a rudder to steer his vessel. He took the tiller,
and unmoored; the sail was set, and we were soon afloat. At the
moment of leaving the harbour, my uncle, who was tenaciously fond of
naming his new discoveries, wanted to give it a name, and proposed
mine amongst others.</p>

<p id="id01610">"But I have a better to propose," I said: "Grauben. Let it be called<br/>

Port Gr&#228;uben; it will look very well upon the map."<br/></p>

<p id="id01611">"Port Gr&#228;uben let it be then."</p>

<p id="id01612">And so the cherished remembrance of my Virlandaise became associated
with our adventurous expedition.</p>

<p id="id01613">The wind was from the north-west. We went with it at a high rate of
speed. The dense atmosphere acted with great force and impelled us
swiftly on.</p>

<p id="id01614">In an hour my uncle had been able to estimate our progress. At this
rate, he said, we shall make thirty leagues in twenty-four hours, and
we shall soon come in sight of the opposite shore.</p>

<p id="id01615">I made no answer, but went and sat forward. The northern shore was
already beginning to dip under the horizon. The eastern and western
strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell. Before our eyes lay far
and wide a vast sea; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its
silver-grey surface; the glistening bluish rays of electric light,
here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray, shot out
little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear. Soon we
entirely lost sight of land; no object was left for the eye to judge
by, and but for the frothy track of the raft, I might have thought we
were standing still.</p>

<p id="id01616">About twelve, immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight. I was aware
of the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants,
which grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet, reproduce themselves
under a pressure of four hundred atmospheres, and sometimes form
barriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship. But never, I
think, were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense
waving lines upon the sea of Liedenbrock.</p>

<p id="id01617">Our raft skirted the whole length of the fuci, three or four thousand
feet long, undulating like vast serpents beyond the reach of sight; I
found some amusement in tracing these endless waves, always thinking
I should come to the end of them, and for hours my patience was vying
with my surprise.</p>

<p id="id01618">What natural force could have produced such plants, and what must
have been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its
formation, when, under the action of heat and moisture, the vegetable
kingdom alone was developing on its surface?</p>

<p id="id01619">Evening came, and, as on the previous day, I perceived no change in
the luminous condition of the air. It was a constant condition, the
permanency of which might be relied upon.</p>

<p id="id01620">After supper I laid myself down at the foot of the mast, and fell
asleep in the midst of fantastic reveries.</p>

<p id="id01621">Hans, keeping fast by the helm, let the raft run on, which, after
all, needed no steering, the wind blowing directly aft.</p>

<p id="id01622">Since our departure from Port Gr&#228;uben, Professor Liedenbrock had
entrusted the log to my care; I was to register every observation,
make entries of interesting phenomena, the direction of the wind, the
rate of sailing, the way we made&#8212;in a word, every particular of our
singular voyage.</p>

<p id="id01623">I shall therefore reproduce here these daily notes, written, so to
speak, as the course of events directed, in order to furnish an exact
narrative of our passage.</p>

<p id="id01624"><i>Friday, August 14</i>.&#8212;Wind steady, N.W. The raft makes rapid way in
a direct line. Coast thirty leagues to leeward. Nothing in sight
before us. Intensity of light the same. Weather fine; that is to say,
that the clouds are flying high, are light, and bathed in a white
atmosphere resembling silver in a state of fusion. Therm. 89&#176; Fahr.</p>

<p id="id01625">At noon Hans prepared a hook at the end of a line. He baited it with
a small piece of meat and flung it into the sea. For two hours
nothing was caught. Are these waters, then, bare of inhabitants? No,
there's a pull at the line. Hans draws it in and brings out a
struggling fish.</p>

<p id="id01626">"A sturgeon," I cried; "a small sturgeon."</p>

<p id="id01627">The Professor eyes the creature attentively, and his opinion differs
from mine.</p>

<p id="id01628">The head of this fish was flat, but rounded in front, and the
anterior part of its body was plated with bony, angular scales; it
had no teeth, its pectoral fins were large, and of tail there was
none. The animal belonged to the same order as the sturgeon, but
differed from that fish in many essential particulars. After a short
examination my uncle pronounced his opinion.</p>

<p id="id01629">"This fish belongs to an extinct family, of which only fossil traces
are found in the devonian formations."</p>

<p id="id01630">"What!" I cried. "Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of
primitive ages?"</p>

<p id="id01631">"Yes; and you will observe that these fossil fishes have no identity
with any living species. To have in one's possession a living
specimen is a happy event for a naturalist."</p>

<p id="id01632">"But to what family does it belong?"</p>

<p id="id01633">"It is of the order of ganoids, of the family of the cephalaspidae;
and a species of pterichthys. But this one displays a peculiarity
confined to all fishes that inhabit subterranean waters. It is blind,
and not only blind, but actually has no eyes at all."</p>

<p id="id01634">I looked: nothing could be more certain. But supposing it might be a
solitary case, we baited afresh, and threw out our line. Surely this
ocean is well peopled with fish, for in another couple of hours we
took a large quantity of pterichthydes, as well as of others
belonging to the extinct family of the dipterides, but of which my
uncle could not tell the species; none had organs of sight. This
unhoped-for catch recruited our stock of provisions.</p>

<p id="id01635">Thus it is evident that this sea contains none but species known to
us in their fossil state, in which fishes as well as reptiles are the
less perfectly and completely organised the farther back their date
of creation.</p>

<p id="id01636">Perhaps we may yet meet with some of those saurians which science has
reconstructed out of a bit of bone or cartilage. I took up the
telescope and scanned the whole horizon, and found it everywhere a
desert sea. We are far away removed from the shores.</p>

<p id="id01637">I gaze upward in the air. Why should not some of the strange birds
restored by the immortal Cuvier again flap their 'sail-broad vans' in
this dense and heavy atmosphere? There are sufficient fish for their
support. I survey the whole space that stretches overhead; it is as
desert as the shore was.</p>

<p id="id01638">Still my imagination carried me away amongst the wonderful
speculations of pal&#230;ontology. Though awake I fell into a dream. I
thought I could see floating on the surface of the waters enormous
chelonia, pre-adamite tortoises, resembling floating islands. Over the
dimly lighted strand there trod the huge mammals of the first ages of
the world, the leptotherium (slender beast), found in the caverns of
Brazil; the merycotherium (ruminating beast), found in the 'drift' of
iceclad Siberia. Farther on, the pachydermatous lophiodon (crested
toothed), a gigantic tapir, hides behind the rocks to dispute its
prey with the anoplotherium (unarmed beast), a strange creature,
which seemed a compound of horse, rhinoceros, camel, and
hippopotamus. The colossal mastodon (nipple-toothed) twists and
untwists his trunk, and brays and pounds with his huge tusks the
fragments of rock that cover the shore; whilst the megatherium (huge
beast), buttressed upon his enormous hinder paws, grubs in the soil,
awaking the sonorous echoes of the granite rocks with his tremendous
roarings. Higher up, the protopitheca&#8212;the first monkey that
appeared on the globe&#8212;is climbing up the steep ascents. Higher yet,
the pterodactyle (wing-fingered) darts in irregular zigzags to and
fro in the heavy air. In the uppermost regions of the air immense
birds, more powerful than the cassowary, and larger than the ostrich,
spread their vast breadth of wings and strike with their heads the
granite vault that bounds the sky.</p>

<p id="id01639">All this fossil world rises to life again in my vivid imagination. I
return to the scriptural periods or ages of the world, conventionally
called 'days,' long before the appearance of man, when the unfinished
world was as yet unfitted for his support. Then my dream backed even
farther still into the ages before the creation of living beings. The
mammals disappear, then the birds vanish, then the reptiles of the
secondary period, and finally the fish, the crustaceans, molluscs,
and articulated beings. Then the zoophytes of the transition period
also return to nothing. I am the only living thing in the world: all
life is concentrated in my beating heart alone. There are no more
seasons; climates are no more; the heat of the globe continually
increases and neutralises that of the sun. Vegetation becomes
accelerated. I glide like a shade amongst arborescent ferns, treading
with unsteady feet the coloured marls and the particoloured clays; I
lean for support against the trunks of immense conifers; I lie in the
shade of sphenophylla (wedge-leaved), asterophylla (star-leaved), and
lycopods, a hundred feet high.</p>

<p id="id01640">Ages seem no more than days! I am passed, against my will, in
retrograde order, through the long series of terrestrial changes.
Plants disappear; granite rocks soften; intense heat converts solid
bodies into thick fluids; the waters again cover the face of the
earth; they boil, they rise in whirling eddies of steam; white and
ghastly mists wrap round the shifting forms of the earth, which by
imperceptible degrees dissolves into a gaseous mass, glowing fiery
red and white, as large and as shining as the sun.</p>

<p id="id01641">And I myself am floating with wild caprice in the midst of this
nebulous mass of fourteen hundred thousand times the volume of the
earth into which it will one day be condensed, and carried forward
amongst the planetary bodies. My body is no longer firm and
terrestrial; it is resolved into its constituent atoms, subtilised,
volatilised. Sublimed into imponderable vapour, I mingle and am lost
in the endless foods of those vast globular volumes of vaporous
mists, which roll upon their flaming orbits through infinite space.</p>

<p id="id01642">But is it not a dream? Whither is it carrying me? My feverish hand
has vainly attempted to describe upon paper its strange and wonderful
details. I have forgotten everything that surrounds me. The
Professor, the guide, the raft&#8212;are all gone out of my ken. An
illusion has laid hold upon me.</p>

<p id="id01643">"What is the matter?" my uncle breaks in.</p>

<p id="id01644">My staring eyes are fixed vacantly upon him.</p>

<p id="id01645">"Take care, Axel, or you will fall overboard."</p>

<p id="id01646">At that moment I felt the sinewy hand of Hans seizing me vigorously.
But for him, carried away by my dream, I should have thrown myself
into the sea.</p>

<p id="id01647">"Is he mad?" cried the Professor.</p>

<p id="id01648">"What is it all about?" at last I cried, returning to myself.</p>

<p id="id01649">"Do you feel ill?" my uncle asked.</p>

<p id="id01650">"No; but I have had a strange hallucination; it is over now. Is all
going on right?"</p>

<p id="id01651">"Yes, it is a fair wind and a fine sea; we are sailing rapidly along,
and if I am not out in my reckoning, we shall soon land."</p>

<p id="id01652">At these words I rose and gazed round upon the horizon, still
everywhere bounded by clouds alone.</p>

<h2 id="id01653" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<h6 id="id01654">A BATTLE OF MONSTERS</h6>

<p id="id01655" style="margin-top: 2em"><i>Saturday, August 15</i>.&#8212;The sea unbroken all round. No land in
sight. The horizon seems extremely distant.</p>

<p id="id01656">My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.</p>

<p id="id01657">My uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper. He examines the
horizon all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of
an injured man.</p>

<p id="id01658">I remark that Professor Liedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an
impatient mood, and I make a note of it in my log. All my danger and
sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of
him; but now that I am well his nature has resumed its sway. And yet,
what cause was there for anger? Is not the voyage prospering as
favourably as possible under the circumstances? Is not the raft
spinning along with marvellous speed?</p>

<p id="id01659">"-You seem anxious, my uncle," I said, seeing him continually with
his glass to his eye.</p>

<p id="id01660">"Anxious! No, not at all."</p>

<p id="id01661">"Impatient, then?"</p>

<p id="id01662">"One might be, with less reason than now."</p>

<p id="id01663">"Yet we are going very fast."</p>

<p id="id01664">"What does that signify? I am not complaining that the rate is slow,
but that the sea is so wide."</p>

<p id="id01665">I then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated
the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues. Now we had made
three times the distance, yet still the southern coast was not in
sight.</p>

<p id="id01666">"We are not descending as we ought to be," the Professor declares.
"We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to
take a little sail upon a pond on a raft."</p>

<p id="id01667">He called this sea a pond, and our long voyage, taking a little sail!</p>

<p id="id01668">"But," I remarked, "since we have followed the road that Saknussemm
has shown us&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id01669">"That is just the question. Have we followed that road? Did
Saknussemm meet this sheet of water? Did he cross it? Has not the
stream that we followed led us altogether astray?"</p>

<p id="id01670">"At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far. This prospect
is magnificent, and&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id01671">"But I don't care for prospects. I came with an object, and I mean to
attain it. Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects."</p>

<p id="id01672">I take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips
with impatience. At six in the evening Hans asks for his wages, and
his three rix dollars are counted out to him.</p>

<p id="id01673"><i>Sunday, August 16. </i>&#8212;Nothing new. Weather unchanged. The wind
freshens. On awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity
of the light. I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric
light should grow dim, or fail altogether. But there seemed no reason
to fear. The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface
of the waves.</p>

<p id="id01674">Truly this sea is of infinite width. It must be as wide as the<br/>

Mediterranean or the Atlantic&#8212;and why not?<br/></p>

<p id="id01675">My uncle took soundings several times. He tied the heaviest of our
pickaxes to a long rope which he let down two hundred fathoms. No
bottom yet; and we had some difficulty in hauling up our plummet.</p>

<p id="id01676">But when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface
deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard
bodies.</p>

<p id="id01677">I looked at the hunter.</p>

<p id="id01678">"<i>T&#228;nder,</i>" said he.</p>

<p id="id01679">I could not understand him, and turned to my uncle who was entirely
absorbed in his calculations. I had rather not disturb him while he
is quiet. I return to the Icelander. He by a snapping motion of his
jaws conveys his ideas to me.</p>

<p id="id01680">"Teeth!" I cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.</p>

<p id="id01681">Yes, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal!
The jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength. Is
there some monster beneath us belonging to the extinct races, more
voracious than the shark, more fearful in vastness than the whale? I
could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar. Surely will my
last night's dream be realised?</p>

<p id="id01682">These thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely
calmed down after several hours' sleep.</p>

<p id="id01683"><i>Monday, August 17.&#8212;</i> I am trying to recall the peculiar instincts
of the monsters of the pre-adamite world, who, coming next in
succession after the molluscs, the crustaceans and le fishes,
preceded the animals of mammalian race upon the earth. The world then
belonged to reptiles. Those monsters held the mastery in the seas of
the secondary period. They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic
proportions, prodigious strength. The saurians of our day, the
alligators and the crocodiles, are but feeble reproductions of their
forefathers of primitive ages.</p>

<p id="id01684">I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance. No human eye
has ever beheld them living. They burdened this earth a thousand ages
before man appeared, but their fossil remains, found in the
argillaceous limestone called by the English the lias, have enabled
their colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and
anatomically ascertained.</p>

<p id="id01685">I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures
thirty feet in length. Am I then fated&#8212;I, a denizen of earth&#8212;to
be placed face to face with these representatives of long extinct
families? No; surely it cannot be! Yet the deep marks of conical
teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.</p>

<p id="id01686">My eyes are fearfully bent upon the sea. I dread to see one of these
monsters darting forth from its submarine caverns. I suppose
Professor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my
fears, for after having examined the pick, his eyes traversed the
ocean from side to side. What a very bad notion that was of his, I
thought to myself, to take soundings just here! He has disturbed some
monstrous beast in its remote den, and if we are not attacked on our
voyage&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01687">I look at our guns and see that they are all right. My uncle notices
it, and looks on approvingly.</p>

<p id="id01688">Already widely disturbed regions on the surface of the water indicate
some commotion below. The danger is approaching. We must be on the
look out.</p>

<p id="id01689"><i>Tuesday, August 18. </i>&#8212;Evening came, or rather the time came when
sleep weighs down the weary eyelids, for there is no night here, and
the ceaseless light wearies the eyes with its persistency just as if
we were sailing under an arctic sun. Hans was at the helm. During his
watch I slept.</p>

<p id="id01690">Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me. The raft was heaved
up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of
twenty fathoms.</p>

<p id="id01691">"What is the matter?" shouted my uncle. "Have we struck land?"</p>

<p id="id01692">Hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away,
rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges. I looked and cried:</p>

<p id="id01693">"It is an enormous porpoise."</p>

<p id="id01694">"Yes," replied my uncle, "and there is a sea lizard of vast size."</p>

<p id="id01695">"And farther on a monstrous crocodile. Look at its vast jaws and its
rows of teeth! It is diving down!"</p>

<p id="id01696">"There's a whale, a whale!" cried the Professor. "I can see its great
fins. See how he is throwing out air and water through his blowers."</p>

<p id="id01697">And in fact two liquid columns were rising to a considerable height
above the sea. We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of
such a herd of marine monsters. They were of supernatural dimensions;
the smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at
one snap of its huge jaws.</p>

<p id="id01698">Hans wants to tack to get away from this dangerous neighbourhood; but
he sees on the other hand enemies not less terrible; a tortoise forty
feet long, and a serpent of thirty, lifting its fearful head and
gleaming eyes above the flood.</p>

<p id="id01699">Flight was out of the question now. The reptiles rose; they wheeled
around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express
trains. They described around us gradually narrowing circles. I took
up my rifle. But what could a ball do against the scaly armour with
which these enormous beasts were clad?</p>

<p id="id01700">We stood dumb with fear. They approach us close: on one side the
crocodile, on the other the serpent. The remainder of the sea
monsters have disappeared. I prepare to fire. Hans stops me by a
gesture. The two monsters pass within a hundred and fifty yards of
the raft, and hurl themselves the one upon the other, with a fury
which prevents them from seeing us.</p>

<p id="id01701">At three hundred yards from us the battle was fought. We could
distinctly observe the two monsters engaged in deadly conflict. But
it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the
fray&#8212;the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise. Every
moment I seem to see one or other of them. I point them to the
Icelander. He shakes his head negatively.</p>

<p id="id01702">"<i>Tva,</i>" says he.</p>

<p id="id01703">"What two? Does he mean that there are only two animals?"</p>

<p id="id01704">"He is right," said my uncle, whose glass has never left his eye.</p>

<p id="id01705">"Surely you must be mistaken," I cried.</p>

<p id="id01706">"No: the first of those monsters has a porpoise's snout, a lizard's
head, a crocodile's teeth; and hence our mistake. It is the
ichthyosaurus (the fish lizard), the most terrible of the ancient
monsters of the deep."</p>

<p id="id01707">"And the other?"</p>

<p id="id01708">"The other is a plesiosaurus (almost lizard), a serpent, armoured
with the carapace and the paddles of a turtle; he is the dreadful
enemy of the other."</p>

<p id="id01709">Hans had spoken truly. Two monsters only were creating all this
commotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive
world. I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a
red-hot coal, and as large as a man's head. Nature has endowed it
with an optical apparatus of extreme power, and capable of resisting
the pressure of the great volume of water in the depths it inhabits.
It has been appropriately called the saurian whale, for it has both
the swiftness and the rapid movements of this monster of our own day.
This one is not less than a hundred feet long, and I can judge of its
size when it sweeps over the waters the vertical coils of its tail.
Its jaw is enormous, and according to naturalists it is armed with no
less than one hundred and eighty-two teeth.</p>

<p id="id01710">The plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail,
has four flappers or paddles to act like oars. Its body is entirely
covered with a thick armour of scales, and its neck, as flexible as a
swan's, rises thirty feet above the waves.</p>

<p id="id01711">Those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity.
They heaved around them liquid mountains, which rolled even to our
raft and rocked it perilously. Twenty times we were near capsizing.
Hissings of prodigious force are heard. The two beasts are fast
locked together; I cannot distinguish the one from the other. The
probable rage of the conqueror inspires us with intense fear.</p>

<p id="id01712">One hour, two hours, pass away. The struggle continues with unabated
ferocity. The combatants alternately approach and recede from our
raft. We remain motionless, ready to fire. Suddenly the ichthyosaurus
and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in
the water. Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under
water.</p>

<p id="id01713">All at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the
plesiosaurus. The monster is wounded to death. I no longer see his
scaly armour. Only his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and
uncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes
like a worm that you tread on. The water is splashed for a long way
around. The spray almost blinds us. But soon the reptile's agony
draws to an end; its movements become fainter, its contortions cease
to be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on
the labouring deep.</p>

<p id="id01714">As for the ichthyosaurus&#8212;has he returned to his submarine cavern?
or will he reappear on the surface of the sea?</p>

<h2 id="id01715" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h6 id="id01716">THE GREAT GEYSER</h6>

<p id="id01717" style="margin-top: 2em"><i>Wednesday, August 19</i>.&#8212;Fortunately the wind blows violently, and
has enabled us to flee from the scene of the late terrible struggle.
Hans keeps at his post at the helm. My uncle, whom the absorbing
incidents of the combat had drawn away from his contemplations, began
again to look impatiently around him.</p>

<p id="id01718">The voyage resumes its uniform tenor, which I don't care to break
with a repetition of such events as yesterday's.</p>

<p id="id01719">Thursday, Aug. 20.&#8212;Wind N.N.E., unsteady and fitful. Temperature
high. Rate three and a half leagues an hour.</p>

<p id="id01720">About noon a distant noise is heard. I note the fact without being
able to explain it. It is a continuous roar.</p>

<p id="id01721">"In the distance," says the Professor, "there is a rock or islet,
against which the sea is breaking."</p>

<p id="id01722">Hans climbs up the mast, but sees no breakers. The ocean' is smooth
and unbroken to its farthest limit.</p>

<p id="id01723">Three hours pass away. The roarings seem to proceed from a very
distant waterfall.</p>

<p id="id01724">I remark upon this to my uncle, who replies doubtfully: "Yes, I am
convinced that I am right." Are we, then, speeding forward to some
cataract which will cast us down an abyss? This method of getting on
may please the Professor, because it is vertical; but for my part I
prefer the more ordinary modes of horizontal progression.</p>

<p id="id01725">At any rate, some leagues to the windward there must be some noisy
phenomenon, for now the roarings are heard with increasing loudness.
Do they proceed from the sky or the ocean?</p>

<p id="id01726">I look up to the atmospheric vapours, and try to fathom their depths.
The sky is calm and motionless. The clouds have reached the utmost
limit of the lofty vault, and there lie still bathed in the bright
glare of the electric light. It is not there that we must seek for
the cause of this phenomenon. Then I examine the horizon, which is
unbroken and clear of all mist. There is no change in its aspect. But
if this noise arises from a fall, a cataract, if all this ocean flows
away headlong into a lower basin yet, if that deafening roar is
produced by a mass of falling water, the current must needs
accelerate, and its increasing speed will give me the measure of the
peril that threatens us. I consult the current: there is none. I
throw an empty bottle into the sea: it lies still.</p>

<p id="id01727">About four Hans rises, lays hold of the mast, climbs to its top.
Thence his eye sweeps a large area of sea, and it is fixed upon a
point. His countenance exhibits no surprise, but his eye is immovably
steady.</p>

<p id="id01728">"He sees something," says my uncle.</p>

<p id="id01729">"I believe he does."</p>

<p id="id01730">Hans comes down, then stretches his arm to the south, saying:</p>

<p id="id01731">"<i>Dere nere!</i>"</p>

<p id="id01732">"Down there?" repeated my uncle.</p>

<p id="id01733">Then, seizing his glass, he gazes attentively for a minute, which
seems to me an age.</p>

<p id="id01734">"Yes, yes!" he cried. "I see a vast inverted cone rising from the
surface."</p>

<p id="id01735">"Is it another sea beast?"</p>

<p id="id01736">"Perhaps it is."</p>

<p id="id01737">"Then let us steer farther westward, for we know something of the
danger of coming across monsters of that sort."</p>

<p id="id01738">"Let us go straight on," replied my uncle.</p>

<p id="id01739">I appealed to Hans. He maintained his course inflexibly.</p>

<p id="id01740">Yet, if at our present distance from the animal, a distance of twelve
leagues at the least, the column of water driven through its blowers
may be distinctly seen, it must needs be of vast size. The commonest
prudence would counsel immediate flight; but we did not come so far
to be prudent.</p>

<p id="id01741">Imprudently, therefore, we pursue our way. The nearer we approach,
the higher mounts the jet of water. What monster can possibly fill
itself with such a quantity of water, and spurt it up so continuously?</p>

<p id="id01742">At eight in the evening we are not two leagues distant from it. Its
body&#8212;dusky, enormous, hillocky&#8212;lies spread upon the sea like an
islet. Is it illusion or fear? Its length seems to me a couple of
thousand yards. What can be this cetacean, which neither Cuvier nor
Blumenbach knew anything about? It lies motionless, as if asleep; the
sea seems unable to move it in the least; it is the waves that
undulate upon its sides. The column of water thrown up to a height of
five hundred feet falls in rain with a deafening uproar. And here are
we scudding like lunatics before the wind, to get near to a monster
that a hundred whales a day would not satisfy!</p>

<p id="id01743">Terror seizes upon me. I refuse to go further. I will cut the
halliards if necessary! I am in open mutiny against the Professor,
who vouchsafes no answer.</p>

<p id="id01744">Suddenly Hans rises, and pointing with his finger at the menacing
object, he says:</p>

<p id="id01745">"<i>Holm.</i>"</p>

<p id="id01746">"An island!" cries my uncle.</p>

<p id="id01747">"That's not an island!" I cried sceptically.</p>

<p id="id01748">"It's nothing else," shouted the Professor, with a loud laugh.</p>

<p id="id01749">"But that column of water?"</p>

<p id="id01750">"<i>Geyser,</i>" said Hans.</p>

<p id="id01751">"No doubt it is a geyser, like those in Iceland."</p>

<p id="id01752">At first I protest against being so widely mistaken as to have taken
an island for a marine monster. But the evidence is against me, and I
have to confess my error. It is nothing worse than a natural
phenomenon.</p>

<p id="id01753">As we approach nearer the dimensions of the liquid column become
magnificent. The islet resembles, with a most deceiving likeness, an
enormous cetacean, whose head dominates the waves at a height of
twenty yards. The geyser, a word meaning 'fury,' rises majestically
from its extremity. Deep and heavy explosions are heard from time to
time, when the enormous jet, possessed with more furious violence,
shakes its plumy crest, and springs with a bound till it reaches the
lowest stratum of the clouds. It stands alone. No steam vents, no hot
springs surround it, and all the volcanic power of the region is
concentrated here. Sparks of electric fire mingle with the dazzling
sheaf of lighted fluid, every drop of which refracts the prismatic
colours.</p>

<p id="id01754">"Let us land," said the Professor.</p>

<p id="id01755">"But we must carefully avoid this waterspout, which would sink our
raft in a moment."</p>

<p id="id01756">Hans, steering with his usual skill, brought us to the other
extremity of the islet.</p>

<p id="id01757">I leaped up on the rock; my uncle lightly followed, while our hunter
remained at his post, like a man too wise ever to be astonished.</p>

<p id="id01758">We walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa. The soil shivers
and shakes under our feet, like the sides of an overheated boiler
filled with steam struggling to get loose. We come in sight of a
small central basin, out of which the geyser springs. I plunge a
register thermometer into the boiling water. It marks an intense heat
of 325&#176;, which is far above the boiling point; therefore this water
issues from an ardent furnace, which is not at all in harmony with
Professor Liedenbrock's theories. I cannot help making the remark.</p>

<p id="id01759">"Well," he replied, "how does that make against my doctrine?"</p>

<p id="id01760">"Oh, nothing at all," I said, seeing that I was going in opposition
to immovable obstinacy.</p>

<p id="id01761">Still I am constrained to confess that hitherto we have been
wonderfully favoured, and that for some reason unknown to myself we
have accomplished our journey under singularly favourable conditions
of temperature. But it seems manifest to me that some day we shall
reach a region where the central heat attains its highest limits, and
goes beyond a point that can be registered by our thermometers.</p>

<p id="id01762">"That is what we shall see." So says the Professor, who, having named
this volcanic islet after his nephew, gives the signal to embark
again.</p>

<p id="id01763">For some minutes I am still contemplating the geyser. I notice that
it throws up its column of water with variable force: sometimes
sending it to a great height, then again to a lower, which I
attribute to the variable pressure of the steam accumulated in its
reservoir.</p>

<p id="id01764">At last we leave the island, rounding away past the low rocks on its
southern shore. Hans has taken advantage of the halt to refit his
rudder.</p>

<p id="id01765">But before going any farther I make a few observations, to calculate
the distance we have gone over, and note them in my journal. We have
crossed two hundred and seventy leagues of sea since leaving Port
Gr&#228;uben; and we are six hundred and twenty leagues from Iceland,
under England. [1]</p>

<p id="id01766">[1] This distance carries the travellers as far as under the Pyrenees
if the league measures three miles. (Trans.)</p>

<h2 id="id01767" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h6 id="id01768">AN ELECTRIC STORM</h6>

<p id="id01769" style="margin-top: 2em"><i>Friday, August 21</i>.&#8212;On the morrow the magnificent geyser has
disappeared. The wind has risen, and has rapidly carried us away from
Axel Island. The roarings become lost in the distance.</p>

<p id="id01770">The weather&#8212;if we may use that term&#8212;will change before long. The
atmosphere is charged with vapours, pervaded with the electricity
generated by the evaporation of saline waters. The clouds are sinking
lower, and assume an olive hue. The electric light can scarcely
penetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the
theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.</p>

<p id="id01771">I feel peculiar sensations, like many creatures on earth at the
approach of violent atmospheric changes. The heavily voluted cumulus
clouds lower gloomily and threateningly; they wear that implacable
look which I have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm.
The air is heavy; the sea is calm.</p>

<p id="id01772">In the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton, piled up
in picturesque disorder. By degrees they dilate, and gain in huge
size what they lose in number. Such is their ponderous weight that
they cannot rise from the horizon; but, obeying an impulse from
higher currents, their dense consistency slowly yields. The gloom
upon them deepens; and they soon present to our view a ponderous mass
of almost level surface. From time to time a fleecy tuft of mist,
with yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense
floor of grey, and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass.</p>

<p id="id01773">The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity.
My whole body is saturated; my hair bristles just as when you stand
upon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine. It
seems to me as if my companions, the moment they touched me, would
receive a severe shock like that from an electric eel.</p>

<p id="id01774">At ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated. The
wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength; the vast bank of
heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing
storms.</p>

<p id="id01775">I am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces, and yet I cannot help
muttering:</p>

<p id="id01776">"Here's some very bad weather coming on."</p>

<p id="id01777">The Professor made no answer. His temper is awful, to judge from the
working of his features, as he sees this vast length of ocean
unrolling before him to an indefinite extent. He can only spare time
to shrug his shoulders viciously.</p>

<p id="id01778">"There's a heavy storm coming on," I cried, pointing towards the
horizon. "Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea."</p>

<p id="id01779">A deep silence falls on all around. The lately roaring winds are
hushed into a dead calm; nature seems to breathe no more, and to be
sinking into the stillness of death. On the mast already I see the
light play of a lambent St. Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail
catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead. The
rudder stands motionless in a sluggish, waveless sea. But if we have
now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose, which at
the first shock of the tempest may capsize us in a moment?</p>

<p id="id01780">"Let us reef the sail and cut the mast down!" I cried. "That will be
safest."</p>

<p id="id01781">"No, no! Never!" shouted my impetuous uncle. "Never! Let the wind
catch us if it will! What I want is to get the least glimpse of rock
or shore, even if our raft should be smashed into shivers!"</p>

<p id="id01782">The words were hardly out of his mouth when a sudden change took
place in the southern sky. The piled-up vapours condense into water;
and the air, put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the
condensation of the mists, rouses itself into a whirlwind. It rushes
on from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern. The darkness
deepens; scarcely can I jot down a few hurried notes. The helm makes
a bound. My uncle falls full length; I creep close to him. He has
laid a firm hold upon a rope, and appears to watch with grim
satisfaction this awful display of elemental strife.</p>

<p id="id01783">Hans stirs not. His long hair blown by the pelting storm, and laid
flat across his immovable countenance, makes him a strange figure;
for the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little
luminous radiations. This frightful mask of electric sparks suggests
to me, even in this dizzy excitement, a comparison with pre-adamite
man, the contemporary of the ichthyosaurus and the megatherium. [1]</p>

<p id="id01784">[1] Rather of the mammoth and the mastodon. (Trans.)</p>

<p id="id01785">The mast yet holds firm. The sail stretches tight like a bubble ready
to burst. The raft flies at a rate that I cannot reckon, but not so
fast as the foaming clouds of spray which it dashes from side to side
in its headlong speed.</p>

<p id="id01786">"The sail! the sail!" I cry, motioning to lower it.</p>

<p id="id01787">"No!" replies my uncle.</p>

<p id="id01788">"<i>Nej!</i>" repeats Hans, leisurely shaking his head.</p>

<p id="id01789">But now the rain forms a rushing cataract in front of that horizon
toward which we are running with such maddening speed. But before it
has reached us the rain cloud parts asunder, the sea boils, and the
electric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical
power that descends from the higher regions. The most vivid flashes
of lightning are mingled with the violent crash of continuous
thunder. Ceaseless fiery arrows dart in and out amongst the flying
thunder-clouds; the vaporous mass soon glows with incandescent heat;
hailstones rattle fiercely down, and as they dash upon our iron tools
they too emit gleams and flashes of lurid light. The heaving waves
resemble fiery volcanic hills, each belching forth its own interior
flames, and every crest is plumed with dancing fire. My eyes fail
under the dazzling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant
crash of thunder. I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed
before the mighty strength of the storm.</p>

<p id="id01790">(Here my notes become vague and indistinct. I have only been able to
find a few which I seem to have jotted down almost unconsciously. But
their very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the
excitement which dominated me, and describe the actual position even
better than my memory could do.)</p>

<p id="id01791">Sunday, 23.&#8212;Where are we? Driven forward with a swiftness that
cannot be measured.</p>

<p id="id01792">The night was fearful; no abatement of the storm. The din and uproar
are incessant; our ears are bleeding; to exchange a word is
impossible.</p>

<p id="id01793">The lightning flashes with intense brilliancy, and never seems to
cease for a moment. Zigzag streams of bluish white fire dash down
upon the sea and rebound, and then take an upward flight till they
strike the granite vault that overarches our heads. Suppose that
solid roof should crumble down upon our heads! Other flashes with
incessant play cross their vivid fires, while others again roll
themselves into balls of living fire which explode like bombshells,
but the music of which scarcely-adds to the din of the battle strife
that almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight; the limit
of intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can
distinguish one sound from another. If all the powder magazines in
the world were to explode at once, we should hear no more than we do
now.</p>

<p id="id01794">From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of
lurid light; electric matter is in continual evolution from their
component molecules; the gaseous elements of the air need to be
slaked with moisture; for innumerable columns of water rush upwards
into the air and fall back again in white foam.</p>

<p id="id01795">Whither are we flying? My uncle lies full length across the raft.</p>

<p id="id01796">The heat increases. I refer to the thermometer; it indicates . . .
(the figure is obliterated).</p>

<p id="id01797"><i>Monday, August 24.</i>&#8212;Will there be an end to it? Is the atmospheric
condition, having once reached this density, to become final?</p>

<p id="id01798">We are prostrated and worn out with fatigue. But Hans is as usual.
The raft bears on still to the south-east. We have made two hundred
leagues since we left Axel Island.</p>

<p id="id01799">At noon the violence of the storm redoubles. We are obliged to secure
as fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo. Each of
us is lashed to some part of the raft. The waves rise above our heads.</p>

<p id="id01800">For three days we have never been able to make each other hear a
word. Our mouths open, our lips move, but not a word can be heard. We
cannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to
the ear.</p>

<p id="id01801">My uncle has drawn nearer to me. He has uttered a few words. They
seem to be 'We are lost'; but I am not sure.</p>

<p id="id01802">At last I write down the words: "Let us lower the sail."</p>

<p id="id01803">He nods his consent.</p>

<p id="id01804">Scarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has
bounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft. Mast and sail
flew up in an instant together, and I saw them carried up to
prodigious height, resembling in appearance a pterodactyle, one of
those strong birds of the infant world.</p>

<p id="id01805">We lay there, our blood running cold with unspeakable terror. The
fireball, half of it white, half azure blue, and the size of a
ten-inch shell, moved slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own
axis with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of
the whirlwind. Here it comes, there it glides, now it is up the
ragged stump of the mast, thence it lightly leaps on the provision
bag, descends with a light bound, and just skims the powder magazine.
Horrible! we shall be blown up; but no, the dazzling disk of
mysterious light nimbly leaps aside; it approaches Hans, who fixes
his blue eye upon it steadily; it threatens the head of my uncle, who
falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it. And now my turn
comes; pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the
melting heat, it drops at my feet, spinning silently round upon the
deck; I try to move my foot away, but cannot.</p>

<p id="id01806">A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat,
it fills the lungs. We suffer stifling pains.</p>

<p id="id01807">Why am I unable to move my foot? Is it riveted to the planks? Alas!
the fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised
every iron article on board. The instruments, the tools, our guns,
are clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each
other; the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let
into the timbers, and I cannot draw my foot away from the spot. At
last by a violent effort I release myself at the instant when the
ball in its gyrations was about to seize upon it, and carry me off my
feet &#8230;.</p>

<p id="id01808">Ah! what a flood of intense and dazzling light! the globe has burst,
and we are deluged with tongues of fire!</p>

<p id="id01809">Then all the light disappears. I could just see my uncle at full
length on the raft, and Hans still at his helm and spitting fire
under the action of the electricity which has saturated him.</p>

<p id="id01810">But where are we going to? Where?</p>

<p id="id01811">* * * *</p>

<p id="id01812"><i>Tuesday, August 25.</i>&#8212;I recover from a long swoon. The storm
continues to roar and rage; the lightnings dash hither and thither,
like broods of fiery serpents filling all the air. Are we still under
the sea? Yes, we are borne at incalculable speed. We have been
carried under England, under the channel, under France, perhaps under
the whole of Europe.</p>

<p id="id01813">* * * *</p>

<p id="id01814">A fresh noise is heard! Surely it is the sea breaking upon the rocks!<br/>

But then . . . .<br/></p>

<h2 id="id01815" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<h6 id="id01816">CALM PHILOSOPHIC DISCUSSIONS</h6>

<p id="id01817" style="margin-top: 2em">Here I end what I may call my log, happily saved from the wreck, and<br/>

I resume my narrative as before.<br/></p>

<p id="id01818">What happened when the raft was dashed upon the rocks is more than I
can tell. I felt myself hurled into the waves; and if I escaped from
death, and if my body was not torn over the sharp edges of the rocks,
it was because the powerful arm of Hans came to my rescue.</p>

<p id="id01819">The brave Icelander carried me out of the reach of the waves, over a
burning sand where I found myself by the side of my uncle.</p>

<p id="id01820">Then he returned to the rocks, against which the furious waves were
beating, to save what he could. I was unable to speak. I was
shattered with fatigue and excitement; I wanted a whole hour to
recover even a little.</p>

<p id="id01821">But a deluge of rain was still falling, though with that violence
which generally denotes the near cessation of a storm. A few
overhanging rocks afforded us some shelter from the storm. Hans
prepared some food, which I could not touch; and each of us,
exhausted with three sleepless nights, fell into a broken and painful
sleep.</p>

<p id="id01822">The next day the weather was splendid. The sky and the sea had sunk
into sudden repose. Every trace of the awful storm had disappeared.
The exhilarating voice of the Professor fell upon my ears as I awoke;
he was ominously cheerful.</p>

<p id="id01823">"Well, my boy," he cried, "have you slept well?"</p>

<p id="id01824">Would not any one have thought that we were still in our cheerful
little house on the K&#246;nigstrasse and that I was only just coming down
to breakfast, and that I was to be married to Gr&#228;uben that day?</p>

<p id="id01825">Alas! if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east, we
should have passed under Germany, under my beloved town of Hamburg,
under the very street where dwelt all that I loved most in the world.
Then only forty leagues would have separated us! But they were forty
leagues perpendicular of solid granite wall, and in reality we were a
thousand leagues asunder!</p>

<p id="id01826">All these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before I could
answer my uncle's question.</p>

<p id="id01827">"Well, now," he repeated, "won't you tell me how you have slept?"</p>

<p id="id01828">"Oh, very well," I said. "I am only a little knocked up, but I shall
soon be better."</p>

<p id="id01829">"Oh," says my uncle, "that's nothing to signify. You are only a
little bit tired."</p>

<p id="id01830">"But you, uncle, you seem in very good spirits this morning."</p>

<p id="id01831">"Delighted, my boy, delighted. We have got there."</p>

<p id="id01832">"To our journey's end?"</p>

<p id="id01833">"No; but we have got to the end of that endless sea. Now we shall go
by land, and really begin to go down! down! down!"</p>

<p id="id01834">"But, my dear uncle, do let me ask you one question."</p>

<p id="id01835">"Of course, Axel."</p>

<p id="id01836">"How about returning?"</p>

<p id="id01837">"Returning? Why, you are talking about the return before the arrival."</p>

<p id="id01838">"No, I only want to know how that is to be managed."</p>

<p id="id01839">"In the simplest way possible. When we have reached the centre of the
globe, either we shall find some new way to get back, or we shall
come back like decent folks the way we came. I feel pleased at the
thought that it is sure not to be shut against us."</p>

<p id="id01840">"But then we shall have to refit the raft."</p>

<p id="id01841">"Of course."</p>

<p id="id01842">"Then, as to provisions, have we enough to last?"</p>

<p id="id01843">"Yes; to be sure we have. Hans is a clever fellow, and I am sure he
must have saved a large part of our cargo. But still let us go and
make sure."</p>

<p id="id01844">We left this grotto which lay open to every wind. At the same time I
cherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well. It seemed to me
impossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have
destroyed everything on board. On my arrival on the shore I found
Hans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good
order. My uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude. This
man, with almost superhuman devotion, had been at work all the while
that we were asleep, and had saved the most precious of the articles
at the risk of his life.</p>

<p id="id01845">Not that we had suffered no losses. For instance, our firearms; but
we might do without them. Our stock of powder had remained uninjured
after having risked blowing up during the storm.</p>

<p id="id01846">"Well," cried the Professor, "as we have no guns we cannot hunt,
that's all."</p>

<p id="id01847">"Yes, but how about the instruments?"</p>

<p id="id01848">"Here is the aneroid, the most useful of all, and for which I would
have given all the others. By means of it I can calculate the depth
and know when we have reached the centre; without it we might very
likely go beyond, and come out at the antipodes!"</p>

<p id="id01849">Such high spirits as these were rather too strong.</p>

<p id="id01850">"But where is the compass? I asked.</p>

<p id="id01851">"Here it is, upon this rock, in perfect condition, as well as the
thermometers and the chronometer. The hunter is a splendid fellow."</p>

<p id="id01852">There was no denying it. We had all our instruments. As for tools and
appliances, there they all lay on the ground&#8212;ladders, ropes, picks,
spades, etc.</p>

<p id="id01853">Still there was the question of provisions to be settled, and I
asked&#8212;"How are we off for provisions?"</p>

<p id="id01854">The boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore, in a
perfect state of preservation; for the most part the sea had spared
them, and what with biscuits, salt meat, spirits, and salt fish, we
might reckon on four months' supply.</p>

<p id="id01855">"Four months!" cried the Professor. "We have time to go and to
return; and with what is left I will give a grand dinner to my
friends at the Johann&#230;um."</p>

<p id="id01856">I ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle's
ways; yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me.</p>

<p id="id01857">"Now," said he, "we will replenish our supply of water with the rain
which the storm has left in all these granite basins; therefore we
shall have no reason to fear anything from thirst. As for the raft, I
will recommend Hans to do his best to repair it, although I don't
expect it will be of any further use to us."</p>

<p id="id01858">"How so?" I cried.</p>

<p id="id01859">"An idea of my own, my lad. I don't think we shall come out by the
way that we went in."</p>

<p id="id01860">I stared at the Professor with a good deal of mistrust. I asked, was
he not touched in the brain? And yet there was method in his madness.</p>

<p id="id01861">"And now let us go to breakfast," said he.</p>

<p id="id01862">I followed him to a headland, after he had given his instructions to
the hunter. There preserved meat, biscuit, and tea made us an
excellent meal, one of the best I ever remember. Hunger, the fresh
air, the calm quiet weather, after the commotions we had gone
through, all contributed to give me a good appetite.</p>

<p id="id01863">Whilst breakfasting I took the opportunity to put to my uncle the
question where we were now.</p>

<p id="id01864">"That seems to me," I said, "rather difficult to make out."</p>

<p id="id01865">"Yes, it is difficult," he said, "to calculate exactly; perhaps even
impossible, since during these three stormy days I have been unable
to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft; but still
we may get an approximation."</p>

<p id="id01866">"The last observation," I remarked, "was made on the island, when the
geyser was&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id01867">"You mean Axel Island. Don't decline the honour of having given your
name to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the
globe."</p>

<p id="id01868">"Well," said I, "let it be Axel Island. Then we had cleared two
hundred and seventy leagues of sea, and we were six hundred leagues
from Iceland."</p>

<p id="id01869">"Very well," answered my uncle; "let us start from that point and
count four days' storm, during which our rate cannot have been less
than eighty leagues in the twenty-four hours."</p>

<p id="id01870">"That is right; and this would make three hundred leagues more."</p>

<p id="id01871">"Yes, and the Liedenbrock sea would be six hundred leagues from shore
to shore. Surely, Axel, it may vie in size with the Mediterranean
itself."</p>

<p id="id01872">"Especially," I replied, "if it happens that we have only crossed it
in its narrowest part. And it is a curious circumstance," I added,
"that if my computations are right, and we are nine hundred leagues
from Rejkiavik, we have now the Mediterranean above our head."</p>

<p id="id01873">"That is a good long way, my friend. But whether we are under Turkey
or the Atlantic depends very much upon the question in what direction
we have been moving. Perhaps we have deviated."</p>

<p id="id01874">"No, I think not. Our course has been the same all along, and I
believe this shore is south-east of Port Gr&#228;uben."</p>

<p id="id01875">"Well," replied my uncle, "we may easily ascertain this by consulting
the compass. Let us go and see what it says."</p>

<p id="id01876">The Professor moved towards the rock upon which Hans had laid down
the instruments. He was gay and full of spirits; he rubbed his hands,
he studied his attitudes. I followed him, curious to know if I was
right in my estimate. As soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle
took the compass, laid it horizontally, and questioned the needle,
which, after a few oscillations, presently assumed a fixed position.
My uncle looked, and looked, and looked again. He rubbed his eyes,
and then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery.</p>

<p id="id01877">"What is the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p id="id01878">He motioned to me to look. An exclamation of astonishment burst from
me. The north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be
the south. It pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea! I
shook the box, examined it again, it was in perfect condition. In
whatever position I placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned
to this unexpected quarter. Therefore there seemed no reason to doubt
that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind
unperceived by us, which had brought our raft back to the shore which
we thought we had left so long a distance behind us.</p>

<h2 id="id01879" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<h6 id="id01880">THE LIEDENBROCK MUSEUM OF GEOLOGY</h6>

<p id="id01881" style="margin-top: 2em">How shall I describe the strange series of passions which in
succession shook the breast of Professor Liedenbrock? First
stupefaction, then incredulity, lastly a downright burst of rage.
Never had I seen the man so put out of countenance and so disturbed.
The fatigues of our passage across, the dangers met, had all to be
begun over again. We had gone backwards instead of forwards!</p>

<p id="id01882">But my uncle rapidly recovered himself.</p>

<p id="id01883">"Aha! will fate play tricks upon me? Will the elements lay plots
against me? Shall fire, air, and water make a combined attack against
me? Well, they shall know what a determined man can do. I will not
yield. I will not stir a single foot backwards, and it will be seen
whether man or nature is to have the upper hand!"</p>

<p id="id01884">Erect upon the rock, angry and threatening, Otto Liedenbrock was a
rather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce Achilles defying the
lightning. But I thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay
some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism.</p>

<p id="id01885">"Just listen to me," I said firmly. "Ambition must have a limit
somewhere; we cannot perform impossibilities; we are not at all fit
for another sea voyage; who would dream of undertaking a voyage of
five hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks, with a blanket in
rags for a sail, a stick for a mast, and fierce winds in our teeth?
We cannot steer; we shall be buffeted by the tempests, and we should
be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time."</p>

<p id="id01886">I was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten
minutes without interruption; not that the Professor was paying any
respectful attention to his nephew's arguments, but because he was
deaf to all my eloquence.</p>

<p id="id01887">"To the raft!" he shouted.</p>

<p id="id01888">Such was his only reply. It was no use for me to entreat, supplicate,
get angry, or do anything else in the way of opposition; it would
only have been opposing a will harder than the granite rock.</p>

<p id="id01889">Hans was finishing the repairs of the raft. One would have thought
that this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions. With a
few more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel. A sail
already hung from the new mast, and the wind was playing in its
waving folds.</p>

<p id="id01890">The Professor said a few words to the guide, and immediately he put
everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure.
The air was clear&#8212;and the north-west wind blew steadily.</p>

<p id="id01891">What could I do? Could I stand against the two? It was impossible? If
Hans had but taken my side! But no, it was not to be. The Icelander
seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget
and deny himself. I could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised,
as it were, to his master. My only course was to proceed.</p>

<p id="id01892">I was therefore going with as much resignation as I could find to
resume my accustomed place on the raft, when my uncle laid his hand
upon my shoulder.</p>

<p id="id01893">"We shall not sail until to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p id="id01894">I made a movement intended to express resignation.</p>

<p id="id01895">"I must neglect nothing," he said; "and since my fate has driven me
on this part of the coast, I will not leave it until I have examined
it."</p>

<p id="id01896">To understand what followed, it must be borne in mind that, through
circumstances hereafter to be explained, we were not really where the
Professor supposed we were. In fact we were not upon the north shore
of the sea.</p>

<p id="id01897">"Now let us start upon fresh discoveries," I said.</p>

<p id="id01898">And leaving Hans to his work we started off together. The space
between the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable. It
took half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock. We trampled under
our feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed
in the earliest ages of the world. I also saw immense carapaces more
than fifteen feet in diameter. They had been the coverings of those
gigantic glyptodons or armadilloes of the pleiocene period, of which
the modern tortoise is but a miniature representative. [1] The soil
was besides this scattered with stony fragments, boulders rounded by
water action, and ridged up in successive lines. I was therefore led
to the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the
ground on which we were treading. On the loose and scattered rocks,
now out of the reach of the highest tides, the waves had left
manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone.</p>

<p id="id01899">This might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean
forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe. But in my opinion
this liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within
the interior of the earth, and it certainly had its origin in the
waters of the ocean overhead, which had made their way hither through
some fissure. Yet it must be believed that that fissure is now
closed, and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a
very short time. Perhaps even this water, subjected to the fierce
action of central heat, had partly been resolved into vapour. This
would explain the existence of those clouds suspended over our heads
and the development of that electricity which raised such tempests
within the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p id="id01900">This theory of the phenomena we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to
me; for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature, fixed
physical laws will or may always explain them.</p>

<p id="id01901">We were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil, the deposits of the
waters of former ages. The Professor was carefully examining every
little fissure in the rocks. Wherever he saw a hole he always wanted
to know the depth of it. To him this was important.</p>

<p id="id01902">We had traversed the shores of the Liedenbrock sea for a mile when we
observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil. It seemed
upset, contorted, and convulsed by a violent upheaval of the lower
strata. In many places depressions or elevations gave witness to some
tremendous power effecting the dislocation of strata.</p>

<p id="id01903">[1] The glyptodon and armadillo are mammalian; the tortoise is a
chelonian, a reptile, distinct classes of the animal kingdom;
therefore the latter cannot be a representative of the former.
(Trans.)</p>

<p id="id01904">We moved with difficulty across these granite fissures and chasms
mingled with silex, crystals of quartz, and alluvial deposits, when a
field, nay, more than a field, a vast plain, of bleached bones lay
spread before us. It seemed like an immense cemetery, where the
remains of twenty ages mingled their dust together. Huge mounds of
bony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance. They undulated
away to the limits of the horizon, and melted in the distance in a
faint haze. There within three square miles were accumulated the
materials for a complete history of the animal life of ages, a
history scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited
world.</p>

<p id="id01905">But an impatient curiosity impelled our steps; crackling and
rattling, our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric
animals and interesting fossils, the possession of which is a matter
of rivalry and contention between the museums of great cities. A
thousand Cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains
deposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection.</p>

<p id="id01906">I stood amazed. My uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault
which was our sky; his mouth gaping wide, his eyes flashing behind
his shining spectacles, his head balancing with an up-and-down
motion, his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment. Here he
stood facing an immense collection of scattered leptotheria,
mericotheria, lophiodia, anoplotheria, megatheria, mastodons,
protopithec&#230;, pterodactyles, and all sorts of extinct monsters here
assembled together for his special satisfaction. Fancy an
enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the
famous Alexandrian library burnt by Omar and restored by a miracle
from its ashes! just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle, Professor
Liedenbrock.</p>

<p id="id01907">But more was to come, when, with a rush through clouds of bone dust,
he laid his hand upon a bare skull, and cried with a voice trembling
with excitement:</p>

<p id="id01908">"Axel! Axel! a human head!"</p>

<p id="id01909">"A human skull?" I cried, no less astonished.</p>

<p id="id01910">"Yes, nephew. Aha! M. Milne-Edwards! Ah! M. de Quatrefages, how I
wish you were standing here at the side of Otto Liedenbrock!"</p>
