<p id="id00333">"Are you afraid of being put into a state of fusion?"</p>

<p id="id00334">"I will leave you to decide that question," I answered rather
sullenly. "This is my decision," replied Professor Liedenbrock,
putting on one of his grandest airs. "Neither you nor anybody else
knows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this
globe, since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known;
science is eminently perfectible; and every new theory is soon routed
by a newer. Was it not always believed until Fourier that the
temperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually? and
is it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the
ethereal regions is never lower than 40 degrees below zero Fahr.? Why
should it not be the same with the internal heat? Why should it not,
at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to
such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?"</p>

<p id="id00335">As my uncle was now taking his stand upon hypotheses, of course,
there was nothing to be said.</p>

<p id="id00336">"Well, I will tell you that true savants, amongst them Poisson, have
demonstrated that if a heat of 360,000 degrees<a id="noteref-4" href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-7.html#note-4">[4]</a> existed in the
interior of the globe, the fiery gases arising from the fused matter
would acquire an elastic force which the crust of the earth would be
unable to resist, and that it would explode like the plates of a
bursting boiler."</p>

<p id="id00337">"That is Poisson's opinion, my uncle, nothing more."</p>

<p id="id00338">"Granted. But it is likewise the creed adopted by other distinguished
geologists, that the interior of the globe is neither gas nor water,
nor any of the heaviest minerals known, for in none of these cases
would the earth weigh what it does."</p>

<p id="id00339">"Oh, with figures you may prove anything!"</p>

<p id="id00340">"But is it the same with facts! Is it not known that the number of
volcanoes has diminished since the first days of creation? and if
there is central heat may we not thence conclude that it is in
process of diminution?"</p>

<p id="id00341">"My good uncle, if you will enter into the legion of speculation, I
can discuss the matter no longer."</p>

<p id="id00342">"But I have to tell you that the highest names have come to the
support of my views. Do you remember a visit paid to me by the
celebrated chemist, Humphry Davy, in 1825?"</p>

<p id="id00343">"Not at all, for I was not born until nineteen years afterwards."</p>

<p id="id00344">"Well, Humphry Davy did call upon me on his way through Hamburg. We
were long engaged in discussing, amongst other problems, the
hypothesis of the liquid structure of the terrestrial nucleus. We
were agreed that it could not be in a liquid state, for a reason
which science has never been able to confute."</p>

<p id="id00346">"What is that reason?" I said, rather astonished.</p>

<p id="id00347">"Because this liquid mass would be subject, like the ocean, to the
lunar attraction, and therefore twice every day there would be
internal tides, which, upheaving the terrestrial crust, would cause
periodical earthquakes!"</p>

<p id="id00348">"Yet it is evident that the surface of the globe has been subject to
the action of fire," I replied, "and it is quite reasonable to
suppose that the external crust cooled down first, whilst the heat
took refuge down to the centre."</p>

<p id="id00349">"Quite a mistake," my uncle answered. "The earth has been heated by
combustion on its surface, that is all. Its surface was composed of a
great number of metals, such as potassium and sodium, which have the
peculiar property of igniting at the mere contact with air and water;
these metals kindled when the atmospheric vapours fell in rain upon
the soil; and by and by, when the waters penetrated into the fissures
of the crust of the earth, they broke out into fresh combustion with
explosions and eruptions. Such was the cause of the numerous
volcanoes at the origin of the earth."</p>

<p id="id00350">"Upon my word, this is a very clever hypothesis," I exclaimed, in
spite rather of myself.</p>

<p id="id00351">"And which Humphry Davy demonstrated to me by a simple experiment. He
formed a small ball of the metals which I have named, and which was a
very fair representation of our globe; whenever he caused a fine dew
of rain to fall upon its surface, it heaved up into little
monticules, it became oxydized and formed miniature mountains; a
crater broke open at one of its summits; the eruption took place, and
communicated to the whole of the ball such a heat that it could not
be held in the hand."</p>

<p id="id00352">In truth, I was beginning to be shaken by the Professor's arguments,
besides which he gave additional weight to them by his usual ardour
and fervent enthusiasm.</p>

<p id="id00353">"You see, Axel," he added, "the condition of the terrestrial nucleus
has given rise to various hypotheses among geologists; there is no
proof at all for this internal heat; my opinion is that there is no
such thing, it cannot be; besides we shall see for ourselves, and,
like Arne Saknussemm, we shall know exactly what to hold as truth
concerning this grand question."</p>

<p id="id00354">"Very well, we shall see," I replied, feeling myself carried off by
his contagious enthusiasm. "Yes, we shall see; that is, if it is
possible to see anything there."</p>

<p id="id00355">"And why not? May we not depend upon electric phenomena to give us
light? May we not even expect light from the atmosphere, the pressure
of which may render it luminous as we approach the centre?"</p>

<p id="id00356">"Yes, yes," said I; "that is possible, too."</p>

<p id="id00357">"It is certain," exclaimed my uncle in a tone of triumph. "But
silence, do you hear me? silence upon the whole subject; and let no
one get before us in this design of discovering the centre of the
earth."</p>

<h2 id="id00358" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h6 id="id00359">A WOMAN'S COURAGE</h6>

<p id="id00360" style="margin-top: 2em">Thus ended this memorable seance. That conversation threw me into a
fever. I came out of my uncle's study as if I had been stunned, and
as if there was not air enough in all the streets of Hamburg to put
me right again. I therefore made for the banks of the Elbe, where the
steamer lands her passengers, which forms the communication between
the city and the Hamburg railway.</p>

<p id="id00361">Was I convinced of the truth of what I had heard? Had I not bent
under the iron rule of the Professor Liedenbrock? Was I to believe
him in earnest in his intention to penetrate to the centre of this
massive globe? Had I been listening to the mad speculations of a
lunatic, or to the scientific conclusions of a lofty genius? Where
did truth stop? Where did error begin?</p>

<p id="id00362">I was all adrift amongst a thousand contradictory hypotheses, but I
could not lay hold of one.</p>

<p id="id00363">Yet I remembered that I had been convinced, although now my
enthusiasm was beginning to cool down; but I felt a desire to start
at once, and not to lose time and courage by calm reflection. I had
at that moment quite courage enough to strap my knapsack to my
shoulders and start.</p>

<p id="id00364">But I must confess that in another hour this unnatural excitement
abated, my nerves became unstrung, and from the depths of the abysses
of this earth I ascended to its surface again.</p>

<p id="id00365">"It is quite absurd!" I cried, "there is no sense about it. No
sensible young man should for a moment entertain such a proposal. The
whole thing is non-existent. I have had a bad night, I have been
dreaming of horrors."</p>

<p id="id00366">But I had followed the banks of the Elbe and passed the town. After
passing the port too, I had reached the Altona road. I was led by a
presentiment, soon to be realised; for shortly I espied my little
Gr&#228;uben bravely returning with her light step to Hamburg.</p>

<p id="id00367">"Gr&#228;uben!" I cried from afar off.</p>

<p id="id00368">The young girl stopped, rather frightened perhaps to hear her name
called after her on the high road. Ten yards more, and I had joined
her.</p>

<p id="id00369">"Axel!" she cried surprised. "What! have you come to meet me? Is this
why you are here, sir?"</p>

<p id="id00370">But when she had looked upon me, Gr&#228;uben could not fail to see the
uneasiness and distress of my mind.</p>

<p id="id00371">"What is the matter?" she said, holding out her hand.</p>

<p id="id00372">"What is the matter, Gr&#228;uben?" I cried.</p>

<p id="id00373">In a couple of minutes my pretty Virlandaise was fully informed of
the position of affairs. For a time she was silent. Did her heart
palpitate as mine did? I don't know about that, but I know that her
hand did not tremble in mine. We went on a hundred yards without
speaking.</p>

<p id="id00374">At last she said, "Axel!"</p>

<p id="id00375">"My dear Gr&#228;uben."</p>

<p id="id00376">"That will be a splendid journey!"</p>

<p id="id00377">I gave a bound at these words.</p>

<p id="id00378">"Yes, Axel, a journey worthy of the nephew of a savant; it is a good
thing for a man to be distinguished by some great enterprise."</p>

<p id="id00379">"What, Gr&#228;uben, won't you dissuade me from such an undertaking?"</p>

<p id="id00380">"No, my dear Axel, and I would willingly go with you, but that a poor
girl would only be in your way."</p>

<p id="id00381">"Is that quite true?"</p>

<p id="id00382">"It is true."</p>

<p id="id00383">Ah! women and young girls, how incomprehensible are your feminine
hearts! When you are not the timidest, you are the bravest of
creatures. Reason has nothing to do with your actions. What! did this
child encourage me in such an expedition! Would she not be afraid to
join it herself? And she was driving me to it, one whom she loved!</p>

<p id="id00384">I was disconcerted, and, if I must tell the whole truth, I was
ashamed.</p>

<p id="id00385">"Gr&#228;uben, we will see whether you will say the same thing to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id00386">"To-morrow, dear Axel, I will say what I say to-day."</p>

<p id="id00387">Gr&#228;uben and I, hand in hand, but in silence, pursued our way. The
emotions of that day were breaking my heart.</p>

<p id="id00388">After all, I thought, the kalends of July are a long way off, and
between this and then many things may take place which will cure my
uncle of his desire to travel underground.</p>

<p id="id00389">It was night when we arrived at the house in K&#246;nigstrasse. I expected
to find all quiet there, my uncle in bed as was his custom, and
Martha giving her last touches with the feather brush.</p>

<p id="id00390">But I had not taken into account the Professor's impatience. I found
him shouting&#8212;and working himself up amidst a crowd of porters and
messengers who were all depositing various loads in the passage. Our
old servant was at her wits' end.</p>

<p id="id00391">"Come, Axel, come, you miserable wretch," my uncle cried from as far
off as he could see me. "Your boxes are not packed, and my papers are
not arranged; where's the key of my carpet bag? and what have you
done with my gaiters?"</p>

<p id="id00392">I stood thunderstruck. My voice failed. Scarcely could my lips utter
the words:</p>

<p id="id00393">"Are we really going?"</p>

<p id="id00394">"Of course, you unhappy boy! Could I have dreamed that you would have
gone out for a walk instead of hurrying your preparations forward?"</p>

<p id="id00395">"Are we to go?" I asked again, with sinking hopes.</p>

<p id="id00396">"Yes; the day after to-morrow, early."</p>

<p id="id00397">I could hear no more. I fled for refuge into my own little room.</p>

<p id="id00398">All hope was now at an end. My uncle had been all the morning making
purchases of a part of the tools and apparatus required for this
desperate undertaking. The passage was encumbered with rope ladders,
knotted cords, torches, flasks, grappling irons, alpenstocks,
pickaxes, iron shod sticks, enough to load ten men.</p>

<p id="id00399">I spent an awful night. Next morning I was called early. I had quite
decided I would not open the door. But how was I to resist the sweet
voice which was always music to my ears, saying, "My dear Axel?"</p>

<p id="id00400">I came out of my room. I thought my pale countenance and my red and
sleepless eyes would work upon Gr&#228;uben's sympathies and change her
mind.</p>

<p id="id00401">"Ah! my dear Axel," she said. "I see you are better. A night's rest
has done you good."</p>

<p id="id00402">"Done me good!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id00403">I rushed to the glass. Well, in fact I did look better than I had
expected. I could hardly believe my own eyes.</p>

<p id="id00404">"Axel," she said, "I have had a long talk with my guardian. He is a
bold philosopher, a man of immense courage, and you must remember
that his blood flows in your veins. He has confided to me his plans,
his hopes, and why and how he hopes to attain his object. He will no
doubt succeed. My dear Axel, it is a grand thing to devote yourself
to science! What honour will fall upon Herr Liedenbrock, and so be
reflected upon his companion! When you return, Axel, you will be a
man, his equal, free to speak and to act independently, and free to
&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00405">The dear girl only finished this sentence by blushing. Her words
revived me. Yet I refused to believe we should start. I drew Gr&#228;uben
into the Professor's study.</p>

<p id="id00406">"Uncle, is it true that we are to go?"</p>

<p id="id00407">"Why do you doubt?"</p>

<p id="id00408">"Well, I don't doubt," I said, not to vex him; "but, I ask, what need
is there to hurry?"</p>

<p id="id00409">"Time, time, flying with irreparable rapidity."</p>

<p id="id00410">"But it is only the 16th May, and until the end of June&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00411">"What, you monument of ignorance! do you think you can get to Iceland
in a couple of days? If you had not deserted me like a fool I should
have taken you to the Copenhagen office, to Liffender &amp; Co., and you
would have learned then that there is only one trip every month from
Copenhagen to Rejkiavik, on the 22nd."</p>

<p id="id00412">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id00413">"Well, if we waited for the 22nd June we should be too late to see
the shadow of Scartaris touch the crater of Sneffels. Therefore we
must get to Copenhagen as fast as we can to secure our passage. Go
and pack up."</p>

<p id="id00414">There was no reply to this. I went up to my room. Gr&#228;uben followed
me. She undertook to pack up all things necessary for my voyage. She
was no more moved than if I had been starting for a little trip to
L&#252;beck or Heligoland. Her little hands moved without haste. She
talked quietly. She supplied me with sensible reasons for our
expedition. She delighted me, and yet I was angry with her. Now and
then I felt I ought to break out into a passion, but she took no
notice and went on her way as methodically as ever.</p>

<p id="id00415">Finally the last strap was buckled; I came downstairs. All that day
the philosophical instrument makers and the electricians kept coming
and going. Martha was distracted.</p>

<p id="id00416">"Is master mad?" she asked.</p>

<p id="id00417">I nodded my head.</p>

<p id="id00418">"And is he going to take you with him?"</p>

<p id="id00419">I nodded again.</p>

<p id="id00420">"Where to?"</p>

<p id="id00421">I pointed with my finger downward.</p>

<p id="id00422">"Down into the cellar?" cried the old servant.</p>

<p id="id00423">"No," I said. "Lower down than that."</p>

<p id="id00424">Night came. But I knew nothing about the lapse of time.</p>

<p id="id00425">"To-morrow morning at six precisely," my uncle decreed "we start."</p>

<p id="id00426">At ten o'clock I fell upon my bed, a dead lump of inert matter. All
through the night terror had hold of me. I spent it dreaming of
abysses. I was a prey to delirium. I felt myself grasped by the
Professor's sinewy hand, dragged along, hurled down, shattered into
little bits. I dropped down unfathomable precipices with the
accelerating velocity of bodies falling through space. My life had
become an endless fall. I awoke at five with shattered nerves,
trembling and weary. I came downstairs. My uncle was at table,
devouring his breakfast. I stared at him with horror and disgust. But
dear Gr&#228;uben was there; so I said nothing, and could eat nothing.</p>

<p id="id00427">At half-past five there was a rattle of wheels outside. A large
carriage was there to take us to the Altona railway station. It was
soon piled up with my uncle's multifarious preparations.</p>

<p id="id00428">"Where's your box?" he cried.</p>

<p id="id00429">"It is ready," I replied, with faltering voice.</p>

<p id="id00430">"Then make haste down, or we shall lose the train."</p>

<p id="id00431">It was now manifestly impossible to maintain the struggle against
destiny. I went up again to my room, and rolling my portmanteaus
downstairs I darted after him.</p>

<p id="id00432">At that moment my uncle was solemnly investing Gr&#228;uben with the reins
of government. My pretty Virlandaise was as calm and collected as was
her wont. She kissed her guardian; but could not restrain a tear in
touching my cheek with her gentle lips.</p>

<p id="id00433">"Gr&#228;uben!" I murmured.</p>

<p id="id00434">"Go, my dear Axel, go! I am now your betrothed; and when you come
back I will be your wife."</p>

<p id="id00435">I pressed her in my arms and took my place in the carriage. Martha
and the young girl, standing at the door, waved their last farewell.
Then the horses, roused by the driver's whistling, darted off at a
gallop on the road to Altona.</p>

<h2 id="id00436" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h6 id="id00437">SERIOUS PREPARATIONS FOR VERTICAL DESCENT</h6>

<p id="id00438" style="margin-top: 2em">Altona, which is but a suburb of Hamburg, is the terminus of the Kiel
railway, which was to carry us to the Belts. In twenty minutes we
were in Holstein.</p>

<p id="id00439">At half-past six the carriage stopped at the station; my uncle's
numerous packages, his voluminous <i>impedimenta,</i> were unloaded,
removed, labelled, weighed, put into the luggage vans, and at seven
we were seated face to face in our compartment. The whistle sounded,
the engine started, we were off.</p>

<p id="id00440">Was I resigned? No, not yet. Yet the cool morning air and the scenes
on the road, rapidly changed by the swiftness of the train, drew me
away somewhat from my sad reflections.</p>

<p id="id00441">As for the Professor's reflections, they went far in advance of the
swiftest express. We were alone in the carriage, but we sat in
silence. My uncle examined all his pockets and his travelling bag
with the minutest care. I saw that he had not forgotten the smallest
matter of detail.</p>

<p id="id00442">Amongst other documents, a sheet of paper, carefully folded, bore the
heading of the Danish consulate with the signature of W.
Christiensen, consul at Hamburg and the Professor's friend. With this
we possessed the proper introductions to the Governor of Iceland.</p>

<p id="id00443">I also observed the famous document most carefully laid up in a
secret pocket in his portfolio. I bestowed a malediction upon it, and
then proceeded to examine the country.</p>

<p id="id00444">It was a very long succession of uninteresting loamy and fertile
flats, a very easy country for the construction of railways, and
propitious for the laying-down of these direct level lines so dear to
railway companies.</p>

<p id="id00445">I had no time to get tired of the monotony; for in three hours we
stopped at Kiel, close to the sea.</p>

<p id="id00446">The luggage being labelled for Copenhagen, we had no occasion to look
after it. Yet the Professor watched every article with jealous
vigilance, until all were safe on board. There they disappeared in
the hold.</p>

<p id="id00447">My uncle, notwithstanding his hurry, had so well calculated the
relations between the train and the steamer that we had a whole day
to spare. The steamer <i>Ellenora,</i> did not start until night. Thence
sprang a feverish state of excitement in which the impatient
irascible traveller devoted to perdition the railway directors and
the steamboat companies and the governments which allowed such
intolerable slowness. I was obliged to act chorus to him when he
attacked the captain of the <i>Ellenora</i> upon this subject. The captain
disposed of us summarily.</p>

<p id="id00448">At Kiel, as elsewhere, we must do something to while away the time.
What with walking on the verdant shores of the bay within which
nestles the little town, exploring the thick woods which make it look
like a nest embowered amongst thick foliage, admiring the villas,
each provided with a little bathing house, and moving about and
grumbling, at last ten o'clock came.</p>

<p id="id00449">The heavy coils of smoke from the <i>Ellenora's</i> funnel unrolled in the
sky, the bridge shook with the quivering of the struggling steam; we
were on board, and owners for the time of two berths, one over the
other, in the only saloon cabin on board.</p>

<p id="id00450">At a quarter past the moorings were loosed and the throbbing steamer
pursued her way over the dark waters of the Great Belt.</p>

<p id="id00451">The night was dark; there was a sharp breeze and a rough sea, a few
lights appeared on shore through the thick darkness; later on, I
cannot tell when, a dazzling light from some lighthouse threw a
bright stream of fire along the waves; and this is all I can remember
of this first portion of our sail.</p>

<p id="id00452">At seven in the morning we landed at Korsor, a small town on the west
coast of Zealand. There we were transferred from the boat to another
line of railway, which took us by just as flat a country as the plain
of Holstein.</p>

<p id="id00453">Three hours' travelling brought us to the capital of Denmark. My
uncle had not shut his eyes all night. In his impatience I believe he
was trying to accelerate the train with his feet.</p>

<p id="id00454">At last he discerned a stretch of sea.</p>

<p id="id00455">"The Sound!" he cried.</p>

<p id="id00456">At our left was a huge building that looked like a hospital.</p>

<p id="id00457">"That's a lunatic asylum," said one of or travelling companions.</p>

<p id="id00458">Very good! thought I, just the place we want to end our days in; and
great as it is, that asylum is not big enough to contain all
Professor Liedenbrock's madness!</p>

<p id="id00459">At ten in the morning, at last, we set our feet in Copenhagen; the
luggage was put upon a carriage and taken with ourselves to the
Phoenix Hotel in Breda Gate. This took half an hour, for the station
is out of the town. Then my uncle, after a hasty toilet, dragged me
after him. The porter at the hotel could speak German and English;
but the Professor, as a polyglot, questioned him in good Danish, and
it was in the same language that that personage directed him to the
Museum of Northern Antiquities.</p>

<p id="id00460">The curator of this curious establishment, in which wonders are
gathered together out of which the ancient history of the country
might be reconstructed by means of its stone weapons, its cups and
its jewels, was a learned savant, the friend of the Danish consul at
Hamburg, Professor Thomsen.</p>

<p id="id00461">My uncle had a cordial letter of introduction to him. As a general
rule one savant greets another with coolness. But here the case was
different. M. Thomsen, like a good friend, gave the Professor
Liedenbrock a cordial greeting, and he even vouchsafed the same
kindness to his nephew. It is hardly necessary to say the secret was
sacredly kept from the excellent curator; we were simply
disinterested travellers visiting Iceland out of harmless curiosity.</p>

<p id="id00462">M. Thomsen placed his services at our disposal, and we visited the
quays with the object of finding out the next vessel to sail.</p>

<p id="id00463">I was yet in hopes that there would be no means of getting to
Iceland. But there was no such luck. A small Danish schooner, the
<i>Valkyria</i>, was to set sail for Rejkiavik on the 2nd of June. The
captain, M. Bjarne, was on board. His intending passenger was so
joyful that he almost squeezed his hands till they ached. That good
man was rather surprised at his energy. To him it seemed a very
simple thing to go to Iceland, as that was his business; but to my
uncle it was sublime. The worthy captain took advantage of his
enthusiasm to charge double fares; but we did not trouble ourselves
about mere trifles. .</p>

<p id="id00464">"You must be on board on Tuesday, at seven in the morning," said<br/>

Captain Bjarne, after having pocketed more dollars than were his due.<br/></p>

<p id="id00465">Then we thanked M. Thomsen for his kindness, "and we returned to the<br/>

Phoenix Hotel.<br/></p>

<p id="id00466">"It's all right, it's all right," my uncle repeated. "How fortunate
we are to have found this boat ready for sailing. Now let us have
some breakfast and go about the town."</p>

<p id="id00467">We went first to Kongens-nye-Torw, an irregular square in which are
two innocent-looking guns, which need not alarm any one. Close by, at
No. 5, there was a French "restaurant," kept by a cook of the name of
Vincent, where we had an ample breakfast for four marks each (2_s_.
4_d_.).</p>

<p id="id00468">Then I took a childish pleasure in exploring the city; my uncle let
me take him with me, but he took notice of nothing, neither the
insignificant king's palace, nor the pretty seventeenth century
bridge, which spans the canal before the museum, nor that immense
cenotaph of Thorwaldsen's, adorned with horrible mural painting, and
containing within it a collection of the sculptor's works, nor in a
fine park the toylike chateau of Rosenberg, nor the beautiful
renaissance edifice of the Exchange, nor its spire composed of the
twisted tails of four bronze dragons, nor the great windmill on the
ramparts, whose huge arms dilated in the sea breeze like the sails of
a ship.</p>

<p id="id00469">What delicious walks we should have had together, my pretty
Virlandaise and I, along the harbour where the two-deckers and the
frigate slept peaceably by the red roofing of the warehouse, by the
green banks of the strait, through the deep shades of the trees
amongst which the fort is half concealed, where the guns are
thrusting out their black throats between branches of alder and
willow.</p>

<p id="id00470">But, alas! Gr&#228;uben was far away; and I never hoped to see her again.</p>

<p id="id00471">But if my uncle felt no attraction towards these romantic scenes he
was very much struck with the aspect of a certain church spire
situated in the island of Amak, which forms the south-west quarter of
Copenhagen.</p>

<p id="id00472">I was ordered to direct my feet that way; I embarked on a small
steamer which plies on the canals, and in a few minutes she touched
the quay of the dockyard.</p>

<p id="id00473">After crossing a few narrow streets where some convicts, in trousers
half yellow and half grey, were at work under the orders of the
gangers, we arrived at the Vor Frelsers Kirk. There was nothing
remarkable about the church; but there was a reason why its tall
spire had attracted the Professor's attention. Starting from the top
of the tower, an external staircase wound around the spire, the
spirals circling up into the sky.</p>

<p id="id00474">"Let us get to the top," said my uncle.</p>

<p id="id00475">"I shall be dizzy," I said.</p>

<p id="id00476">"The more reason why we should go up; we must get used to it."</p>

<p id="id00477">"But&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00478">"Come, I tell you; don't waste our time."</p>

<p id="id00479">I had to obey. A keeper who lived at the other end of the street
handed us the key, and the ascent began.</p>

<p id="id00480">My uncle went ahead with a light step. I followed him not without
alarm, for my head was very apt to feel dizzy; I possessed neither
the equilibrium of an eagle nor his fearless nature.</p>

<p id="id00481">As long as we were protected on the inside of the winding staircase
up the tower, all was well enough; but after toiling up a hundred and
fifty steps the fresh air came to salute my face, and we were on the
leads of the tower. There the aerial staircase began its gyrations,
only guarded by a thin iron rail, and the narrowing steps seemed to
ascend into infinite space!</p>

<p id="id00482">"Never shall I be able to do it," I said.</p>

<p id="id00483">"Don't be a coward; come up, sir"; said my uncle with the coldest
cruelty.</p>

<p id="id00484">I had to follow, clutching at every step. The keen air made me giddy;
I felt the spire rocking with every gust of wind; my knees began to
fail; soon I was crawling on my knees, then creeping on my stomach; I
closed my eyes; I seemed to be lost in space.</p>

<p id="id00485">At last I reached the apex, with the assistance of my uncle dragging
me up by the collar.</p>

<p id="id00486">"Look down!" he cried. "Look down well! You must take a lesson
in abysses."</p>

<p id="id00487">I opened my eyes. I saw houses squashed flat as if they had all
fallen down from the skies; a smoke fog seemed to drown them. Over my
head ragged clouds were drifting past, and by an optical inversion
they seemed stationary, while the steeple, the ball and I were all
spinning along with fantastic speed. Far away on one side was the
green country, on the other the sea sparkled, bathed in sunlight. The
Sound stretched away to Elsinore, dotted with a few white sails, like
sea-gulls' wings; and in the misty east and away to the north-east
lay outstretched the faintly-shadowed shores of Sweden. All this
immensity of space whirled and wavered, fluctuating beneath my eyes.</p>

<p id="id00488">But I was compelled to rise, to stand up, to look. My first lesson in
dizziness lasted an hour. When I got permission to come down and feel
the solid street pavements I was afflicted with severe lumbago.</p>

<p id="id00489">"To-morrow we will do it again," said the Professor.</p>

<p id="id00490">And it was so; for five days in succession, I was obliged to undergo
this anti-vertiginous exercise; and whether I would or not, I made
some improvement in the art of "lofty contemplations."</p>

<h2 id="id00491" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h6 id="id00492">ICELAND! BUT WHAT NEXT?</h6>

<p id="id00493" style="margin-top: 2em">The day for our departure arrived. The day before it our kind friend<br/>

M. Thomsen brought us letters of introduction to Count Trampe, the<br/>

Governor of Iceland, M. Picturssen, the bishop's suffragan, and M.<br/>

Finsen, mayor of Rejkiavik. My uncle expressed his gratitude by<br/>

tremendous compressions of both his hands.<br/></p>

<p id="id00494">On the 2nd, at six in the evening, all our precious baggage being
safely on board the <i>Valkyria,</i> the captain took us into a very
narrow cabin.</p>

<p id="id00495">"Is the wind favourable?" my uncle asked.</p>

<p id="id00496">"Excellent," replied Captain Bjarne; "a sou'-easter. We shall pass
down the Sound full speed, with all sails set."</p>

<p id="id00497">In a few minutes the schooner, under her mizen, brigantine, topsail,
and topgallant sail, loosed from her moorings and made full sail
through the straits. In an hour the capital of Denmark seemed to sink
below the distant waves, and the <i>Valkyria</i> was skirting the coast by
Elsinore. In my nervous frame of mind I expected to see the ghost of
Hamlet wandering on the legendary castle terrace.</p>

<p id="id00498">"Sublime madman!" I said, "no doubt you would approve of our
expedition. Perhaps you would keep us company to the centre of the
globe, to find the solution of your eternal doubts."</p>

<p id="id00499">But there was no ghostly shape upon the ancient walls. Indeed, the
castle is much younger than the heroic prince of Denmark. It now
answers the purpose of a sumptuous lodge for the doorkeeper of the
straits of the Sound, before which every year there pass fifteen
thousand ships of all nations.</p>

<p id="id00500">The castle of Kronsberg soon disappeared in the mist, as well as the
tower of Helsingborg, built on the Swedish coast, and the schooner
passed lightly on her way urged by the breezes of the Cattegat.</p>

<p id="id00501">The <i>Valkyria</i> was a splendid sailer, but on a sailing vessel you can
place no dependence. She was taking to Rejkiavik coal, household
goods, earthenware, woollen clothing, and a cargo of wheat. The crew
consisted of five men, all Danes.</p>

<p id="id00502">"How long will the passage take?" my uncle asked.</p>

<p id="id00503">"Ten days," the captain replied, "if we don't meet a nor'-wester in
passing the Faroes."</p>

<p id="id00504">"But are you not subject to considerable delays?"</p>

<p id="id00505">"No, M. Liedenbrock, don't be uneasy, we shall get there in very good
time."</p>

<p id="id00506">At evening the schooner doubled the Skaw at the northern point of<br/>

Denmark, in the night passed the Skager Rack, skirted Norway by Cape<br/>

Lindness, and entered the North Sea.<br/></p>

<p id="id00507">In two days more we sighted the coast of Scotland near Peterhead, and
the <i>Valkyria</i> turned her lead towards the Faroe Islands, passing
between the Orkneys and Shetlands.</p>

<p id="id00508">Soon the schooner encountered the great Atlantic swell; she had to
tack against the north wind, and reached the Faroes only with some
difficulty. On the 8th the captain made out Myganness, the
southernmost of these islands, and from that moment took a straight
course for Cape Portland, the most southerly point of Iceland.</p>

<p id="id00509">The passage was marked by nothing unusual. I bore the troubles of the
sea pretty well; my uncle, to his own intense disgust, and his
greater shame, was ill all through the voyage.</p>

<p id="id00510">He therefore was unable to converse with the captain about Sn&#230;fell,
the way to get to it, the facilities for transport, he was obliged to
put off these inquiries until his arrival, and spent all his time at
full length in his cabin, of which the timbers creaked and shook with
every pitch she took. It must be confessed he was not undeserving of
his punishment.</p>

<p id="id00511">On the 11th we reached Cape Portland. The clear open weather gave us
a good view of Myrdals jokul, which overhangs it. The cape is merely
a low hill with steep sides, standing lonely by the beach.</p>

<p id="id00512">The <i>Valkyria</i> kept at some distance from the coast, taking a
westerly course amidst great shoals of whales and sharks. Soon we
came in sight of an enormous perforated rock, through which the sea
dashed furiously. The Westman islets seemed to rise out of the ocean
like a group of rocks in a liquid plain. From that time the schooner
took a wide berth and swept at a great distance round Cape
Rejkianess, which forms the western point of Iceland.</p>

<p id="id00513">The rough sea prevented my uncle from coming on deck to admire these
shattered and surf-beaten coasts.</p>

<p id="id00514">Forty-eight hours after, coming out of a storm which forced the
schooner to scud under bare poles, we sighted east of us the beacon
on Cape Skagen, where dangerous rocks extend far away seaward. An
Icelandic pilot came on board, and in three hours the <i>Valkyria</i>
dropped her anchor before Rejkiavik, in Faxa Bay.</p>

<p id="id00515">The Professor at last emerged from his cabin, rather pale and
wretched-looking, but still full of enthusiasm, and with ardent
satisfaction shining in his eyes.</p>

<p id="id00516">The population of the town, wonderfully interested in the arrival of
a vessel from which every one expected something, formed in groups
upon the quay.</p>

<p id="id00517">My uncle left in haste his floating prison, or rather hospital. But
before quitting the deck of the schooner he dragged me forward, and
pointing with outstretched finger north of the bay at a distant
mountain terminating in a double peak, a pair of cones covered with
perpetual snow, he cried:</p>

<p id="id00518">"Sn&#230;fell! Sn&#230;fell!"</p>

<p id="id00519">Then recommending me, by an impressive gesture, to keep silence, he
went into the boat which awaited him. I followed, and presently we
were treading the soil of Iceland.</p>

<p id="id00520">The first man we saw was a good-looking fellow enough, in a general's
uniform. Yet he was not a general but a magistrate, the Governor of
the island, M. le Baron Trampe himself. The Professor was soon aware
of the presence he was in. He delivered him his letters from
Copenhagen, and then followed a short conversation in the Danish
language, the purport of which I was quite ignorant of, and for a
very good reason. But the result of this first conversation was, that
Baron Trampe placed himself entirely at the service of Professor
Liedenbrock.</p>

<p id="id00521">My uncle was just as courteously received by the mayor, M. Finsen,
whose appearance was as military, and disposition and office as
pacific, as the Governor's.</p>

<p id="id00522">As for the bishop's suffragan, M. Picturssen, he was at that moment
engaged on an episcopal visitation in the north. For the time we must
be resigned to wait for the honour of being presented to him. But M.
Fridrikssen, professor of natural sciences at the school of
Rejkiavik, was a delightful man, and his friendship became very
precious to me. This modest philosopher spoke only Danish and Latin.
He came to proffer me his good offices in the language of Horace, and
I felt that we were made to understand each other. In fact he was the
only person in Iceland with whom I could converse at all.</p>

<p id="id00523">This good-natured gentleman made over to us two of the three rooms
which his house contained, and we were soon installed in it with all
our luggage, the abundance of which rather astonished the good people
of Rejkiavik.</p>

<p id="id00524">"Well, Axel," said my uncle, "we are getting on, and now the worst is
over."</p>

<p id="id00525">"The worst!" I said, astonished.</p>

<p id="id00526">"To be sure, now we have nothing to do but go down."</p>

<p id="id00527">"Oh, if that is all, you are quite right; but after all, when we have
gone down, we shall have to get up again, I suppose?"</p>

<p id="id00528">"Oh I don't trouble myself about that. Come, there's no time to lose;<br/>

I am going to the library. Perhaps there is some manuscript of<br/>

Saknussemm's there, and I should be glad to consult it."<br/></p>

<p id="id00529">"Well, while you are there I will go into the town. Won't you?"</p>

<p id="id00530">"Oh, that is very uninteresting to me. It is not what is upon this
island, but what is underneath, that interests me."</p>

<p id="id00531">I went out, and wandered wherever chance took me.</p>

<p id="id00532">It would not be easy to lose your way in Rejkiavik. I was therefore
under no necessity to inquire the road, which exposes one to mistakes
when the only medium of intercourse is gesture.</p>

<p id="id00533">The town extends along a low and marshy level, between two hills. An
immense bed of lava bounds it on one side, and falls gently towards
the sea. On the other extends the vast bay of Faxa, shut in at the
north by the enormous glacier of the Sn&#230;fell, and of which the
<i>Valkyria</i> was for the time the only occupant. Usually the English
and French conservators of fisheries moor in this bay, but just then
they were cruising about the western coasts of the island.</p>

<p id="id00534">The longest of the only two streets that Rejkiavik possesses was
parallel with the beach. Here live the merchants and traders, in
wooden cabins made of red planks set horizontally; the other street,
running west, ends at the little lake between the house of the bishop
and other non-commercial people.</p>

<p id="id00535">I had soon explored these melancholy ways; here and there I got a
glimpse of faded turf, looking like a worn-out bit of carpet, or some
appearance of a kitchen garden, the sparse vegetables of which
(potatoes, cabbages, and lettuces), would have figured appropriately
upon a Lilliputian table. A few sickly wallflowers were trying to
enjoy the air and sunshine.</p>

<p id="id00536">About the middle of the tin-commercial street I found the public
cemetery, inclosed with a mud wall, and where there seemed plenty of
room.</p>

<p id="id00537">Then a few steps brought me to the Governor's house, a but compared
with the town hall of Hamburg, a palace in comparison with the cabins
of the Icelandic population.</p>

<p id="id00538">Between the little lake and the town the church is built in the
Protestant style, of calcined stones extracted out of the volcanoes
by their own labour and at their own expense; in high westerly winds
it was manifest that the red tiles of the roof would be scattered in
the air, to the great danger of the faithful worshippers.</p>

<p id="id00539">On a neighbouring hill I perceived the national school, where, as I
was informed later by our host, were taught Hebrew, English, French,
and Danish, four languages of which, with shame I confess it, I don't
know a single word; after an examination I should have had to stand
last of the forty scholars educated at this little college, and I
should have been held unworthy to sleep along with them in one of
those little double closets, where more delicate youths would have
died of suffocation the very first night.</p>

<p id="id00540">In three hours I had seen not only the town but its environs. The
general aspect was wonderfully dull. No trees, and scarcely any
vegetation. Everywhere bare rocks, signs of volcanic action. The
Icelandic huts are made of earth and turf, and the walls slope
inward; they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground. But then
these roofs are meadows of comparative fertility. Thanks to the
internal heat, the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection.
It is carefully mown in the hay season; if it were not, the horses
would come to pasture on these green abodes.</p>

<p id="id00541">In my excursion I met but few people. On returning to the main street
I found the greater part of the population busied in drying, salting,
and putting on board codfish, their chief export. The men looked like
robust but heavy, blond Germans with pensive eyes, conscious of being
far removed from their fellow creatures, poor exiles relegated to
this land of ice, poor creatures who should have been Esquimaux,
since nature had condemned them to live only just outside the arctic
circle! In vain did I try to detect a smile upon their lips;
sometimes by a spasmodic and involuntary contraction of the muscles
they seemed to laugh, but they never smiled.</p>

<p id="id00542">Their costume consisted of a coarse jacket of black woollen cloth
called in Scandinavian lands a 'vadmel,' a hat with a very broad
brim, trousers with a narrow edge of red, and a bit of leather rolled
round the foot for shoes.</p>

<p id="id00543">The women looked as sad and as resigned as the men; their faces were
agreeable but expressionless, and they wore gowns and petticoats of
dark 'vadmel'; as maidens, they wore over their braided hair a little
knitted brown cap; when married, they put around their heads a
coloured handkerchief, crowned with a peak of white linen.</p>

<p id="id00544">After a good walk I returned to M. Fridrikssen's house, where I found
my uncle already in his host's company.</p>

<h2 id="id00545" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h6 id="id00546">INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH ICELANDIC SAVANTS</h6>

<p id="id00547" style="margin-top: 2em">Dinner was ready. Professor Liedenbrock devoured his portion
voraciously, for his compulsory fast on board had converted his
stomach into a vast unfathomable gulf. There was nothing remarkable
in the meal itself; but the hospitality of our host, more Danish than
Icelandic, reminded me of the heroes of old. It was evident that we
were more at home than he was himself.</p>

<p id="id00548">The conversation was carried on in the vernacular tongue, which my
uncle mixed with German and M. Fridrikssen with Latin for my benefit.
It turned upon scientific questions as befits philosophers; but
Professor Liedenbrock was excessively reserved, and at every sentence
spoke to me with his eyes, enjoining the most absolute silence upon
our plans.</p>

<p id="id00549">In the first place M. Fridrikssen wanted to know what success my
uncle had had at the library.</p>

<p id="id00550">"Your library! why there is nothing but a few tattered books upon
almost deserted shelves."</p>

<p id="id00551">"Indeed!" replied M. Fridrikssen, "why we possess eight thousand
volumes, many of them valuable and scarce, works in the old
Scandinavian language, and we have all the novelties that Copenhagen
sends us every year."</p>

<p id="id00552">"Where do you keep your eight thousand volumes? For my part&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00553">"Oh, M. Liedenbrock, they are all over the country. In this icy
region we are fond of study. There is not a farmer nor a fisherman
that cannot read and does not read. Our principle is, that books,
instead of growing mouldy behind an iron grating, should be worn out
under the eyes of many readers. Therefore, these volumes are passed
from one to another, read over and over, referred to again and again;
and it often happens that they find their way back to their shelves
only after an absence of a year or two."</p>

<p id="id00554">"And in the meantime," said my uncle rather spitefully, "strangers&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00555">"Well, what would you have? Foreigners have their libraries at home,
and the first essential for labouring people is that they should be
educated. I repeat to you the love of reading runs in Icelandic
blood. In 1816 we founded a prosperous literary society; learned
strangers think themselves honoured in becoming members of it. It
publishes books which educate our fellow-countrymen, and do the
country great service. If you will consent to be a corresponding
member, Herr Liedenbrock, you will be giving us great pleasure."</p>

<p id="id00556">My uncle, who had already joined about a hundred learned societies,
accepted with a grace which evidently touched M. Fridrikssen.</p>

<p id="id00557">"Now," said he, "will you be kind enough to tell me what books you
hoped to find in our library and I may perhaps enable you to consult
them?"</p>

<p id="id00558">My uncle's eyes and mine met. He hesitated. This direct question went
to the root of the matter. But after a moment's reflection he decided
on speaking.</p>

<p id="id00559">"Monsieur Fridrikssen, I wished to know if amongst your ancient books
you possessed any of the works of Arne Saknussemm?"</p>

<p id="id00560">"Arne Saknussemm!" replied the Rejkiavik professor. "You mean that
learned sixteenth century savant, a naturalist, a chemist, and a
traveller?"</p>

<p id="id00561">"Just so!"</p>

<p id="id00562">"One of the glories of Icelandic literature and science?"</p>

<p id="id00563">"That's the man."</p>

<p id="id00564">"An illustrious man anywhere!"</p>

<p id="id00565">"Quite so."</p>

<p id="id00566">"And whose courage was equal to his genius!"</p>

<p id="id00567">"I see that you know him well."</p>

<p id="id00568">My uncle was bathed in delight at hearing his hero thus described. He
feasted his eyes upon M. Fridrikssen's face.</p>

<p id="id00569">"Well," he cried, "where are his works?"</p>

<p id="id00570">"His works, we have them not."</p>

<p id="id00571">"What&#8212;not in Iceland?"</p>

<p id="id00572">"They are neither in Iceland nor anywhere else."</p>

<p id="id00573">"Why is that?"</p>

<p id="id00574">"Because Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy, and in 1573 his
books were burned by the hands of the common hangman."</p>

<p id="id00575">"Very good! Excellent!" cried my uncle, to the great scandal of the
professor of natural history.</p>

<p id="id00576">"What!" he cried.</p>

<p id="id00577">"Yes, yes; now it is all clear, now it is all unravelled; and I see
why Saknussemm, put into the Index Expurgatorius, and compelled to
hide the discoveries made by his genius, was obliged to bury in an
incomprehensible cryptogram the secret&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00578">"What secret?" asked M. Fridrikssen, starting.</p>

<p id="id00579">"Oh, just a secret which&#8212;" my uncle stammered.</p>

<p id="id00580">"Have you some private document in your possession?" asked our host.</p>

<p id="id00581">"No; I was only supposing a case."</p>

<p id="id00582">"Oh, very well," answered M. Fridrikssen, who was kind enough not to
pursue the subject when he had noticed the embarrassment of his
friend. "I hope you will not leave our island until you have seen
some of its mineralogical wealth."</p>

<p id="id00583">"Certainly," replied my uncle; "but I am rather late; or have not
others been here before me?"</p>

<p id="id00584">"Yes, Herr Liedenbrock; the labours of MM. Olafsen and Povelsen,
pursued by order of the king, the researches of Tro&#239;l the scientific
mission of MM. Gaimard and Robert on the French corvette <i>La
Recherche,</i><a id="noteref-5" href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-7.html#note-5">[5]</a> and lately the observations of scientific men who
came in the <i>Reine Hortense,</i> have added materially to our knowledge
of Iceland. But I assure you there is plenty left."</p>

<p id="id00585">"Do you think so?" said my uncle, pretending to look very modest, and
trying to hide the curiosity was flashing out of his eyes.</p>

<p id="id00586">"Oh, yes; how many mountains, glaciers, and volcanoes there are to
study, which are as yet but imperfectly known! Then, without going
any further, that mountain in the horizon. That is Sn&#230;fell."</p>

<p id="id00587">"Ah!" said my uncle, as coolly as he was able, "is that Sn&#230;fell?"</p>

<p id="id00588">"Yes; one of the most curious volcanoes, and the crater of which has
scarcely ever been visited."</p>

<p id="id00589">"Is it extinct?"</p>

<p id="id00590">"Oh, yes; more than five hundred years."</p>

<p id="id00591">"Well," replied my uncle, who was frantically locking his legs together
to keep himself from jumping up in the air, "that is where I mean to
begin my geological studies, there on that Seffel&#8212;Fessel&#8212;what do you
call it?"</p>

<p id="id00592">"Sn&#230;fell," replied the excellent M. Fridrikssen.</p>

<p id="id00593">This part of the conversation was in Latin; I had understood every
word of it, and I could hardly conceal my amusement at seeing my
uncle trying to keep down the excitement and satisfaction which were
brimming over in every limb and every feature. He tried hard to put
on an innocent little expression of simplicity; but it looked like a
diabolical grin.</p>

<p id="id00595">"Yes," said he, "your words decide me. We will try to scale that<br/>

Sn&#230;fell; perhaps even we may pursue our studies in its crater!"<br/></p>

<p id="id00596">"I am very sorry," said M. Fridrikssen, "that my engagements will not
allow me to absent myself, or I would have accompanied you myself
with both pleasure and profit."</p>

<p id="id00597">"Oh, no, no!" replied my uncle with great animation, "we would not
disturb any one for the world, M. Fridrikssen. Still, I thank you
with all my heart: the company of such a talented man would have been
very serviceable, but the duties of your profession&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00598">I am glad to think that our host, in the innocence of his Icelandic
soul, was blind to the transparent artifices of my uncle.</p>

<p id="id00599">"I very much approve of your beginning with that volcano, M.<br/>

Liedenbrock. You will gather a harvest of interesting observations.<br/>

But, tell me, how do you expect to get to the peninsula of Sn&#230;fell?"<br/></p>

<p id="id00600">"By sea, crossing the bay. That's the most direct way."</p>

<p id="id00601">"No doubt; but it is impossible."</p>

<p id="id00602">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id00603">"Because we don't possess a single boat at Rejkiavik."</p>

<p id="id00604">"You don't mean to say so?"</p>

<p id="id00605">"You will have to go by land, following the shore. It will be longer,
but more interesting."</p>

<p id="id00606">"Very well, then; and now I shall have to see about a guide."</p>

<p id="id00607">"I have one to offer you."</p>

<p id="id00608">"A safe, intelligent man."</p>

<p id="id00609">"Yes; an inhabitant of that peninsula. He is an eider-down hunter, and
very clever. He speaks Danish perfectly."</p>

<p id="id00610">"When can I see him?"</p>

<p id="id00611">"To-morrow, if you like."</p>

<p id="id00612">"Why not to-day?"</p>

<p id="id00613">"Because he won't be here till to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id00614">"To-morrow, then," added my uncle with a sigh.</p>

<p id="id00615">This momentous conversation ended in a few minutes with warm
acknowledgments paid by the German to the Icelandic Professor. At
this dinner my uncle had just elicited important facts, amongst
others, the history of Saknussemm, the reason of the mysterious
document, that his host would not accompany him in his expedition,
and that the very next day a guide would be waiting upon him.</p>

<h6 id="id00617">A GUIDE FOUND TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH</h6>

<p id="id00618" style="margin-top: 2em">In the evening I took a short walk on the beach and returned at night
to my plank-bed, where I slept soundly all night.</p>

<p id="id00619">When I awoke I heard my uncle talking at a great rate in the next
room. I immediately dressed and joined him.</p>

<p id="id00620">He was conversing in the Danish language with a tall man, of robust
build. This fine fellow must have been possessed of great strength.
His eyes, set in a large and ingenuous face, seemed to me very
intelligent; they were of a dreamy sea-blue. Long hair, which would
have been called red even in England, fell in long meshes upon his
broad shoulders. The movements of this native were lithe and supple;
but he made little use of his arms in speaking, like a man who knew
nothing or cared nothing about the language of gestures. His whole
appearance bespoke perfect calmness and self-possession, not
indolence but tranquillity. It was felt at once that he would be
beholden to nobody, that he worked for his own convenience, and that
nothing in this world could astonish or disturb his philosophic
calmness.</p>

<p id="id00621">I caught the shades of this Icelander's character by the way in which
he listened to the impassioned flow of words which fell from the
Professor. He stood with arms crossed, perfectly unmoved by my
uncle's incessant gesticulations. A negative was expressed by a slow
movement of the head from left to right, an affirmative by a slight
bend, so slight that his long hair scarcely moved. He carried economy
of motion even to parsimony.</p>

<p id="id00622">Certainly I should never have dreamt in looking at this man that he
was a hunter; he did not look likely to frighten his game, nor did he
seem as if he would even get near it. But the mystery was explained
when M. Fridrikssen informed me that this tranquil personage was only
a hunter of the eider duck, whose under plumage constitutes the chief
wealth of the island. This is the celebrated eider down, and it
requires no great rapidity of movement to get it.</p>

<p id="id00623">Early in summer the female, a very pretty bird, goes to build her
nest among the rocks of the fiords with which the coast is fringed.
After building the nest she feathers it with down plucked from her
own breast. Immediately the hunter, or rather the trader, comes and
robs the nest, and the female recommences her work. This goes on as
long as she has any down left. When she has stripped herself bare the
male takes his turn to pluck himself. But as the coarse and hard
plumage of the male has no commercial value, the hunter does not take
the trouble to rob the nest of this; the female therefore lays her
eggs in the spoils of her mate, the young are hatched, and next year
the harvest begins again.</p>

<p id="id00624">Now, as the eider duck does not select steep cliffs for her nest, but
rather the smooth terraced rocks which slope to the sea, the
Icelandic hunter might exercise his calling without any inconvenient
exertion. He was a farmer who was not obliged either to sow or reap
his harvest, but merely to gather it in.</p>

<p id="id00625">This grave, phlegmatic, and silent individual was called Hans Bjelke;
and he came recommended by M. Fridrikssen. He was our future guide.
His manners were a singular contrast with my uncle's.</p>

<p id="id00626">Nevertheless, they soon came to understand each other. Neither looked
at the amount of the payment: the one was ready to accept whatever
was offered; the other was ready to give whatever was demanded. Never
was bargain more readily concluded.</p>

<p id="id00627">The result of the treaty was, that Hans engaged on his part to
conduct us to the village of Stapi, on the south shore of the Sn&#230;fell
peninsula, at the very foot of the volcano. By land this would be
about twenty-two miles, to be done, said my uncle, in two days.</p>

<p id="id00628">But when he learnt that the Danish mile was 24,000 feet long, he was
obliged to modify his calculations and allow seven or eight days for
the march.</p>

<p id="id00629">Four horses were to be placed at our disposal&#8212;two to carry him and
me, two for the baggage. Hams, as was his custom, would go on foot.
He knew all that part of the coast perfectly, and promised to take us
the shortest way.</p>

<p id="id00630">His engagement was not to terminate with our arrival at Stapi; he was
to continue in my uncle's service for the whole period of his
scientific researches, for the remuneration of three rixdales a week
(about twelve shillings), but it was an express article of the
covenant that his wages should be counted out to him every Saturday
at six o'clock in the evening, which, according to him, was one
indispensable part of the engagement.</p>

<p id="id00631">The start was fixed for the 16th of June. My uncle wanted to pay the
hunter a portion in advance, but he refused with one word:</p>

<p id="id00632">"<i>Efter,</i>" said he.</p>

<p id="id00633">"After," said the Professor for my edification.</p>

<p id="id00634">The treaty concluded, Hans silently withdrew.</p>

<p id="id00635">"A famous fellow," cried my uncle; "but he little thinks of the
marvellous part he has to play in the future."</p>

<p id="id00636">"So he is to go with us as far as&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id00637">"As far as the centre of the earth, Axel."</p>

<p id="id00638">Forty-eight hours were left before our departure; to my great regret
I had to employ them in preparations; for all our ingenuity was
required to pack every article to the best advantage; instruments
here, arms there, tools in this package, provisions in that: four
sets of packages in all.</p>

<p id="id00639">The instruments were:</p>

<p id="id00640">1. An Eigel's centigrade thermometer, graduated up to 150 degrees
(302 degrees Fahr.), which seemed to me too much or too little. Too
much if the internal heat was to rise so high, for in this case we
should be baked, not enough to measure the temperature of springs or
any matter in a state of fusion.</p>

<p id="id00641">2. An aneroid barometer, to indicate extreme pressures of the
atmosphere. An ordinary barometer would not have answered the
purpose, as the pressure would increase during our descent to a point
which the mercurial barometer<a id="noteref-6" href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-7.html#note-6">[6]</a> would not register.</p>

<p id="id00642">3. A chronometer, made by Boissonnas, jun., of Geneva, accurately set
to the meridian of Hamburg.</p>

<p id="id00643">4. Two compasses, viz., a common compass and a dipping needle.</p>

<p id="id00644">5. A night glass.</p>

<p id="id00645">6. Two of Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which, by means of an electric
current, supplied a safe and handy portable light<a id="noteref-7" href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-7.html#note-7">[7]</a></p>

<p id="id00646">The arms consisted of two of Purdy's rifles and two brace of pistols.
But what did we want arms for? We had neither savages nor wild beasts
to fear, I supposed. But my uncle seemed to believe in his arsenal as
in his instruments, and more especially in a considerable quantity of
gun cotton, which is unaffected by moisture, and the explosive force
of which exceeds that of gunpowder.</p>

<p id="id00649">The tools comprised two pickaxes, two spades, a silk ropeladder,
three iron-tipped sticks, a hatchet, a hammer, a dozen wedges and
iron spikes, and a long knotted rope. Now this was a large load, for
the ladder was 300 feet long.</p>

<p id="id00650">And there were provisions too: this was not a large parcel, but it
was comforting to know that of essence of beef and biscuits there
were six months' consumption. Spirits were the only liquid, and of
water we took none; but we had flasks, and my uncle depended on
springs from which to fill them. Whatever objections I hazarded as to
their quality, temperature, and even absence, remained ineffectual.</p>

<p id="id00651">To complete the exact inventory of all our travelling accompaniments,
I must not forget a pocket medicine chest, containing blunt scissors,
splints for broken limbs, a piece of tape of unbleached linen,
bandages and compresses, lint, a lancet for bleeding, all dreadful
articles to take with one. Then there was a row of phials containing
dextrine, alcoholic ether, liquid acetate of lead, vinegar, and
ammonia drugs which afforded me no comfort. Finally, all the articles
needful to supply Ruhmkorff's apparatus.</p>

<p id="id00652">My uncle did not forget a supply of tobacco, coarse grained powder,
and amadou, nor a leathern belt in which he carried a sufficient
quantity of gold, silver, and paper money. Six pairs of boots and
shoes, made waterproof with a composition of indiarubber and naphtha,
were packed amongst the tools.</p>

<p id="id00653">"Clothed, shod, and equipped like this," said my uncle, "there is no
telling how far we may go."</p>

<p id="id00654">The 14th was wholly spent in arranging all our different articles. In
the evening we dined with Baron Tramps; the mayor of Rejkiavik, and
Dr. Hyaltalin, the first medical man of the place, being of the
party. M. Fridrikssen was not there. I learned afterwards that he and
the Governor disagreed upon some question of administration, and did
not speak to each other. I therefore knew not a single word of all
that was said at this semi-official dinner; but I could not help
noticing that my uncle talked the whole time.</p>

<p id="id00655">On the 15th our preparations were all made. Our host gave the
Professor very great pleasure by presenting him with a map of Iceland
far more complete than that of Hendersen. It was the map of M. Olaf
Nikolas Olsen, in the proportion of 1 to 480,000 of the actual size
of the island, and published by the Icelandic Literary Society. It
was a precious document for a mineralogist.</p>

<p id="id00656">Our last evening was spent in intimate conversation with M.
Fridrikssen, with whom I felt the liveliest sympathy; then, after the
talk, succeeded, for me, at any rate, a disturbed and restless night.</p>

<p id="id00657">At five in the morning I was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four
horses under my window. I dressed hastily and came down into the
street. Hans was finishing our packing, almost as it were without
moving a limb; and yet he did his work cleverly. My uncle made more
noise than execution, and the guide seemed to pay very little
attention to his energetic directions.</p>

<p id="id00658">At six o'clock our preparations were over. M. Fridrikssen shook hands
with us. My uncle thanked him heartily for his extreme kindness. I
constructed a few fine Latin sentences to express my cordial
farewell. Then we bestrode our steeds and with his last adieu M.
Fridrikssen treated me to a line of Virgil eminently applicable to
such uncertain wanderers as we were likely to be:</p>

<p id="id00659">"Et quacumque viam dedent fortuna sequamur."</p>

<p id="id00660">"Therever fortune clears a way,<br/>

Thither our ready footsteps stray."<br/></p>
