<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00087"><span class="c9">Chapter III. A Little Demon</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Going in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair, in which she had been wheeled when she was unable to walk. She did not move to meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were simply riveted on his face. There was a feverish look in her eyes, her face was pale and yellow. Alyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in three days. She was positively thinner. She did not hold out her hand to him. He touched the thin, long fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he sat down facing her, without a word.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,&#8221;</span> Lise said curtly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and mamma's kept you there for hours; she's just been telling you about me and Yulia.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen and I do listen, there's no harm in that. I don't apologize.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are upset about something?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;On the contrary, I am very happy. I've only just been reflecting for the thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be your wife. You are not fit to be a husband. If I were to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved after you, you'd take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an answer back, too. If you were forty, you would still go on taking my love-letters for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She suddenly laughed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,&#8221;</span> Alyosha smiled to her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you. What's more, I don't want to feel ashamed with you, just with you. Alyosha, why is it I don't respect you? I am very fond of you, but I don't respect you. If I respected you, I shouldn't talk to you without shame, should I?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page655"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg655"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I don't believe it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Lise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison. Alyosha, you know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully for having so quickly allowed me not to love you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why did you send for me to-day, Lise?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one to torture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go away. I don't want to be happy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are in love with disorder?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house. I keep imagining how I'll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly; it must be on the sly. They'll try to put it out, but it'll go on burning. And I shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness! And how bored I am!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She waved her hand with a look of repulsion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's your luxurious life,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, softly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is it better, then, to be poor?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, it is better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's what your monk taught you. That's not true. Let me be rich and all the rest poor, I'll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to any one else. Ach, don't speak, don't say anything,&#8221;</span> she shook her hand at him, though Alyosha had not opened his mouth. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've told me all that before, I know it all by heart. It bores me. If I am ever poor, I shall murder somebody, and even if I am rich, I may murder some one, perhaps&#8212;why do nothing! But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I'll marry you, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we'll keep a colt, shall we? Do you know Kalganov?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why live in real life? It's better to dream. One can dream the most delightful things, but real life is a bore.&#8217;</span> But he'll be married soon for all that; he's been making love to me already. Can you spin tops?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, he's just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set spinning <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page656"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg656"></a> and then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I marry him, I'll keep him spinning all his life. You are not ashamed to be with me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are awfully cross, because I don't talk about holy things. I don't want to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world for the greatest sin? You must know all about that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God will censure you.&#8221;</span> Alyosha was watching her steadily.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's just what I should like. I would go up and they would censure me, and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should dreadfully like to set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you still don't believe me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing to set fire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It's a sort of disease.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's not true, that's not true; there may be children, but that's not what I mean.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You take evil for good; it's a passing crisis, it's the result of your illness, perhaps.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You do despise me, though! It's simply that I don't want to do good, I want to do evil, and it has nothing to do with illness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why do evil?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would be if everything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly every one would find it out. Every one will stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all. That would be awfully nice. Why would it be so nice, Alyosha?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know. It's a craving to destroy something good or, as you say, to set fire to something. It happens sometimes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I not only say it, I shall do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I believe you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not lying one little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose to annoy you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I don't think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to do that in it, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page657"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg657"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is a little. I never can tell lies to you,&#8221;</span> she declared, with a strange fire in her eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness. There was not a trace of humor or jesting in her face now, though, in old days, fun and gayety never deserted her even at her most <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;earnest&#8221;</span> moments.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There are moments when people love crime,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one loves crime, they love it always, not at some <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;moments.&#8217;</span> You know, it's as though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about it ever since. They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly they all love it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And are you still reading nasty books?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I steal them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Aren't you ashamed to destroy yourself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I want to destroy myself. There's a boy here, who lay down between the railway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow! Listen, your brother is being tried now for murdering his father and every one loves his having killed his father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Loves his having killed his father?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says it's so awful, but secretly they simply love it. I for one love it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is some truth in what you say about every one,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha softly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, what ideas you have!&#8221;</span> Lise shrieked in delight. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you a monk, too! You wouldn't believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for never telling lies. Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I sometimes dream of devils. It's night; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place, in all the corners, under the table, and they open the doors; there's a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me. And they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross myself and they all draw back, though they don't go away altogether, they stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have a frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then they come crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page658"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg658"></a> I cross myself again and they all draw back. It's awful fun. it takes one's breath away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've had the same dream, too,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Really?&#8221;</span> cried Lise, surprised. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I say, Alyosha, don't laugh, that's awfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It seems they can.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, I tell you, it's awfully important,&#8221;</span> Lise went on, with really excessive amazement. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's not the dream that's important, but your having the same dream as me. You never lie to me, don't lie now: is it true? You are not laughing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was silent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,&#8221;</span> she said suddenly, in a supplicating voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll always come to see you, all my life,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha firmly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are the only person I can talk to, you know,&#8221;</span> Lise began again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I talk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole world. And to you more readily than to myself. And I am not a bit ashamed with you, not a bit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit? Alyosha, is it true that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew, who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands, and then crucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him and crucified him, and afterwards, when he was tried, he said that the child died soon, within four hours. That was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;soon&#8217;</span>! He said the child moaned, kept on moaning and he stood admiring it. That's nice!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nice?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him. He would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">compote</span></span>. I am awfully fond of pineapple <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">compote</span></span>. Do you like it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was suddenly contorted, her eyes burned.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page659"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg659"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night. I kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a child of four years old understands, you know), and all the while the thought of pineapple <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">compote</span></span> haunted me. In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person, begging him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">particularly</span></em> to come and see me. He came and I suddenly told him all about the child and the pineapple <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">compote</span></span>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">All</span></em> about it, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">all</span></em>, and said that it was nice. He laughed and said it really was nice. Then he got up and went away. He was only here five minutes. Did he despise me? Did he despise me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he despise me or not?&#8221;</span> She sat up on the couch, with flashing eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tell me,&#8221;</span> Alyosha asked anxiously, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;did you send for that person?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Did you send him a letter?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Simply to ask about that, about that child?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, not about that at all. But when he came, I asked him about that at once. He answered, laughed, got up and went away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That person behaved honorably,&#8221;</span> Alyosha murmured.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And did he despise me? Did he laugh at me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, for perhaps he believes in the pineapple <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">compote</span></span> himself. He is very ill now, too, Lise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he does believe in it,&#8221;</span> said Lise, with flashing eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He doesn't despise any one,&#8221;</span> Alyosha went on. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only he does not believe any one. If he doesn't believe in people, of course, he does despise them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then he despises me, me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good,&#8221;</span> Lise seemed to grind her teeth. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When he went out laughing, I felt that it was nice to be despised. The child with fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is nice....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And she laughed in Alyosha's face, a feverish malicious laugh.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like&#8212;Alyosha, save me!&#8221;</span> She suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and seized him with both hands. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Save me!&#8221;</span> she almost groaned. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is there any one in the world I could tell what I've told you? I've told you the truth, the truth. I shall kill myself, because I loathe <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page660"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg660"></a> everything! I don't want to live, because I loathe everything! I loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don't you love me in the least?&#8221;</span> she finished in a frenzy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I do love you!&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha warmly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And will you weep over me, will you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not because I won't be your wife, but simply weep for me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thank you! It's only your tears I want. Every one else may punish me and trample me under foot, every one, every one, not excepting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">any one</span></em>. For I don't love any one. Do you hear, not any one! On the contrary, I hate him! Go, Alyosha; it's time you went to your brother&#8221;</span>; she tore herself away from him suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How can I leave you like this?&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, almost in alarm.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here's your hat. Give my love to Mitya, go, go!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He looked at her with pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his right hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed. He glanced at it and instantly read the address, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov.&#8221;</span> He looked quickly at Lise. Her face had become almost menacing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give it to him, you must give it to him!&#8221;</span> she ordered him, trembling and beside herself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To-day, at once, or I'll poison myself! That's why I sent for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha put the note in his pocket and went straight downstairs, without going back to Madame Hohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon as Alyosha had gone, Lise unbolted the door, opened it a little, put her finger in the crack and slammed the door with all her might, pinching her finger. Ten seconds after, releasing her finger, she walked softly, slowly to her chair, sat up straight in it and looked intently at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed from under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she kept whispering rapidly to herself:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha rang at the prison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But Alyosha knew that he would be admitted without difficulty. Things were managed in our little town, as everywhere else. At first, of course, on the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, relations and a few other persons could only obtain interviews with Mitya by going through certain inevitable formalities. But later, though the formalities were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, at least, of Mitya's visitors. So much so, that sometimes the interviews with the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">These exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka, Alyosha and Rakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the police, Mihail Mihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka. His abuse of her at Mokroe weighed on the old man's conscience, and when he learned the whole story, he completely changed his view of her. And strange to say, though he was firmly persuaded of his guilt, yet after Mitya was once in prison, the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was a man of good heart, perhaps,&#8221;</span> he thought, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;who had come to grief from drinking and dissipation.&#8221;</span> His first horror had been succeeded by pity. As for Alyosha, the police captain was very fond of him and had known him for a long time. Rakitin, who had of late taken to coming very often to see the prisoner, was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;police captain's young ladies,&#8221;</span> as he called them, and was always hanging about their house. He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent, too, who, though scrupulous in the performance of his duties, was a kind-hearted old man. Alyosha, again, had an intimate acquaintance of long standing with the superintendent, who was fond of talking to him, generally on sacred subjects. He respected Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in awe of his opinion, though he was a great philosopher himself; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;self-taught,&#8221;</span> of course. But <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page662"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg662"></a> Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for him. During the last year the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal Gospels, and constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend. He used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours together with him and with the monks. So even if Alyosha were late at the prison, he had only to go to the superintendent and everything was made easy. Besides, every one in the prison, down to the humblest warder, had grown used to Alyosha. The sentry, of course, did not trouble him so long as the authorities were satisfied.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went downstairs, to the place set aside for interviews. As Alyosha entered the room he came upon Rakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya. They were both talking loudly. Mitya was laughing heartily as he saw him out, while Rakitin seemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha, especially of late. He scarcely spoke to him, and bowed to him stiffly. Seeing Alyosha enter now, he frowned and looked away, as though he were entirely absorbed in buttoning his big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat. Then he began looking at once for his umbrella.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I must mind not to forget my belongings,&#8221;</span> he muttered, simply to say something.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mind you don't forget other people's belongings,&#8221;</span> said Mitya, as a joke, and laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up instantly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You'd better give that advice to your own family, who've always been a slave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin,&#8221;</span> he cried, suddenly trembling with anger.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's the matter? I was joking,&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Damn it all! They are all like that,&#8221;</span> he turned to Alyosha, nodding towards Rakitin's hurriedly retreating figure. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was sitting here, laughing and cheerful, and all at once he boils up like that. He didn't even nod to you. Have you broken with him completely? Why are you so late? I've not been simply waiting, but thirsting for you the whole morning. But never mind. We'll make up for it now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great friends?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through which Rakitin had disappeared.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page663"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg663"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it likely&#8212;a pig like that? He considers I am ... a blackguard. They can't understand a joke either, that's the worst of such people. They never understand a joke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat; they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here. But he is a clever fellow, very clever. Well, Alexey, it's all over with me now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, the trial's to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?&#8221;</span> Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</span> said Mitya, looking at him rather uncertainly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we've been talking of things that don't matter, about this trial, but I haven't said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to-morrow; but it wasn't the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean, Mitya?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ideas, ideas, that's all! Ethics! What is ethics?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ethics?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha, wondering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes; is it a science?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can't explain to you what sort of science it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He's not going to be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he'll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career, too. Ough! they are first-rate, these people, at making a career! Damn ethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than any one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Karl Bernard?&#8221;</span> Alyosha was surprised again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was he? Chemist or what?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He must be a savant,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but I confess I can't tell you much about him, either. I've heard of him as a savant, but what sort I don't know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, damn him, then! I don't know either,&#8221;</span> swore Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A scoundrel of some sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels. And Rakitin will make his way. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page664"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg664"></a> is another Bernard. Ugh, these Bernards! They are all over the place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what is the matter?&#8221;</span> Alyosha asked insistently.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so begin his literary career. That's what he comes for; he said so himself. He wants to prove some theory. He wants to say <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;he couldn't help murdering his father, he was corrupted by his environment,&#8217;</span> and so on. He explained it all to me. He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But there, damn the fellow, he can put in a tinge if he likes, I don't care. He can't bear Ivan, he hates him. He's not fond of you, either. But I don't turn him out, for he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited, though. I said to him just now, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosophers; for all true Russians are philosophers, and though you've studied, you are not a philosopher&#8212;you are a low fellow.&#8217;</span> He laughed, so maliciously. And I said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;<span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span class="c19">De ideabus non est disputandum</span></span>.&#8217;</span> Isn't that rather good? I can set up for being a classic, you see!&#8221;</span> Mitya laughed suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why is it all over with you? You said so just now,&#8221;</span> Alyosha interposed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why is it all over with me? H'm!... The fact of it is ... if you take it as a whole, I am sorry to lose God&#8212;that's why it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean by <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;sorry to lose God&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in the head&#8212;that is, these nerves are there in the brain ... (damn them!) there are sort of little tails, the little tails of those nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering ... that is, you see, I look at something with my eyes and then they begin quivering, those little tails ... and when they quiver, then an image appears ... it doesn't appear at once, but an instant, a second, passes ... and then something like a moment appears; that is, not a moment&#8212;devil take the moment!&#8212;but an image; that is, an object, or an action, damn it! That's why I see and then think, because of those tails, not at all because I've got a soul, and that I am some sort of image and likeness. All that is nonsense! Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, brother, and it simply bowled me over. It's magnificent, Alyosha, this science! A new man's arising&#8212;that I understand.... And yet I am sorry to lose God!&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page665"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg665"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, that's a good thing, anyway,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That I am sorry to lose God? It's chemistry, brother, chemistry! There's no help for it, your reverence, you must make way for chemistry. And Rakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesn't he dislike Him! That's the sore point with all of them. But they conceal it. They tell lies. They pretend. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Will you preach this in your reviews?&#8217;</span> I asked him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Oh, well, if I did it openly, they won't let it through,&#8217;</span> he said. He laughed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;But what will become of men then?&#8217;</span> I asked him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Didn't you know?&#8217;</span> he said laughing, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;a clever man can do what he likes,&#8217;</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;A clever man knows his way about, but you've put your foot in it, committing a murder, and now you are rotting in prison.&#8217;</span> He says that to my face! A regular pig! I used to kick such people out, but now I listen to them. He talks a lot of sense, too. Writes well. He began reading me an article last week. I copied out three lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to put one's personality in contradiction to one's reality.&#8217;</span> Do you understand that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I don't,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha. He looked at Mitya and listened to him with curiosity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't understand either. It's dark and obscure, but intellectual. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Every one writes like that now,&#8217;</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;it's the effect of their environment.&#8217;</span> They are afraid of the environment. He writes poetry, too, the rascal. He's written in honor of Madame Hohlakov's foot. Ha ha ha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've heard about it,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you? And have you heard the poem?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've got it. Here it is. I'll read it to you. You don't know&#8212;I haven't told you&#8212;there's quite a story about it. He's a rascal! Three weeks ago he began to tease me. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You've got yourself into a mess, like a fool, for the sake of three thousand, but I'm going to collar a hundred and fifty thousand. I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg.&#8217;</span> And he told me he was courting <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page666"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg666"></a> Madame Hohlakov. She hadn't much brains in her youth, and now at forty she has lost what she had. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;But she's awfully sentimental,&#8217;</span> he says; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;that's how I shall get hold of her. When I marry her, I shall take her to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.&#8217;</span> And his mouth was simply watering, the beast, not for the widow, but for the hundred and fifty thousand. And he made me believe it. He came to see me every day. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;She is coming round,&#8217;</span> he declared. He was beaming with delight. And then, all of a sudden, he was turned out of the house. Perhotin's carrying everything before him, bravo! I could kiss the silly old noodle for turning him out of the house. And he had written this doggerel. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's the first time I've soiled my hands with writing poetry,&#8217;</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's to win her heart, so it's in a good cause. When I get hold of the silly woman's fortune, I can be of great social utility.&#8217;</span> They have this social justification for every nasty thing they do! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Anyway it's better than your Pushkin's poetry,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;for I've managed to advocate enlightenment even in that.&#8217;</span> I understand what he means about Pushkin, I quite see that, if he really was a man of talent and only wrote about women's feet. But wasn't Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel! The vanity of these fellows! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object of my affections&#8217;</span>&#8212;he thought of that for a title. He's a waggish fellow.</span></p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">

<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">A captivating little foot,</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">He is a pig, a regular pig, but he's very arch, the rascal! And he really has put in a progressive idea. And wasn't he angry when she kicked him out! He was gnashing his teeth!&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page667"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg667"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's taken his revenge already,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's written a paragraph about Madame Hohlakov.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Gossip</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's his doing, that's his doing!&#8221;</span> Mitya assented, frowning. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's him! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have been written about Grushenka, for instance.... And about Katya, too.... H'm!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He walked across the room with a harassed air.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother, I cannot stay long,&#8221;</span> Alyosha said, after a pause. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To-morrow will be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be accomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of I don't know what ...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, don't be amazed at me,&#8221;</span> Mitya broke in warmly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Am I to talk of that stinking dog? Of the murderer? We've talked enough of him. I don't want to say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, you will see. Hush!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes glowed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Rakitin wouldn't understand it,&#8221;</span> he began in a sort of exaltation; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but you, you'll understand it all. That's why I was thirsting for you. You see, there's so much I've been wanting to tell you for ever so long, here, within these peeling walls, but I haven't said a word about what matters most; the moment never seems to have come. Now I can wait no longer. I must pour out my heart to you. Brother, these last two months I've found in myself a new man. A new man has risen up in me. He was hidden in me, but would never have come to the surface, if it hadn't been for this blow from heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care if I spend twenty years in the mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am not a bit afraid of that&#8212;it's something else I am afraid of now: that that new man may leave me. Even there, in the mines, under-ground, I may find a human heart in another convict and murderer by my side, and I may make friends with him, for even there one may live and love and suffer. One may thaw and revive a frozen heart in that convict, one may wait upon him for years, and at last bring up from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; one may bring forth an angel, create a hero! There are so many of them, hundreds of them, and we are all to blame for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page668"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg668"></a> them. Why was it I dreamed of that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;babe&#8217;</span> at such a moment? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why is the babe so poor?&#8217;</span> That was a sign to me at that moment. It's for the babe I'm going. Because we are all responsible for all. For all the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;babes,&#8217;</span> for there are big children as well as little children. All are <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;babes.&#8217;</span> I go for all, because some one must go for all. I didn't kill father, but I've got to go. I accept it. It's all come to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There are numbers of them there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in their hands. Oh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom, but then, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without which man cannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy: it's His privilege&#8212;a grand one. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer! What should I be underground there without God? Rakitin's laughing! If they drive God from the earth, we shall shelter Him underground. One cannot exist in prison without God; it's even more impossible than out of prison. And then we men underground will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to God, with Whom is joy. Hail to God and His joy! I love Him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech. He turned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, life is full, there is life even underground,&#8221;</span> he began again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You wouldn't believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a thirst for existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these peeling walls. Rakitin doesn't understand that; all he cares about is building a house and letting flats. But I've been longing for you. And what is suffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it were beyond reckoning. I am not afraid of it now. I was afraid of it before. Do you know, perhaps I won't answer at the trial at all.... And I seem to have such strength in me now, that I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I exist.&#8217;</span> In thousands of agonies&#8212;I exist. I'm tormented on the rack&#8212;but I exist! Though I sit alone on a pillar&#8212;I exist! I see the sun, and if I don't see the sun, I know it's there. And there's a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there. Alyosha, my angel, all these philosophies are the death of me. Damn them! Brother Ivan&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What of brother Ivan?&#8221;</span> interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did not hear.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page669"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg669"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all hidden away in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand were surging up in me, that I used to drink and fight and rage. It was to stifle them in myself, to still them, to smother them. Ivan is not Rakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is a sphinx and is silent; he is always silent. It's God that's worrying me. That's the only thing that's worrying me. What if He doesn't exist? What if Rakitin's right&#8212;that it's an idea made up by men? Then if He doesn't exist, man is the chief of the earth, of the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he going to be good without God? That's the question. I always come back to that. For whom is man going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will he sing the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love humanity without God. Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that. I can't understand it. Life's easy for Rakitin. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You'd better think about the extension of civic rights, or even of keeping down the price of meat. You will show your love for humanity more simply and directly by that, than by philosophy.&#8217;</span> I answered him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Well, but you, without a God, are more likely to raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on every copeck.&#8217;</span> He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness? Answer me that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman, so it's a relative thing. Or isn't it? Is it not relative? A treacherous question! You won't laugh if I tell you it's kept me awake two nights. I only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it. Vanity! Ivan has no God. He has an idea. It's beyond me. But he is silent. I believe he is a free-mason. I asked him, but he is silent. I wanted to drink from the springs of his soul&#8212;he was silent. But once he did drop a word.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</span> Alyosha took it up quickly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Then everything is lawful, if it is so?&#8217;</span> He frowned. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;was a pig, but his ideas were right enough.&#8217;</span> That was what he dropped. That was all he said. That was going one better than Rakitin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes,&#8221;</span> Alyosha assented bitterly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When was he with you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said nothing about Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When my business here is over and the verdict has been given, then I'll <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page670"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg670"></a> tell you something. I'll tell you everything. We've something tremendous on hand.... And you shall be my judge in it. But don't begin about that now; be silent. You talk of to-morrow, of the trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you talked to the counsel?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's the use of the counsel? I told him all about it. He's a soft, city-bred rogue&#8212;a Bernard! But he doesn't believe me&#8212;not a bit of it. Only imagine, he believes I did it. I see it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;In that case,&#8217;</span> I asked him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;why have you come to defend me?&#8217;</span> Hang them all! They've got a doctor down, too, want to prove I'm mad. I won't have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants to do her <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;duty&#8217;</span> to the end, whatever the strain!&#8221;</span> Mitya smiled bitterly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The cat! Hard-hearted creature! She knows that I said of her at Mokroe that she was a woman of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;great wrath.&#8217;</span> They repeated it. Yes, the facts against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea. Grigory sticks to his point. Grigory's honest, but a fool. Many people are honest because they are fools: that's Rakitin's idea. Grigory's my enemy. And there are some people who are better as foes than friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna. I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand. She'll pay it back to the last farthing. I don't want her sacrifice; they'll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how I can stand it. Go to her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in the court, can't you? But damn it all, it doesn't matter! I shall get through somehow. I don't pity her. It's her own doing. She deserves what she gets. I shall have my own story to tell, Alexey.&#8221;</span> He smiled bitterly again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only ... only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why should she have such suffering to bear?&#8221;</span> he exclaimed suddenly, with tears. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Grusha's killing me; the thought of her's killing me, killing me. She was with me just now....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She told me she was very much grieved by you to-day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know. Confound my temper! It was jealousy. I was sorry, I kissed her as she was going. I didn't ask her forgiveness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why didn't you?&#8221;</span> exclaimed Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Suddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness for a fault from a woman you love. From one you love especially, however greatly you may have been in fault. For a woman&#8212;devil <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page671"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg671"></a> only knows what to make of a woman! I know something about them, anyway. But try acknowledging you are in fault to a woman. Say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am sorry, forgive me,&#8217;</span> and a shower of reproaches will follow! Nothing will make her forgive you simply and directly, she'll humble you to the dust, bring forward things that have never happened, recall everything, forget nothing, add something of her own, and only then forgive you. And even the best, the best of them do it. She'll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head. They are ready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all these angels without whom we cannot live! I tell you plainly and openly, dear boy, every decent man ought to be under some woman's thumb. That's my conviction&#8212;not conviction, but feeling. A man ought to be magnanimous, and it's no disgrace to a man! No disgrace to a hero, not even a C&#230;sar! But don't ever beg her pardon all the same for anything. Remember that rule given you by your brother Mitya, who's come to ruin through women. No, I'd better make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I worship her, Alexey, worship her. Only she doesn't see it. No, she still thinks I don't love her enough. And she tortures me, tortures me with her love. The past was nothing! In the past it was only those infernal curves of hers that tortured me, but now I've taken all her soul into my soul and through her I've become a man myself. Will they marry us? If they don't, I shall die of jealousy. I imagine something every day.... What did she say to you about me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya listened, made him repeat things, and seemed pleased.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then she is not angry at my being jealous?&#8221;</span> he exclaimed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She is a regular woman! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I've a fierce heart myself!&#8217;</span> Ah, I love such fierce hearts, though I can't bear any one's being jealous of me. I can't endure it. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her infinitely. Will they marry us? Do they let convicts marry? That's the question. And without her I can't exist....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark. He suddenly seemed terribly worried.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So there's a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot against her, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good Grushenka, that's not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page672"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg672"></a> foolish feminine way. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I'll tell you our secret!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing before him, and whispered to him with an air of mystery, though in reality no one could hear them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will tell you all our secret,&#8221;</span> Mitya whispered hurriedly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I meant to tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you? You are everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are my angel. It's your decision will decide it. Perhaps it's you that is superior and not Ivan. You see, it's a question of conscience, question of the higher conscience&#8212;the secret is so important that I can't settle it myself, and I've put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway it's too early to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the verdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Don't decide it now. I'll tell you now. You listen, but don't decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won't tell you everything. I'll only tell you the idea, without details, and you keep quiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, what shall I do with your eyes? I'm afraid your eyes will tell me your decision, even if you don't speak. Oo! I'm afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan suggests my <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">escaping</span></em>. I won't tell you the details: it's all been thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don't decide. I should go to America with Grusha. You know I can't live without Grusha! What if they won't let her follow me to Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivan thinks not. And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a hammer? I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the other hand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering. A sign has come, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on it. Ivan says that in America, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;with the good-will,&#8217;</span> I can be of more use than underground. But what becomes of our hymn from underground? What's America? America is vanity again! And there's a lot of swindling in America, too, I expect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I tell you, you know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can understand this. There's no one else. It's folly, madness to others, all I've told <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page673"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg673"></a> you of the hymn. They'll say I'm out of my mind or a fool. I am not out of my mind and I am not a fool. Ivan understands about the hymn, too. He understands, only he doesn't answer&#8212;he doesn't speak. He doesn't believe in the hymn. Don't speak, don't speak. I see how you look! You have already decided. Don't decide, spare me! I can't live without Grusha. Wait till after the trial!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with both hands on his shoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his brother's.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They don't let convicts marry, do they?&#8221;</span> he repeated for the third time in a supplicating voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tell me one thing,&#8221;</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose idea was it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;His, his, and he is very keen on it. He didn't come to see me at first, then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away. He is awfully keen on it. He doesn't ask me, but orders me to escape. He doesn't doubt of my obeying him, though I showed him all my heart as I have to you, and told him about the hymn, too. He told me he'd arrange it; he's found out about everything. But of that later. He's simply set on it. It's all a matter of money: he'll pay ten thousand for escape and give me twenty thousand for America. And he says we can arrange a magnificent escape for ten thousand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And he told you on no account to tell me?&#8221;</span> Alyosha asked again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you. He is afraid, no doubt, that you'll stand before me as my conscience. Don't tell him I told you. Don't tell him, for anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are right,&#8221;</span> Alyosha pronounced; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;it's impossible to decide anything before the trial is over. After the trial you'll decide of yourself. Then you'll find that new man in yourself and he will decide.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A new man, or a Bernard who'll decide <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">&#224; la</span></span> Bernard, for I believe I'm a contemptible Bernard myself,&#8221;</span> said Mitya, with a bitter grin.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page674"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg674"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, darling, it's time you were going,&#8221;</span> he said, with a sudden haste. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's the superintendent shouting in the yard. He'll be here directly. We are late; it's irregular. Embrace me quickly. Kiss me! Sign me with the cross, darling, for the cross I have to bear to-morrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They embraced and kissed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan,&#8221;</span> said Mitya suddenly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;suggests my escaping; but, of course, he believes I did it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A mournful smile came on to his lips.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you asked him whether he believes it?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I haven't. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I hadn't the courage. But I saw it from his eyes. Well, good-by!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Once more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out, when Mitya suddenly called him back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stand facing me! That's right!&#8221;</span> And again he seized Alyosha, putting both hands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so that it was dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness. His lips twitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do you believe I did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole truth, don't lie!&#8221;</span> he cried desperately.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something like a stab at his heart.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hush! What do you mean?&#8221;</span> he faltered helplessly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The whole truth, the whole, don't lie!&#8221;</span> repeated Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!&#8221;</span> broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha's breast, and he raised his right hand in the air, as though calling God to witness his words.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya's whole face was lighted up with bliss.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</span> he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape him after fainting. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now you have given me new life. Would you believe it, till this moment I've been afraid to ask you, you, even you. Well, go! You've given me strength for to-morrow. God bless you! Come, go along! Love Ivan!&#8221;</span> was Mitya's last word.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page675"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg675"></a> lack of confidence even to him, to Alyosha&#8212;all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Love Ivan!&#8221;</span>&#8212;he suddenly recalled Mitya's words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now.</p>
