<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00021"><span class="c9">Chapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&#8212;In Anecdote</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I spent several thousand roubles in seducing young girls. That's a swinish invention, and there was nothing of the sort. And if there was, I didn't need money simply for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">that</span></em>. With me money is an accessory, the overflow of my heart, the framework. To-day she would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out of the streets in her place. I entertained them both. I threw away money by the handful on music, rioting, and gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to the ladies, too, for they'll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be pleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all of them, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked side-paths, little dark back-alleys behind the main road&#8212;there one finds adventures and surprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I am speaking figuratively, brother. In the town I was in, there were no such back-alleys in the literal sense, but morally there were. If you were like me, you'd know what that means. I loved vice, I loved the ignominy of vice. I loved cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov! Once we went, a whole lot of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was dark, it was winter, and I began squeezing a girl's hand, and forced her to kiss me. She was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle, submissive creature. She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She thought, poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer (I was looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn't say a word to her for five months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we were always having dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how they glowed with fire&#8212;a fire of gentle indignation. This game <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg116"></a> only tickled that insect lust I cherished in my soul. Five months later she married an official and left the town, still angry, and still, perhaps, in love with me. Now they live happily. Observe that I told no one. I didn't boast of it. Though I'm full of low desires, and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable. You're blushing; your eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this was nothing much&#8212;wayside blossoms <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">&#224; la</span></span> Paul de Kock&#8212;though the cruel insect had already grown strong in my soul. I've a perfect album of reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I tried to break it off without quarreling. And I never gave them away. I never bragged of one of them. But that's enough. You can't suppose I brought you here simply to talk of such nonsense. No, I'm going to tell you something more curious; and don't be surprised that I'm glad to tell you, instead of being ashamed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You say that because I blushed,&#8221;</span> Alyosha said suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wasn't blushing at what you were saying or at what you've done. I blushed because I am the same as you are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You? Come, that's going a little too far!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, it's not too far,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea was not a new one). <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The ladder's the same. I'm at the bottom step, and you're above, somewhere about the thirteenth. That's how I see it. But it's all the same. Absolutely the same in kind. Any one on the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then one ought not to step on at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Any one who can help it had better not.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But can you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you touch me so. That rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told me once that she'd devour you one day. There, there, I won't! From this field of corruption fouled by flies, let's pass to my tragedy, also befouled by flies, that is by every sort of vileness. Although the old man told lies about my seducing innocence, there really was something of the sort in my tragedy, though it was only once, and then it did not come off. The old man who has reproached me with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I never told any one about it. You're the first, except Ivan, of course&#8212;Ivan <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg117"></a> knows everything. He knew about it long before you. But Ivan's a tomb.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan's a tomb?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha listened with great attention.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision, like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in the little town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be rich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased them in other ways as well. Although they shook their heads over me, they liked me. My colonel, who was an old man, took a sudden dislike to me. He was always down upon me, but I had powerful friends, and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he couldn't do me much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him with proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two wives, both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left a daughter as unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of four and twenty when I was there, and was living with her father and an aunt, her mother's sister. The aunt was simple and illiterate; the niece was simple but lively. I like to say nice things about people. I never knew a woman of more charming character than Agafya&#8212;fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna! And she wasn't bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with a full figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had not married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but was as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;that&#8217;</span> way, it was pure friendship. I have often been friendly with women quite innocently. I used to talk to her with shocking frankness, and she only laughed. Many women like such freedom, and she was a girl too, which made it very amusing. Another thing, one could never think of her as a young lady. She and her aunt lived in her father's house with a sort of voluntary humility, not putting themselves on an equality with other people. She was a general favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever dressmaker. She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely without asking for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didn't refuse. The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg118"></a> of the chief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained the whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I arrived and joined the battalion, all the town was talking of the expected return of the colonel's second daughter, a great beauty, who had just left a fashionable school in the capital. This second daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she was the child of the second wife, who belonged to a distinguished general's family; although, as I learnt on good authority, she too brought the colonel no money. She had connections, and that was all. There may have been expectations, but they had come to nothing.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit, the whole town revived. Our most distinguished ladies&#8212;two <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Excellencies&#8217;</span> and a colonel's wife&#8212;and all the rest following their lead, at once took her up and gave entertainments in her honor. She was the belle of the balls and picnics, and they got up <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">tableaux vivants</span></span> in aid of distressed governesses. I took no notice, I went on as wildly as before, and one of my exploits at the time set all the town talking. I saw her eyes taking my measure one evening at the battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her, as though I disdained her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at an evening party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressed her lips scornfully. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Wait a bit. I'll have my revenge,&#8217;</span> thought I. I behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I was conscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Katenka&#8217;</span> was not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a person of character, proud and really high-principled; above all, she had education and intellect, and I had neither. You think I meant to make her an offer? No, I simply wanted to revenge myself, because I was such a hero and she didn't seem to feel it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel put me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed giving up all claims upon him&#8212;settling our accounts, so to speak, and saying that I wouldn't expect anything more. I didn't understand a word of it at the time. Until I came here, Alyosha, till the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I haven't been able to make head or tail of my money affairs with father. But never mind that, we'll talk of it later.</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg119"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling me something that interested me immensely. The authorities, I learnt, were dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected of irregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise for him. And then the commander of the division arrived, and kicked up the devil of a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was ordered to retire. I won't tell you how it all happened. He had enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked coolness in the town towards him and all his family. His friends all turned their backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya Ivanovna, with whom I'd always kept up a friendship, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Do you know there's a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your father's accounts?&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general was here not long ago, and everything was all right.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Then it was, but now it isn't.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She was terribly scared.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Don't frighten me!&#8217;</span> she said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Who told you so?&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Don't be uneasy,&#8217;</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I won't tell any one. You know I'm as silent as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;possibilities,&#8221;</span> to add, that when they demand that 4,500 roubles from your father, and he can't produce it, he'll be tried, and made to serve as a common soldier in his old age, unless you like to send me your young lady secretly. I've just had money paid me. I'll give her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret religiously.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Ah, you scoundrel!&#8217;</span>&#8212;that's what she said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You wicked scoundrel! How dare you!&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her once more that the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple creatures, Agafya and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved like perfect angels all through this business. They genuinely adored their <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Katya,&#8217;</span> thought her far above them, and waited on her, hand and foot. But Agafya told her of our conversation. I found that out afterwards. She didn't keep it back, and of course that was all I wanted.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion. The old lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn't leave his room for two days, and didn't hand over the government <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg120"></a> money. Dr. Kravchenko declared that he really was ill. But I knew for a fact, and had known for a long time, that for the last four years the money had never been in his hands except when the Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lend it to a trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to go to the fair, do a profitable business with the money, and return the whole sum to the colonel, bringing with it a present from the fair, as well as interest on the loan. But this time (I heard all about it quite by chance from Trifonov's son and heir, a driveling youth and one of the most vicious in the world)&#8212;this time, I say, Trifonov brought nothing back from the fair. The lieutenant-colonel flew to him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I've never received any money from you, and couldn't possibly have received any.&#8217;</span> That was all the answer he got. So now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel round his head, while they're all three busy putting ice on it. All at once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order to <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;hand over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.&#8217;</span> He signed the book (I saw the signature in the book afterwards), stood up, saying he would put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom, loaded his double-barreled gun with a service bullet, took the boot off his right foot, fixed the gun against his chest, and began feeling for the trigger with his foot. But Agafya, remembering what I had told her, had her suspicions. She stole up and peeped into the room just in time. She rushed in, flung herself upon him from behind, threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit the ceiling, but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and held him by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home, it was getting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had dressed, brushed my hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up my cap, when suddenly the door opened, and facing me in the room stood Katerina Ivanovna.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen her in the street, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged with two decrepit old ladies, who looked after me. They were most obliging old things, ready to do anything for me, and at my request were as silent afterwards as two cast-iron posts. Of course I grasped the position at once. She walked in and looked straight at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg121"></a> me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on her lips and round her mouth I saw uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;My sister told me,&#8217;</span> she began, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;that you would give me 4,500 roubles if I came to you for it&#8212;myself. I have come ... give me the money!&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She couldn't keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her voice failed her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it quivered. Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha in agitation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened I shan't spare myself. My first idea was a&#8212;Karamazov one. Once I was bitten by a centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with fever from it. Well, I felt a centipede biting at my heart then&#8212;a noxious insect, you understand? I looked her up and down. You've seen her? She's a beauty. But she was beautiful in another way then. At that moment she was beautiful because she was noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of her generosity and sacrifice for her father, and I&#8212;a bug! And, scoundrel as I was, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She was hemmed in. I tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous thought, so possessed my heart that it almost swooned with suspense. It seemed as if there could be no resisting it; as though I should act like a bug, like a venomous spider, without a spark of pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, I should have gone next day to ask for her hand, so that it might end honorably, so to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For though I'm a man of base desires, I'm honest. And at that very second some voice seemed to whisper in my ear, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;But when you come to-morrow to make your proposal, that girl won't even see you; she'll order her coachman to kick you out of the yard. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Publish it through all the town,&#8221;</span> she would say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm not afraid of you.&#8221;</span>&#8201;&#8217;</span> I looked at the young lady, my voice had not deceived me. That is how it would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from her face now that I should be turned out of the house. My spite was roused. I longed to play her the nastiest swinish cad's trick: to look at her with a sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her with a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg122"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You've been counting your chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred, if you like, with all my heart. But four thousand is not a sum to throw away on such frivolity. You've put yourself out to no purpose.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I should have lost the game, of course. She'd have run away. But it would have been an infernal revenge. It would have been worth it all. I'd have howled with regret all the rest of my life, only to have played that trick. Would you believe it, it has never happened to me with any other woman, not one, to look at her at such a moment with hatred. But, on my oath, I looked at her for three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful hatred&#8212;that hate which is only a hair's-breadth from love, from the maddest love!</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane, and I remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep her long, don't be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table, opened the drawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles (it was lying in a French dictionary). Then I showed it her in silence, folded it, handed it to her, opened the door into the passage, and, stepping back, made her a deep bow, a most respectful, a most impressive bow, believe me! She shuddered all over, gazed at me for a second, turned horribly pale&#8212;white as a sheet, in fact&#8212;and all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently, bowed down to my feet&#8212;not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow, with her forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot; why, I don't know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand that one might kill oneself from delight? But I didn't stab myself. I only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard&#8212;which there was no need to have told you, by the way. And I fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into the human heart! Well, so much for that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;adventure&#8217;</span> with Katerina Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you&#8212;no one else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg123"></a> in the same place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to turn quite round to face him.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00022"><span class="c9">Chapter V. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&#8212;"Heels Up"</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I understand the first half.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You understand the first half. That half is a drama, and it was played out there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is being acted here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I understand nothing of that second half so far,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I? Do you suppose I understand it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stop, Dmitri. There's one important question. Tell me, you were betrothed, you are betrothed still?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We weren't betrothed at once, not for three months after that adventure. The next day I told myself that the incident was closed, concluded, that there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish to make her an offer. On her side she gave no sign of life for the six weeks that she remained in the town; except, indeed, for one action. The day after her visit the maid-servant slipped round with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it open: it contained the change out of the banknote. Only four thousand five hundred roubles was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred on changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I don't remember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation. I searched the packet for a pencil mark&#8212;n-nothing! Well, I spent the rest of the money on such an orgy that the new major was obliged to reprimand me.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to the astonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the money untouched. He'd no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to his bed, and, three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he died five days afterwards. He was buried with military honors, for he had not had time to receive his discharge. Ten days after his funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with her aunt and sister, went to Moscow. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg124"></a> And, behold, on the very day they went away (I hadn't seen them, didn't see them off or take leave) I received a tiny note, a sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line in pencil: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I will write to you. Wait. K.&#8217;</span> And that was all.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes changed with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness of an Arabian fairy-tale. That general's widow, their nearest relation, suddenly lost the two nieces who were her heiresses and next-of-kin&#8212;both died in the same week of small-pox. The old lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed Katya as a daughter, as her one hope, clutched at her, altered her will in Katya's favor. But that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, for present use, eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what she liked with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her in Moscow, later.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred roubles. I was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three days later came the promised letter. I have it with me now. You must read it. She offers to be my wife, offers herself to me. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I love you madly,&#8217;</span> she says, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;even if you don't love me, never mind. Be my husband. Don't be afraid. I won't hamper you in any way. I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under your feet. I want to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.&#8217;</span> Alyosha, I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure myself of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don't mind&#8212;that I don't mind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it was impossible for me to go to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears. One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever. I referred to her being rich and having a dowry while I was only a stuck-up beggar! I mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence, but it slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him all I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her. Why do you look like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes, Ivan fell in love with her; he's in love with her still. I know that. I did a stupid thing, in the world's opinion; but perhaps that one stupid thing may be the saving of us all now. Oo! Don't you see what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she respects him? When she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg125"></a> compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like me, especially after all that has happened here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not a man like him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She loves her own <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">virtue</span></em>, not me.&#8221;</span> The words broke involuntarily, and almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a minute later his eyes gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the table violently with his fist.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I swear, Alyosha,&#8221;</span> he cried, with intense and genuine anger at himself; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ is God, I swear that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just now, I know that I am a million times baser in soul than she, and that these lofty sentiments of hers are as sincere as a heavenly angel's. That's the tragedy of it&#8212;that I know that for certain. What if any one does show off a bit? Don't I do it myself? And yet I'm sincere, I'm sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand how he must be cursing nature now&#8212;with his intellect, too! To see the preference given&#8212;to whom, to what? To a monster who, though he is betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can't restrain his debaucheries&#8212;and before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man like me is preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a girl wants to sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It's ridiculous! I've never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me. But destiny will be accomplished, and the best man will hold his ground while the undeserving one will vanish into his back-alley for ever&#8212;his filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, where he is at home and where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free will and with enjoyment. I've been talking foolishly. I've no words left. I use them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the back-alley, and she will marry Ivan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stop, Dmitri,&#8221;</span> Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's one thing you haven't made clear yet: you are still betrothed all the same, aren't you? How can you break off the engagement if she, your betrothed, doesn't want to?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my arrival in Moscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine style. The general's wife blessed us, and&#8212;would you believe it?&#8212;congratulated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg126"></a> Katya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You've made a good choice,&#8217;</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I see right through him.&#8217;</span> And&#8212;would you believe it?&#8212;she didn't like Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot of talk with Katya in Moscow. I told her about myself&#8212;sincerely, honorably. She listened to everything.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">Though there were proud words, too. She wrung out of me a mighty promise to reform. I gave my promise, and here&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, I called to you and brought you out here to-day, this very day&#8212;remember it&#8212;to send you&#8212;this very day again&#8212;to Katerina Ivanovna, and&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He sends you his compliments.&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But is that possible?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's just the reason I'm sending you, in my place, because it's impossible. And, how could I tell her myself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And where are you going?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To the back-alley.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To Grushenka, then!&#8221;</span> Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping his hands. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought that you had just visited her, and that was all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible and with such a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world? Confound it, I have some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka, I ceased to be betrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand that. Why do you look at me? You see, I went in the first place to beat her. I had heard, and I know for a fact now, that that captain, father's agent, had given Grushenka an I.O.U. of mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put an end to me. They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a glimpse of her before. She doesn't strike one at first sight. I knew about her old merchant, who's lying ill now, paralyzed; but he's leaving her a decent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money, that she hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg127"></a> she's a merciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I stayed. The storm broke&#8212;it struck me down like the plague. I'm plague-stricken still, and I know that everything is over, that there will never be anything more for me. The cycle of the ages is accomplished. That's my position. And though I'm a beggar, as fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in my pocket. I drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from here. I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there drunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands flying. In three days' time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you suppose the hero had gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I tell you that rogue, Grushenka, has a supple curve all over her body. You can see it in her little foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and kissed it, but that was all, I swear! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll marry you if you like,&#8217;</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;you're a beggar, you know. Say that you won't beat me, and will let me do anything I choose, and perhaps I will marry you.&#8217;</span> She laughed, and she's laughing still!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Dmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as though he were drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And do you really mean to marry her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At once, if she will. And if she won't, I shall stay all the same. I'll be the porter at her gate. Alyosha!&#8221;</span> he cried. He stopped short before him, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking him violently. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know, you innocent boy, that this is all delirium, senseless delirium, for there's a tragedy here. Let me tell you, Alexey, that I may be a low man, with low and degraded passions, but a thief and a pickpocket Dmitri Karamazov never can be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief and a pickpocket. That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka, Katerina Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I don't know, I suppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of the province and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna in Moscow, so that nothing should be known of it in the town here. So I had that three thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to see Grushenka, and it was that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards I pretended I had been to the town, but did not show her the post office receipt. I said I had sent the money and would bring the receipt, and so far I haven't brought it. I've forgotten it. Now <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg128"></a> what do you think you're going to her to-day to say? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He sends his compliments,&#8217;</span> and she'll ask you, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What about the money?&#8217;</span> You might still have said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He's a degraded sensualist, and a low creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn't send your money then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn't control himself.&#8217;</span> But still you might have added, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He isn't a thief though. Here is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to Agafya Ivanovna. But he told me to say <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;he sends his compliments.&#8221;</span>&#8201;&#8217;</span> But, as it is, she will ask, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;But where is the money?&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think. Don't worry yourself to death with despair.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What, do you suppose I'd shoot myself because I can't get three thousand to pay back? That's just it. I shan't shoot myself. I haven't the strength now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I'm going to Grushenka. I don't care what happens.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And what then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers come, I'll go into the next room. I'll clean her friends' goloshes, blow up their samovar, run their errands.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all,&#8221;</span> Alyosha said solemnly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She'll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She has a lofty mind, and no one could be more unhappy than you. She'll see that for herself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She won't forgive everything,&#8221;</span> said Dmitri, with a grin. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do you know what would be the best thing to do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Pay back the three thousand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will give you another thousand&#8212;that makes three. Take it and pay it back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And when would you get it, your three thousand? You're not of age, besides, and you must&#8212;you absolutely must&#8212;take my farewell to her to-day, with the money or without it, for I can't drag on any longer, things have come to such a pass. To-morrow is too late. I shall send you to father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To father?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg129"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But, Mitya, he won't give it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As though he would! I know he won't. Do you know the meaning of despair, Alexey?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen. Legally he owes me nothing. I've had it all from him, I know that. But morally he owes me something, doesn't he? You know he started with twenty-eight thousand of my mother's money and made a hundred thousand with it. Let him give me back only three out of the twenty-eight thousand, and he'll draw my soul out of hell, and it will atone for many of his sins. For that three thousand&#8212;I give you my solemn word&#8212;I'll make an end of everything, and he shall hear nothing more of me. For the last time I give him the chance to be a father. Tell him God Himself sends him this chance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mitya, he won't give it for anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know he won't. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially. That's not all. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago, perhaps only yesterday he found out for the first time <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">in earnest</span></em> (underline <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">in earnest</span></em>) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking, and really means to marry me. He knows her nature; he knows the cat. And do you suppose he's going to give me money to help to bring that about when he's crazy about her himself? And that's not all, either. I can tell you more than that. I know that for the last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of the bank, changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large envelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape. You see how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;To my angel, Grushenka, when she will come to me.&#8217;</span> He scrawled it himself in silence and in secret, and no one knows that the money's there except the valet, Smerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now he has been expecting Grushenka for the last three or four days; he hopes she'll come for the money. He has sent her word of it, and she has sent him word that perhaps she'll come. And if she does go to the old man, can I marry her after that? You understand now why I'm here in secret and what I'm on the watch for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here. Foma comes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg130"></a> does jobs for them. He's watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting in the day-time; and that's how he lives. I've established myself in his room. Neither he nor the women of the house know the secret&#8212;that is, that I am on the watch here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No one but Smerdyakov knows, then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was he told you about the money, then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. It's a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn't know about the money, or anything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on a two or three days' journey. A purchaser has turned up for the copse: he'll give eight thousand for the timber. So the old man keeps asking Ivan to help him by going to arrange it. It will take him two or three days. That's what the old man wants, so that Grushenka can come while he's away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then he's expecting Grushenka to-day?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, she won't come to-day; there are signs. She's certain not to come,&#8221;</span> cried Mitya suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Smerdyakov thinks so, too. Father's drinking now. He's sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him, Alyosha, and ask for the three thousand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mitya, dear, what's the matter with you?&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha, jumping up from his place, and looking keenly at his brother's frenzied face. For one moment the thought struck him that Dmitri was mad.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it? I'm not insane,&#8221;</span> said Dmitri, looking intently and earnestly at him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No fear. I am sending you to father, and I know what I'm saying. I believe in miracles.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In miracles?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He sees my despair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won't let something awful happen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. I know it will take some time. You can't go at him point blank. He's drunk now. I'll wait three hours&#8212;four, five, six, seven. Only remember you must go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day, if it has to be at midnight, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">with the money or without the money</span></em>, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He sends his compliments to you.&#8217;</span> I want you to say that verse to her: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He sends his compliments to you.&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg131"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mitya! And what if Grushenka comes to-day&#8212;if not to-day, to-morrow, or the next day?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Grushenka? I shall see her. I shall rush out and prevent it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And if&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If there's an if, it will be murder. I couldn't endure it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who will be murdered?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The old man. I shan't kill her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother, what are you saying?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, I don't know.... I don't know. Perhaps I shan't kill, and perhaps I shall. I'm afraid that he will suddenly become so loathsome to me with his face at that moment. I hate his ugly throat, his nose, his eyes, his shameless snigger. I feel a physical repulsion. That's what I'm afraid of. That's what may be too much for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll go, Mitya. I believe that God will order things for the best, that nothing awful may happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesn't come to pass&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p c3">He did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was a dining-room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the drawing-room, which was the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned ostentation. The furniture was white and very old, upholstered in old, red, silky material. In the spaces between the windows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames, of old-fashioned carving. On the walls, covered with white paper, which was torn in many places, there hung two large portraits&#8212;one of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead. In the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which a lamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional purposes as to light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg132"></a> bed very late, at three or four o'clock in the morning, and would wander about the room at night or sit in an arm-chair, thinking. This had become a habit with him. He often slept quite alone in the house, sending his servants to the lodge; but usually Smerdyakov remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves had been served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after dinner. Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The servants, Grigory and Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the gentlemen and the servants seemed in singularly good spirits. Fyodor Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter. Before he entered the room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he knew so well, and could tell from the sound of it that his father had only reached the good-humored stage, and was far from being completely drunk.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here he is! Here he is!&#8221;</span> yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted at seeing Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten dish, but it's hot and good. I don't offer you brandy, you're keeping the fast. But would you like some? No; I'd better give you some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov, go to the cupboard, the second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Look sharp!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha began refusing the liqueur.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Never mind. If you won't have it, we will,&#8221;</span> said Fyodor Pavlovitch, beaming. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But stay&#8212;have you dined?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece of bread and drunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior's kitchen. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Though I should be pleased to have some hot coffee.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Bravo, my darling! He'll have some coffee. Does it want warming? No, it's boiling. It's capital coffee: Smerdyakov's making. My Smerdyakov's an artist at coffee and at fish patties, and at fish soup, too. You must come one day and have some fish soup. Let me know beforehand.... But, stay; didn't I tell you this morning to come home with your mattress and pillow and all? Have you brought your mattress? He he he!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I haven't,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, smiling, too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning, weren't you? There, my darling, I couldn't do anything to vex you. Do you know, Ivan, I can't resist the way he looks one straight in the face and laughs? It makes me laugh all over. I'm so fond <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg133"></a> of him. Alyosha, let me give you my blessing&#8212;a father's blessing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, no,&#8221;</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll just make the sign of the cross over you, for now. Sit still. Now we've a treat for you, in your own line, too. It'll make you laugh. Balaam's ass has begun talking to us here&#8212;and how he talks! How he talks!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Balaam's ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a young man of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and taciturn. Not that he was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he was conceited and seemed to despise everybody.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was brought up by Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;with no sense of gratitude,&#8221;</span> as Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly boy, and seemed to look at the world mistrustfully. In his childhood he was very fond of hanging cats, and burying them with great ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet as though it were a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead cat as though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with the greatest secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and gave him a sound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there for a week. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He doesn't care for you or me, the monster,&#8221;</span> Grigory used to say to Marfa, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and he doesn't care for any one. Are you a human being?&#8221;</span> he said, addressing the boy directly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're not a human being. You grew from the mildew in the bath-house.<a href="the-brothers-karamazov-60.html#note_2" id="noteref_2" class="dlinternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c24">2</span></span></a> That's what you are.&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov, it appeared afterwards, could never forgive him those words. Grigory taught him to read and write, and when he was twelve years old, began teaching him the Scriptures. But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or third lesson the boy suddenly grinned.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's that for?&#8221;</span> asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly from under his spectacles.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun, moon, and stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from on the first day?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his teacher. There was something positively condescending in his expression. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg134"></a> Grigory could not restrain himself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll show you where!&#8221;</span> he cried, and gave the boy a violent slap on the cheek. The boy took the slap without a word, but withdrew into his corner again for some days. A week later he had his first attack of the disease to which he was subject all the rest of his life&#8212;epilepsy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy seemed changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though he never scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met him. Sometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the boy something sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his illness, he showed an active interest in him, sent for a doctor, and tried remedies, but the disease turned out to be incurable. The fits occurred, on an average, once a month, but at various intervals. The fits varied too, in violence: some were light and some were very severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory to use corporal punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to come upstairs to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a time, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch noticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles through the glass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books&#8212;over a hundred&#8212;but no one ever saw him reading. He at once gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, read. You shall be my librarian. You'll be better sitting reading than hanging about the courtyard. Come, read this,&#8221;</span> and Fyodor Pavlovitch gave him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He read a little but didn't like it. He did not once smile, and ended by frowning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why? Isn't it funny?&#8221;</span> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Smerdyakov did not speak.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Answer, stupid!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's all untrue,&#8221;</span> mumbled the boy, with a grin.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay, here's Smaragdov's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Universal History</span></span>. That's all true. Read that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov. He thought it dull. So the bookcase was closed again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Shortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch that Smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary fastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg135"></a> spoon and look into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a spoonful and hold it to the light.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it? A beetle?&#8221;</span> Grigory would ask.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A fly, perhaps,&#8221;</span> observed Marfa.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with his bread, his meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece on his fork to the light, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after long deliberation decide to put it in his mouth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ach! What fine gentlemen's airs!&#8221;</span> Grigory muttered, looking at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov he determined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow to be trained. He spent some years there and came back remarkably changed in appearance. He looked extraordinarily old for his age. His face had grown wrinkled, yellow, and strangely emasculate. In character he seemed almost exactly the same as before he went away. He was just as unsociable, and showed not the slightest inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we heard afterwards, he had always been silent. Moscow itself had little interest for him; he saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice of anything. He went once to the theater, but returned silent and displeased with it. On the other hand, he came back to us from Moscow well dressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed his clothes most scrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very fond of cleaning his smart calf boots with a special English polish, so that they shone like mirrors. He turned out a first-rate cook. Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a salary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such things. But he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as for men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them. Fyodor Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were becoming more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which did not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why are your fits getting worse?&#8221;</span> asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, looking askance at his new cook. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Would you like to get married? Shall I find you a wife?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg136"></a> thing was that he had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened once, when Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in the muddy courtyard three hundred-rouble notes which he had only just received. He only missed them next day, and was just hastening to search his pockets when he saw the notes lying on the table. Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked them up and brought them in the day before.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, my lad, I've never met any one like you,&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch said shortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he not only believed in his honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking for him, although the young man looked as morosely at him as at every one and was always silent. He rarely spoke. If it had occurred to any one to wonder at the time what the young man was interested in, and what was in his mind, it would have been impossible to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stop suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would stand still for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist studying his face would have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection, but only a sort of contemplation. There is a remarkable picture by the painter Kramskoy, called <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Contemplation.&#8221;</span> There is a forest in winter, and on a roadway through the forest, in absolute solitude, stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands, as it were, lost in thought. Yet he is not thinking; he is <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;contemplating.&#8221;</span> If any one touched him he would start and look at one as though awakening and bewildered. It's true he would come to himself immediately; but if he were asked what he had been thinking about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hidden within himself, the impression which had dominated him during the period of contemplation. Those impressions are dear to him and no doubt he hoards them imperceptibly, and even unconsciously. How and why, of course, he does not know either. He may suddenly, after hoarding impressions for many years, abandon everything and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his soul's salvation, or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native village, and perhaps do both. There are a good many <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;contemplatives&#8221;</span> among the peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he probably was greedily hoarding up his impressions, hardly knowing why.</p>
