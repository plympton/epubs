<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview with the elder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately after late mass. Our visitors did not take part in the service, but arrived just as it was over. First an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses, drove up with Mi&#252;sov and a distant relative of his, a young man of twenty, called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This young man was preparing to enter the university. Mi&#252;sov, with whom he was staying for the time, was trying to persuade him to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The young man was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He was nice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange fixity in his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he would sometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was silent and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with any one, he became talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything or nothing. But his animation vanished as quickly as it appeared. He was always well and even elaborately dressed; he had already some independent fortune and expectations of much more. He was a friend of Alyosha's.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of old pinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Mi&#252;sov's carriage, came Fyodor Pavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though he had been informed of the time the evening before. The visitors left their carriage at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of the monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had ever seen the monastery, and Mi&#252;sov had probably not even been to church for thirty years. He looked <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg032"></a> about him with curiosity, together with assumed ease. But, except the church and the domestic buildings, though these too were ordinary enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of the monastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the church, bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler people were a few of higher rank&#8212;two or three ladies and a very old general. They were all staying at the hotel. Our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars, but none of them gave them anything, except young Kalganov, who took a ten-copeck piece out of his purse, and, nervous and embarrassed&#8212;God knows why!&#8212;hurriedly gave it to an old woman, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Divide it equally.&#8221;</span> None of his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no reason to be embarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more overcome.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that they were not received with special honor, though one of them had recently made a donation of a thousand roubles, while another was a very wealthy and highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in the monastery were in a sense dependent, as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put their fishing rights in his hands. Yet no official personage met them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mi&#252;sov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the church, and was on the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a pretty penny for the right of lying in this <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;holy place,&#8221;</span> but refrained. His liberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must find out, for time is passing,&#8221;</span> he observed suddenly, as though speaking to himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">All at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiating little eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting his hat, he introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a landowner of Tula. He at once entered into our visitors' difficulty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces from the monastery, the other side of the copse.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know it's the other side of the copse,&#8221;</span> observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but we don't remember the way. It is a long time since we've been here.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg033"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the copse. Come with me, won't you? I'll show you. I have to go.... I am going myself. This way, this way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov, a man of sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare at them all, with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity. His eyes looked starting out of his head.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,&#8221;</span> observed Mi&#252;sov severely. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That personage has granted us an audience, so to speak, and so, though we thank you for showing us the way, we cannot ask you to accompany us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've been there. I've been already; <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">un chevalier parfait</span></span>,&#8221;</span> and Maximov snapped his fingers in the air.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who is a <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">chevalier</span></span>?&#8221;</span> asked Mi&#252;sov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory of the monastery, Zossima. Such an elder!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking monk of medium height, wearing a monk's cap, who overtook them. Fyodor Pavlovitch and Mi&#252;sov stopped.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him after your visit to the hermitage. At one o'clock, not later. And you also,&#8221;</span> he added, addressing Maximov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That I certainly will, without fail,&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, hugely delighted at the invitation. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And, believe me, we've all given our word to behave properly here.... And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the customs here? The only obstacle to me is your company....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It would be a capital thing if he didn't turn up. Do you suppose I like all this business, and in your company, too? So we will come to dinner. Thank the Father Superior,&#8221;</span> he said to the monk.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,&#8221;</span> answered the monk.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If so I'll go straight to the Father Superior&#8212;to the Father Superior,&#8221;</span> babbled Maximov.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg034"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please&#8212;&#8221;</span> the monk hesitated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Impertinent old man!&#8221;</span> Mi&#252;sov observed aloud, while Maximov ran back to the monastery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's like von Sohn,&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von Sohn? Have you ever seen von Sohn?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've seen his portrait. It's not the features, but something indefinable. He's a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the physiognomy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to behave properly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you begin to play the fool I don't intend to be associated with you here.... You see what a man he is&#8221;</span>&#8212;he turned to the monk&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm afraid to go among decent people with him.&#8221;</span> A fine smile, not without a certain slyness, came on to the pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he made no reply, and was evidently silent from a sense of his own dignity. Mi&#252;sov frowned more than ever.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through centuries, and nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,&#8221;</span> flashed through Mi&#252;sov's mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here's the hermitage. We've arrived,&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The gates are shut.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted above and on the sides of the gates.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this hermitage there are twenty-five saints being saved. They look at one another, and eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate. That's what is remarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that the elder receives ladies,&#8221;</span> he remarked suddenly to the monk.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there waiting. But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining the portico, but outside the precincts&#8212;you can see the windows&#8212;and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough. They are always outside the precincts. There is a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov, waiting there now with her sick <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg035"></a> daughter. Probably he has promised to come out to her, though of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown himself even to the people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage to the ladies. Don't suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm. But do you know that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed, but no creature of the female sex&#8212;no hens, nor turkey-hens, nor cows.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you here. They'll turn you out when I'm gone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I'm not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,&#8221;</span> he cried suddenly, stepping within the precincts, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;what a vale of roses they live in!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Though there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and beautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them, and evidently tended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds round the church, and between the tombs; and the one-storied wooden house where the elder lived was also surrounded with flowers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy? He didn't care for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and thrash even ladies with a stick,&#8221;</span> observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he went up the steps.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a great deal that's told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,&#8221;</span> answered the monk. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I will announce you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you hear? Behave properly or I will pay you out!&#8221;</span> Mi&#252;sov had time to mutter again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I can't think why you are so agitated,&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch observed sarcastically. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you uneasy about your sins? They say he can tell by one's eyes what one has come about. And what a lot you think of their opinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I'm surprised at you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Mi&#252;sov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were asked to come in. He walked in, somewhat irritated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and begin to quarrel&#8212;and lower myself and my ideas,&#8221;</span> he reflected.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00010"><span class="c9">Chapter II. The Old Buffoon</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came in from his bedroom. There were already in the cell, awaiting the elder, two monks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian, and the other Father Pa&#239;ssy, a very learned man, so they said, in delicate health, though not old. There was also a tall young man, who looked about two and twenty, standing in the corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, fresh face, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary dress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of the monastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting, reverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so not on an equality with the guests, he did not greet them with a bow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground with their fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony was performed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But Mi&#252;sov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness. He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought&#8212;he had reflected upon it the evening before&#8212;from simple politeness, since it was the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder's blessing, even if he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignified gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Mi&#252;sov like an ape. Ivan bowed with great dignity and courtesy, but he too kept his hands at his sides, while Kalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all. The elder let fall the hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again, asked them all to sit down. The blood rushed to Alyosha's cheeks. He was ashamed. His forebodings were coming true.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg037"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa, covered with leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along the opposite wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black leather. The monks sat, one at the door and the other at the window. The divinity student, the novice, and Alyosha remained standing. The cell was not very large and had a faded look. It contained nothing but the most necessary furniture, of coarse and poor quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window, and a number of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon of the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures in shining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china eggs, a Catholic cross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it, and several foreign engravings from the great Italian artists of past centuries. Next to these costly and artistic engravings were several of the roughest Russian prints of saints and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all the fairs. On the other walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past and present.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mi&#252;sov took a cursory glance at all these <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;conventional&#8221;</span> surroundings and bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high opinion of his own insight, a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty, an age at which a clever man of the world of established position can hardly help taking himself rather seriously. At the first moment he did not like Zossima. There was, indeed, something in the elder's face which many people besides Mi&#252;sov might not have liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with very weak legs, and though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten years older. His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles, particularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored, quick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling of gray hair about his temples. His pointed beard was small and scanty, and his lips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as two threads. His nose was not long, but sharp, like a bird's beak.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,&#8221;</span> thought Mi&#252;sov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served to begin the conversation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Precisely to our time,&#8221;</span> cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but no sign of my son, Dmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!&#8221;</span> (Alyosha <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg038"></a> shuddered all over at <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;sacred elder.&#8221;</span>) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am always punctual myself, minute for minute, remembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you are not a king, anyway,&#8221;</span> Mi&#252;sov muttered, losing his self-restraint at once.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes; that's true. I'm not a king, and, would you believe it, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I always say the wrong thing. Your reverence,&#8221;</span> he cried, with sudden pathos, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;you behold before you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce myself as such. It's an old habit, alas! And if I sometimes talk nonsense out of place it's with an object, with the object of amusing people and making myself agreeable. One must be agreeable, mustn't one? I was seven years ago in a little town where I had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. We went to the captain of police because we had to see him about something, and to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair, sulky man, the most dangerous type in such cases. It's their liver. I went straight up to him, and with the ease of a man of the world, you know, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Mr. Ispravnik,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;be our Napravnik.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What do you mean by Napravnik?&#8217;</span> said he. I saw, at the first half-second, that it had missed fire. He stood there so glum. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I wanted to make a joke,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;for the general diversion, as Mr. Napravnik is our well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we need for the harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.&#8217;</span> And I explained my comparison very reasonably, didn't I? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Excuse me,&#8217;</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on my calling.&#8217;</span> He turned and walked away. I followed him, shouting, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes, yes, you are an Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;No,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;since you called me a Napravnik I am one.&#8217;</span> And would you believe it, it ruined our business! And I'm always like that, always like that. Always injuring myself with my politeness. Once, many years ago, I said to an influential person: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Your wife is a ticklish lady,&#8217;</span> in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities, so to speak. But he asked me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why, have you tickled her?&#8217;</span> I thought I'd be polite, so I couldn't help saying, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes,&#8217;</span> and he gave me a fine tickling on the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I'm not ashamed to tell the story. I'm always injuring myself like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're doing it now,&#8221;</span> muttered Mi&#252;sov, with disgust.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg039"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as soon as I began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that you'd be the first to remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn't coming off, your reverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the lower jaw and there is almost a spasm in them. That's been so since I was young, when I had to make jokes for my living in noblemen's families. I am an inveterate buffoon, and have been from birth up, your reverence, it's as though it were a craze in me. I dare say it's a devil within me. But only a little one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But not your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you're not a lodging worth having either. But I do believe&#8212;I believe in God, though I have had doubts of late. But now I sit and await words of wisdom. I'm like the philosopher, Diderot, your reverence. Did you ever hear, most Holy Father, how Diderot went to see the Metropolitan Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine? He went in and said straight out, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;There is no God.&#8217;</span> To which the great bishop lifted up his finger and answered, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.&#8217;</span> And he fell down at his feet on the spot. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I believe,&#8217;</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and will be christened.&#8217;</span> And so he was. Princess Dashkov was his godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you're telling lies and that that stupid anecdote isn't true. Why are you playing the fool?&#8221;</span> cried Mi&#252;sov in a shaking voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I suspected all my life that it wasn't true,&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch cried with conviction. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I'll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen. Great elder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot's christening I made up just now. I never thought of it before. I made it up to add piquancy. I play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable. Though I really don't know myself, sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot, I heard as far as <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the fool hath said in his heart&#8217;</span> twenty times from the gentry about here when I was young. I heard your aunt, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, tell the story. They all believe to this day that the infidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan Platon....&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg040"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mi&#252;sov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was furious, and conscious of being ridiculous.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty or fifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had entered that cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration. Almost every one admitted to the cell felt that a great favor was being shown him. Many remained kneeling during the whole visit. Of those visitors, many had been men of high rank and learning, some even freethinkers, attracted by curiosity, but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverence and delicacy, for here there was no question of money, but only, on the one side love and kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to decide some spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazed and bewildered the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, with unchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear what the elder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up, like Mi&#252;sov. Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears. What seemed to him strangest of all was that his brother Ivan, on whom alone he had rested his hopes, and who alone had such influence on his father that he could have stopped him, sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes, apparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he had nothing to do with it. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the divinity student, whom he knew almost intimately. He alone in the monastery knew Rakitin's thoughts.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221;</span> began Mi&#252;sov, addressing Father Zossima, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for perhaps I seem to be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made a mistake in believing that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would understand what was due on a visit to so honored a personage. I did not suppose I should have to apologize simply for having come with him....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Pyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave the room, overwhelmed with confusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't distress yourself, I beg.&#8221;</span> The elder got on to his feeble legs, and taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit down again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I beg you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg you to be my guest.&#8221;</span> And with a bow he went back and sat down again on his little sofa.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg041"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?&#8221;</span> Fyodor Pavlovitch cried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both hands, as though ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be uneasy,&#8221;</span> the elder said impressively. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do not trouble. Make yourself quite at home. And, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root of it all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too much, but I accept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed Father, you'd better not invite me to be my natural self. Don't risk it.... I will not go so far as that myself. I warn you for your own sake. Well, the rest is still plunged in the mists of uncertainty, though there are people who'd be pleased to describe me for you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for you, holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Blessed be the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck&#8212;the paps especially. When you said just now, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Don't be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root of it all,&#8217;</span> you pierced right through me by that remark, and read me to the core. Indeed, I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon. So I say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Let me really play the buffoon. I am not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one of you worse than I am.&#8217;</span> That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame, great elder, from shame; it's simply over-sensitiveness that makes me rowdy. If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as the kindest and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have been then! Teacher!&#8221;</span> he fell suddenly on his knees, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;what must I do to gain eternal life?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really moved.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a smile:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You have known for a long time what you must do. You have sense enough: don't give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech; don't give way to sensual lust; and, above all, to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg042"></a> love of money. And close your taverns. If you can't close all, at least two or three. And, above all&#8212;don't lie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You mean about Diderot?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, not about Diderot. Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love, and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all from continual lying to other men and to himself. The man who lies to himself can be more easily offended than any one. You know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense, isn't it? A man may know that nobody has insulted him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made a mountain out of a molehill&#8212;he knows that himself, yet he will be the first to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he feels great pleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness. But get up, sit down, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elder's thin hand. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said that so well, as I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life taking offense, to please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds, for it is not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted&#8212;that you had forgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I shall make a note of that. But I have been lying, lying positively my whole life long, every day and hour of it. Of a truth, I am a lie, and the father of lies. Though I believe I am not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say, the son of lies, and that will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may sometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a word will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I had been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and to find out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me. Here is my question: Is it true, great Father, that the story is told somewhere in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Lives of the Saints</span></span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg043"></a> of a holy saint martyred for his faith who, when his head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up his head, and, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;courteously kissing it,&#8217;</span> walked a long way, carrying it in his hands. Is that true or not, honored Father?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, it is untrue,&#8221;</span> said the elder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What saint do you say the story is told of?&#8221;</span> asked the Father Librarian.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can't tell. I was deceived. I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who told it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi&#252;sov here, who was so angry just now about Diderot. He it was who told the story.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. It was three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story you shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew nothing of it, but I went home with my faith shaken, and I have been getting more and more shaken ever since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you were the cause of a great fall. That was not a Diderot!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly clear to every one by now that he was playing a part again. Yet Mi&#252;sov was stung by his words.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,&#8221;</span> he muttered. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I may really have told it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was told it myself. I heard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me it was read at our mass from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Lives of the Saints</span></span> ... he was a very learned man who had made a special study of Russian statistics and had lived a long time in Russia.... I have not read the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Lives of the Saints</span></span> myself, and I am not going to read them ... all sorts of things are said at dinner&#8212;we were dining then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!&#8221;</span> said Fyodor Pavlovitch, mimicking him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do I care for your faith?&#8221;</span> Mi&#252;sov was on the point of shouting, but he suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You defile everything you touch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The elder suddenly rose from his seat. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Excuse me, gentlemen, for leaving you a few minutes,&#8221;</span> he said, addressing all his guests. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have visitors awaiting me who arrived before you. But don't <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg044"></a> you tell lies all the same,&#8221;</span> he added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch with a good-humored face. He went out of the cell. Alyosha and the novice flew to escort him down the steps. Alyosha was breathless: he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too, that the elder was good-humored and not offended. Father Zossima was going towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But Fyodor Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Blessed man!&#8221;</span> he cried, with feeling. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Allow me to kiss your hand once more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe me, I have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try you. I have been testing you all the time to see whether I could get on with you. Is there room for my humility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you! But now, I'll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the time. I'll sit in a chair and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You are the principal person left now&#8212;for ten minutes.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00011"><span class="c9">Chapter III. Peasant Women Who Have Faith</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the precinct, there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women. They had been told that the elder was at last coming out, and they had gathered together in anticipation. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and her daughter, had also come out into the portico to wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it set aside for women of rank.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive, and always dressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had lively black eyes. She was not more than thirty-three, and had been five years a widow. Her daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially paralyzed. The poor child had not been able to walk for the last six months, and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair. She had a charming little face, rather thin from illness, but full of gayety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark eyes with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg045"></a> their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take her abroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the summer by business connected with their estate. They had been staying a week in our town, where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion, but had visited Father Zossima once already, three days before. Though they knew that the elder scarcely saw any one, they had now suddenly turned up again, and urgently entreated <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the happiness of looking once again on the great healer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter's invalid carriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one of our monastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north. He too sought the elder's blessing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up into the portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his stole, and began blessing the women who thronged about him. One crazy woman was led up to him. As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth. Laying the stole on her forehead, he read a short prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and quieted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened to see and hear these <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;possessed&#8221;</span> women in the villages and monasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church. But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it, at once the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;possession&#8221;</span> ceased, and the sick women were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were told to confirm this. But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women. It is a disease, I was told, arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard, abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery, from beatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure like others. The strange and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg046"></a> instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been explained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;clericals,&#8221;</span> arose probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supported her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question that the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it. And so, with a nervous and psychically deranged woman, a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took place, and was bound to take place, at the moment of bowing down to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and it did come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment, others cried out in sing-song voices.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He blessed them all and talked with some of them. The <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;possessed&#8221;</span> woman he knew already. She came from a village only six versts from the monastery, and had been brought to him before.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But here is one from afar.&#8221;</span> He pointed to a woman by no means old but very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackened by exposure. She was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder; there was something almost frenzied in her eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles from here. From afar off, Father, from afar off!&#8221;</span> the woman began in a sing-song voice as though she were chanting a dirge, swaying her head from side to side with her cheek resting in her hand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among the peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a grief that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds vent in wailing. This is particularly common with women. But it is no lighter a grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire consolation. It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness. Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to reopen the wound.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg047"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are of the tradesman class?&#8221;</span> said Father Zossima, looking curiously at her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though we live in the town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard of you, Father, we heard of you. I have buried my little son, and I have come on a pilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but they told me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Go, Nastasya, go to them&#8217;</span>&#8212;that is to you. I have come; I was yesterday at the service, and to-day I have come to you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you weeping for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's my little son I'm grieving for, Father. He was three years old&#8212;three years all but three months. For my little boy, Father, I'm in anguish, for my little boy. He was the last one left. We had four, my Nikita and I, and now we've no children, our dear ones have all gone. I buried the first three without grieving overmuch, and now I have buried the last I can't forget him. He seems always standing before me. He never leaves me. He has withered my heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his little boots, and I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his little things. I look at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Let me go on a pilgrimage, master.&#8217;</span> He is a driver. We're not poor people, Father, not poor; he drives our own horse. It's all our own, the horse and the carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My Nikita has begun drinking while I am away. He's sure to. It used to be so before. As soon as I turn my back he gives way to it. But now I don't think about him. It's three months since I left home. I've forgotten him. I've forgotten everything. I don't want to remember. And what would our life be now together? I've done with him, I've done. I've done with them all. I don't care to look upon my house and my goods. I don't care to see anything at all!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, mother,&#8221;</span> said the elder. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Once in olden times a holy saint saw in the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one, her only one, whom God had taken. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Knowest thou not,&#8217;</span> said the saint to her, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;how bold these little ones are before the throne of God? Verily there are none bolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thou didst give us life, O Lord,&#8221;</span> they say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou didst take it back again.&#8221;</span> And so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them at once the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg048"></a> rank of angels. Therefore,&#8217;</span> said the saint, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;thou, too, O mother, rejoice and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the fellowship of the angels.&#8217;</span> That's what the saint said to the weeping mother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have spoken falsely. Therefore you too, mother, know that your little one is surely before the throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying to God for you, and therefore weep not, but rejoice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her hand. She sighed deeply.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Foolish one,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with the angels before God.&#8217;</span> He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I see that he cries like me. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I know, Nikita,&#8217;</span> said I. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Where could he be if not with the Lord God? Only, here with us now he is not as he used to sit beside us before.&#8217;</span> And if only I could look upon him one little time, if only I could peep at him one little time, without going up to him, without speaking, if I could be hidden in a corner and only see him for one little minute, hear him playing in the yard, calling in his little voice, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Mammy, where are you?&#8217;</span> If only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room just once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he used to run to me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his little feet I should know him! But he's gone, Father, he's gone, and I shall never hear him again. Here's his little sash, but him I shall never see or hear now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She drew out of her bosom her boy's little embroidered sash, and as soon as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her eyes with her fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It is Rachel of old,&#8221;</span> said the elder, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;weeping for her children, and will not be comforted because they are not. Such is the lot set on earth for you mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation is not what you need. Weep and be not consoled, but weep. Only every time that you weep be sure to remember that your little son is one of the angels of God, that he looks down from there at you and sees you, and rejoices at your tears, and points at them to the Lord God; and a long while yet will you keep that great mother's grief. But it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your bitter tears will be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg049"></a> only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart and delivers it from sin. And I shall pray for the peace of your child's soul. What was his name?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey, Father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, Father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your grief in my prayers, and I will pray for your husband's health. It is a sin for you to leave him. Your little one will see from heaven that you have forsaken his father, and will weep over you. Why do you trouble his happiness? He is living, for the soul lives for ever, and though he is not in the house he is near you, unseen. How can he go into the house when you say that the house is hateful to you? To whom is he to go if he find you not together, his father and mother? He comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. But then he will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother; go this very day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You've gone straight to my heart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for me,&#8221;</span> the woman began in a sing-song voice; but the elder had already turned away to a very old woman, dressed like a dweller in the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyes showed that she had come with an object, and in order to say something. She said she was the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close by in the town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had gone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but now a year had passed since he had written. She did inquire about him, but she did not know the proper place to inquire.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna&#8212;she's a rich merchant's wife&#8212;said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You go, Prohorovna, and put your son's name down for prayer in the church, and pray for the peace of his soul as though he were dead. His soul will be troubled,&#8217;</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and he will write you a letter.&#8217;</span> And Stepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been many times tried. Only I am in doubt.... Oh, you light of ours! is it true or false, and would it be right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't think of it. It's shameful to ask the question. How is it possible to pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg050"></a> mother too! It's a great sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you. Better pray to the Queen of Heaven, our swift defense and help, for his good health, and that she may forgive you for your error. And another thing I will tell you, Prohorovna. Either he will soon come back to you, your son, or he will be sure to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be in peace. Your son is alive, I tell you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for all of us and for our sins!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes fixed upon him. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young peasant woman was gazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought him, but she seemed afraid to approach.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it, my child?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Absolve my soul, Father,&#8221;</span> she articulated softly, and slowly sank on her knees and bowed down at his feet. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have sinned, Father. I am afraid of my sin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer to him, still on her knees.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am a widow these three years,&#8221;</span> she began in a half-whisper, with a sort of shudder. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I had a hard life with my husband. He was an old man. He used to beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought looking at him, if he were to get well, if he were to get up again, what then? And then the thought came to me&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay!&#8221;</span> said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible to catch anything. She had soon done.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Three years ago?&#8221;</span> asked the elder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Three years. At first I didn't think about it, but now I've begun to be ill, and the thought never leaves me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you come from far?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Over three hundred miles away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you told it in confession?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you been admitted to Communion?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don't fret. If only your penitence fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg051"></a> can be no sin on all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to the truly repentant! Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of God. Can there be a sin which could exceed the love of God? Think only of repentance, continual repentance, but dismiss fear altogether. Believe that God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your sin, in your sin. It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not. Be not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive the dead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled with him in truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more will God. Love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck a little ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth without speaking.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with a tiny baby in her arms.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From Vyshegorye, dear Father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've come to look at you. I have been to you before&#8212;or have you forgotten? You've no great memory if you've forgotten me. They told us you were ill. Thinks I, I'll go and see him for myself. Now I see you, and you're not ill! You'll live another twenty years. God bless you! There are plenty to pray for you; how should you be ill?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I thank you for all, daughter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are sixty copecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me. I thought as I came along, better give through him. He'll know whom to give to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I will do so certainly. Is that your little girl?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My little girl, Father, Lizaveta.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg052"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta! You have gladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children, farewell, dear ones.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He blessed them all and bowed low to them.</p>
