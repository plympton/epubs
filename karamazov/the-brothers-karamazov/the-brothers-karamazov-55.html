<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00099"><span class="c9">Chapter IV. Fortune Smiles On Mitya</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was not required to take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed him very gently and sympathetically. It was evident that his reputation for goodness had preceded him. Alyosha gave his evidence modestly and with restraint, but his warm sympathy for his unhappy brother was unmistakable. In answer to one question, he sketched his brother's character as that of a man, violent-tempered perhaps and carried away by his passions, but at the same time honorable, proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if necessary. He admitted, however, that, through his passion for Grushenka and his rivalry with his father, his brother had been of late in an intolerable position. But he repelled with indignation the suggestion that his brother might have committed a murder for the sake of gain, though he recognized that the three thousand roubles had become almost an obsession with Mitya; that he looked upon them as part of the inheritance he had been cheated of by his father, and that, indifferent as he was to money as a rule, he could not even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page766"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg766"></a> speak of that three thousand without fury. As for the rivalry of the two <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;ladies,&#8221;</span> as the prosecutor expressed it&#8212;that is, of Grushenka and Katya&#8212;he answered evasively and was even unwilling to answer one or two questions altogether.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill your father?&#8221;</span> asked the prosecutor. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You can refuse to answer if you think necessary,&#8221;</span> he added.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He did not tell me so directly,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How so? Did he indirectly?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear that at an extreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might perhaps murder him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you believed him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some higher feeling would always save him at the fatal moment, as it has indeed saved him, for it was not he killed my father,&#8221;</span> Alyosha said firmly, in a loud voice that was heard throughout the court.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity of your conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your affection for your unhappy brother. Your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode is known to us already from the preliminary investigation. I won't attempt to conceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all the other evidence collected by the prosecution. And so I think it essential to press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your brother's innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom you gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,&#8221;</span> replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I made no accusation against Smerdyakov of myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yet you gave evidence against him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri's words. I was told what took place at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov before I was examined. I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if he didn't commit the murder, then&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely persuaded of your brother's innocence?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page767"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg767"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn't lie to me. I saw from his face he wasn't lying.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have no other proof.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And of Smerdyakov's guilt you have no proof whatever but your brother's word and the expression of his face?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I have no other proof.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression left by Alyosha's evidence on the public was most disappointing. There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard something, some one had pointed out something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some extraordinary proofs of his brother's innocence and Smerdyakov's guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except certain moral convictions so natural in a brother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking Alyosha when it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred for his father and that he might kill him, and whether he had heard it, for instance, at their last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha started as he answered, as though only just recollecting and understanding something.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I remember one circumstance now which I'd quite forgotten myself. It wasn't clear to me at the time, but now&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he recounted eagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that evening under the tree, on the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck himself on the breast, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the upper part of the breast,&#8221;</span> and had repeated several times that he had a means of regaining his honor, that that means was here, here on his breast. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I thought, when he struck himself on the breast, he meant that it was in his heart,&#8221;</span> Alyosha continued, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that he might find in his heart strength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him and which he did not dare confess even to me. I must confess I did think at the time that he was speaking of our father, and that the disgrace he was shuddering at was the thought of going to our father and doing some violence to him. Yet it was just then that he pointed to something on his breast, so that I remember the idea struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page768"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg768"></a> breast, but below, and that he struck himself much too high, just below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. My idea seemed silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to that little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Just so,&#8221;</span> Mitya cried from his place. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's right, Alyosha, it was the little bag I struck with my fist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep quiet, and at the same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried away himself by his recollection, warmly expressed his theory that this disgrace was probably just that fifteen hundred roubles on him, which he might have returned to Katerina Ivanovna as half of what he owed her, but which he had yet determined not to repay her and to use for another purpose&#8212;namely, to enable him to elope with Grushenka, if she consented.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It is so, it must be so,&#8221;</span> exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My brother cried several times that half of the disgrace, half of it (he said <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">half</span></em> several times) he could free himself from at once, but that he was so unhappy in his weakness of will that he wouldn't do it ... that he knew beforehand he was incapable of doing it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself just on this part of the breast?&#8221;</span> Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why does he strike himself up there when the heart is lower down?&#8217;</span> and the thought seemed stupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming stupid ... it flashed through my mind. That's what brought it back to me just now. How could I have forgotten it till now? It was that little bag he meant when he said he had the means but wouldn't give back that fifteen hundred. And when he was arrested at Mokroe he cried out&#8212;I know, I was told it&#8212;that he considered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he had the means of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he owed her, he yet could not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And what torture, what torture that debt has been to him!&#8221;</span> Alyosha exclaimed in conclusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to describe once more how it had all happened, and several times insisted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page769"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg769"></a> on the question, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Had the prisoner seemed to point to anything? Perhaps he had simply struck himself with his fist on the breast?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But it was not with his fist,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;he pointed with his fingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have so completely forgotten it till this moment?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last witness's evidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been pointing to the fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast, just below the neck, and that that was, of course, the disgrace, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A disgrace I cannot deny, the most shameful act of my whole life,&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I might have repaid it and didn't repay it. I preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than give it back. And the most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand I shouldn't give it back! You are right, Alyosha! Thanks, Alyosha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So Alyosha's cross-examination ended. What was important and striking about it was that one fact at least had been found, and even though this were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence, it did go some little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had contained fifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been lying at the preliminary inquiry when he alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred roubles were <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;his own.&#8221;</span> Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he moved away to the seat assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How was it I forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come back to me now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Katerina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she entered something extraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched their lorgnettes and opera-glasses. There was a stir among the men: some stood up to get a better view. Everybody alleged afterwards that Mitya had turned <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;white as a sheet&#8221;</span> on her entrance. All in black, she advanced modestly, almost timidly. It was impossible to tell from her face that she was agitated; but there was a resolute gleam in her dark and gloomy eyes. I may remark that many people mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that moment. She spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over the court. She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appear composed. The President began his examination discreetly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page770"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg770"></a> and very respectfully, as though afraid to touch on <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;certain chords,&#8221;</span> and showing consideration for her great unhappiness. But in answer to one of the first questions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;until he left me of his own accord...&#8221;</span> she added quietly. When they asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to post to her relations, she said firmly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I didn't give him the money simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was in great need of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the understanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to. There was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in detail. I will only give the substance of her evidence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he got money from his father,&#8221;</span> she went on. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have never doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in money matters. He felt quite certain that he would receive the money from his father, and spoke to me several times about it. I knew he had a feud with his father and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father. I don't remember any threat uttered by him against his father. He certainly never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come to me at that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety about that unlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up coming to see me ... and I myself was put in such a position ... that I could not invite him.... And I had no right, indeed, to be exacting as to that money,&#8221;</span> she added suddenly, and there was a ring of resolution in her voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was once indebted to him for assistance in money for more than three thousand, and I took it, although I could not at that time foresee that I should ever be in a position to repay my debt.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your acquaintance?&#8221;</span> Fetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way, instantly scenting something favorable. I must mention in parenthesis that, though Fetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg partly at the instance of Katerina Ivanovna herself, he knew nothing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page771"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg771"></a> about the episode of the four thousand roubles given her by Mitya, and of her <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;bowing to the ground to him.&#8221;</span> She concealed this from him and said nothing about it, and that was strange. It may be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did not know till the very last minute whether she would speak of that episode in the court, and waited for the inspiration of the moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">No, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her story. She told everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told Alyosha, and her bowing to the ground, and her reason. She told about her father and her going to Mitya, and did not in one word, in a single hint, suggest that Mitya had himself, through her sister, proposed they should <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;send him Katerina Ivanovna&#8221;</span> to fetch the money. She generously concealed that and was not ashamed to make it appear as though she had of her own impulse run to the young officer, relying on something ... to beg him for the money. It was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I listened. The court was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was something unexampled. Even from such a self-willed and contemptuously proud girl as she was, such an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice, such self-immolation, seemed incredible. And for what, for whom? To save the man who had deceived and insulted her and to help, in however small a degree, in saving him, by creating a strong impression in his favor. And, indeed, the figure of the young officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocent girl, handed her his last four thousand roubles&#8212;all he had in the world&#8212;was thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but ... I had a painful misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might come of it later (and it did, in fact, it did). It was repeated all over the town afterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was perhaps not quite complete&#8212;that is, in the statement that the officer had let the young lady depart <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;with nothing but a respectful bow.&#8221;</span> It was hinted that something was here omitted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole story,&#8221;</span> the most highly respected of our ladies maintained, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;even then it's very doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl to behave in that way, even for the sake of saving her father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbid sensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page772"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg772"></a> that? She must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to tell everything. Of course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the truth of her story only arose afterwards and at the first moment all were deeply impressed by it. As for the judges and the lawyers, they listened in reverent, almost shame-faced silence to Katerina Ivanovna. The prosecutor did not venture upon even one question on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her. Oh, he was almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained. For a man to give his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the same man to murder his father for the sake of robbing him of three thousand&#8212;the idea seemed too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt that now the charge of theft, at least, was as good as disproved. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The case&#8221;</span> was thrown into quite a different light. There was a wave of sympathy for Mitya. As for him.... I was told that once or twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was giving her evidence, he jumped up from his seat, sank back again, and hid his face in his hands. But when she had finished, he suddenly cried in a sobbing voice:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Katya, why have you ruined me?&#8221;</span> and his sobs were audible all over the court. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried again:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now I am condemned!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Then he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his arms across his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and sat down in her place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast down. Those who were sitting near her declared that for a long time she shivered all over as though in a fever. Grushenka was called.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the final cause of Mitya's ruin. For I am convinced, so is every one&#8212;all the lawyers said the same afterwards&#8212;that if the episode had not occurred, the prisoner would at least have been recommended to mercy. But of that later. A few words first about Grushenka.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent black shawl on her shoulders. She walked to the witness-box with her smooth, noiseless tread, with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full figure. She looked steadily at the President, turning her eyes neither to the right nor to the left. To my thinking she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page773"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg773"></a> looked very handsome at that moment, and not at all pale, as the ladies alleged afterwards. They declared, too, that she had a concentrated and spiteful expression. I believe that she was simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and inquisitive eyes of our scandal-loving public. She was proud and could not stand contempt. She was one of those people who flare up, angry and eager to retaliate, at the mere suggestion of contempt. There was an element of timidity, too, of course, and inward shame at her own timidity, so it was not strange that her tone kept changing. At one moment it was angry, contemptuous and rough, and at another there was a sincere note of self-condemnation. Sometimes she spoke as though she were taking a desperate plunge; as though she felt, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't care what happens, I'll say it....&#8221;</span> Apropos of her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she remarked curtly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's all nonsense, and was it my fault that he would pester me?&#8221;</span> But a minute later she added, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was all my fault. I was laughing at them both&#8212;at the old man and at him, too&#8212;and I brought both of them to this. It was all on account of me it happened.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Samsonov's name came up somehow. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's nobody's business,&#8221;</span> she snapped at once, with a sort of insolent defiance. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was my benefactor; he took me when I hadn't a shoe to my foot, when my family had turned me out.&#8221;</span> The President reminded her, though very politely, that she must answer the questions directly, without going off into irrelevant details. Grushenka crimsoned and her eyes flashed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only heard from <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that wicked wretch&#8221;</span> that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an envelope with notes for three thousand in it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But that was all foolishness. I was only laughing. I wouldn't have gone to him for anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To whom are you referring as <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;that wicked wretch&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span> inquired the prosecutor.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged himself last night.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such a definite accusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds for it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page774"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg774"></a> The woman who came between us has ruined him; she is the cause of it all, let me tell you,&#8221;</span> Grushenka added. She seemed to be quivering with hatred, and there was a vindictive note in her voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She was again asked to whom she was referring.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me, offered me chocolate, tried to fascinate me. There's not much true shame about her, I can tell you that....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to moderate her language. But the jealous woman's heart was burning, and she did not care what she did.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,&#8221;</span> the prosecutor asked, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;every one saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry out: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's all my fault. We'll go to Siberia together!&#8217;</span> So you already believed him to have murdered his father?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't remember what I felt at the time,&#8221;</span> answered Grushenka. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Every one was crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt that it was my fault, that it was on my account he had murdered him. But when he said he wasn't guilty, I believed him at once, and I believe him now and always shall believe him. He is not the man to tell a lie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that among other things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five roubles <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;you paid him for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There was nothing strange about his taking the money,&#8221;</span> sneered Grushenka, with angry contempt. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was always coming to me for money: he used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he had enough to keep him without my help.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?&#8221;</span> Fetyukovitch asked, in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother's sister. But he's always besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully ashamed of me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor in the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told that Rakitin turned purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard before she came into the court that he had given evidence against Mitya, and so she was angry. The whole <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page775"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg775"></a> effect on the public, of Rakitin's speech, of his noble sentiments, of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of Russia, was this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another godsend. Grushenka's cross-examination did not last long and, of course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence. She left a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her evidence and sat down again in the court, at a good distance from Katerina Ivanovna. Mitya was silent throughout her evidence. He sat as though turned to stone, with his eyes fixed on the ground.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan was called to give evidence.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00100"><span class="c9">Chapter V. A Sudden Catastrophe</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the usher of the court announced to the President that, owing to an attack of illness or some sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the moment, but was ready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered. But no one seemed to have heard it and it only came out later.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The principal witnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been questioned. Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public was feeling almost fatigued. Several more witnesses were still to be heard, who probably had little information to give after all that had been given. Time was passing. Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness, looking at no one, and with his head bowed, as though plunged in gloomy thought. He was irreproachably dressed, but his face made a painful impression, on me at least: there was an earthy look in it, a look like a dying man's. His eyes were lusterless; he raised them and looked slowly round the court. Alyosha jumped up from his seat and moaned <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</span> I remember that, but it was hardly noticed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The President began by informing him that he was a witness not on oath, that he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page776"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg776"></a> course, he must bear witness according to his conscience, and so on, and so on. Ivan listened and looked at him blankly, but his face gradually relaxed into a smile, and as soon as the President, looking at him in astonishment, finished, he laughed outright.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, and what else?&#8221;</span> he asked in a loud voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something strange. The President showed signs of uneasiness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You ... are perhaps still unwell?&#8221;</span> he began, looking everywhere for the usher.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and can tell you something interesting,&#8221;</span> Ivan answered with sudden calmness and respectfulness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You have some special communication to make?&#8221;</span> the President went on, still mistrustfully.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head, answered, almost stammering:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No ... I haven't. I have nothing particular.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They began asking him questions. He answered, as it were, reluctantly, with extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew more and more marked, though he answered rationally. To many questions he answered that he did not know. He knew nothing of his father's money relations with Dmitri. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wasn't interested in the subject,&#8221;</span> he added. Threats to murder his father he had heard from the prisoner. Of the money in the envelope he had heard from Smerdyakov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The same thing over and over again,&#8221;</span> he interrupted suddenly, with a look of weariness. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have nothing particular to tell the court.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see you are unwell and understand your feelings,&#8221;</span> the President began.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to invite them to examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly asked in an exhausted voice:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned to walk out of the court. But after taking four steps he stood still, as though he had reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page777"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg777"></a> How does it go? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.&#8217;</span> They were trying to put on her sarafan to take her to church to be married, and she said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.&#8217;</span>... It's in some book about the peasantry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</span> the President asked severely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, this,&#8221;</span> Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here's the money ... the notes that lay in that envelope&#8221;</span> (he nodded towards the table on which lay the material evidence), <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for the sake of which our father was murdered. Where shall I put them? Mr. Superintendent, take them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the President.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could this money have come into your possession if it is the same money?&#8221;</span> the President asked wonderingly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday.... I was with him just before he hanged himself. It was he, not my brother, killed our father. He murdered him and I incited him to do it ... Who doesn't desire his father's death?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you in your right mind?&#8221;</span> broke involuntarily from the President.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty mind as all of you ... as all these ... ugly faces.&#8221;</span> He turned suddenly to the audience. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My father has been murdered and they pretend they are horrified,&#8221;</span> he snarled, with furious contempt. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They keep up the sham with one another. Liars! They all desire the death of their fathers. One reptile devours another.... If there hadn't been a murder, they'd have been angry and gone home ill-humored. It's a spectacle they want! <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span class="c19">Panem et circenses</span></span>. Though I am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink for Christ's sake!&#8221;</span> He suddenly clutched his head.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The usher at once approached him. Alyosha jumped up and cried, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is ill. Don't believe him: he has brain fever.&#8221;</span> Katerina Ivanovna rose impulsively from her seat and, rigid with horror, gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up and greedily looked at his brother and listened to him with a wild, strange smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,&#8221;</span> Ivan began again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You can't expect eloquence from a murderer,&#8221;</span> he added suddenly for some reason and laughed a queer laugh.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page778"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg778"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay. The two other judges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch pricked up his ears as he listened: the hall was hushed in expectation. The President seemed suddenly to recollect himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here. Calm yourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really have something to tell. How can you confirm your statement ... if indeed you are not delirious?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's just it. I have no proof. That cur Smerdyakov won't send you proofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You think of nothing but envelopes&#8212;one is enough. I've no witnesses ... except one, perhaps,&#8221;</span> he smiled thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who is your witness?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular! <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">Le diable n'existe point!</span></span> Don't pay attention: he is a paltry, pitiful devil,&#8221;</span> he added suddenly. He ceased laughing and spoke as it were, confidentially. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is here somewhere, no doubt&#8212;under that table with the material evidence on it, perhaps. Where should he sit if not there? You see, listen to me. I told him I don't want to keep quiet, and he talked about the geological cataclysm ... idiocy! Come, release the monster ... he's been singing a hymn. That's because his heart is light! It's like a drunken man in the street bawling how <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Vanka went to Petersburg,&#8217;</span> and I would give a quadrillion quadrillions for two seconds of joy. You don't know me! Oh, how stupid all this business is! Come, take me instead of him! I didn't come for nothing.... Why, why is everything so stupid?...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And he began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round him again. But the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha rushed towards him, but the court usher had already seized Ivan by the arm.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What are you about?&#8221;</span> he cried, staring into the man's face, and suddenly seizing him by the shoulders, he flung him violently to the floor. But the police were on the spot and he was seized. He screamed furiously. And all the time he was being removed, he yelled and screamed something incoherent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The whole court was thrown into confusion. I don't remember everything as it happened. I was excited myself and could not follow. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page779"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg779"></a> I only know that afterwards, when everything was quiet again and every one understood what had happened, the court usher came in for a reprimand, though he very reasonably explained that the witness had been quite well, that the doctor had seen him an hour ago, when he had a slight attack of giddiness, but that, until he had come into the court, he had talked quite consecutively, so that nothing could have been foreseen&#8212;that he had, in fact, insisted on giving evidence. But before every one had completely regained their composure and recovered from this scene, it was followed by another. Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics. She sobbed, shrieking loudly, but refused to leave the court, struggled, and besought them not to remove her. Suddenly she cried to the President:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here is a document, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly! It's a letter from that monster ... that man there, there!&#8221;</span> she pointed to Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It was he killed his father, you will see that directly. He wrote to me how he would kill his father! But the other one is ill, he is ill, he is delirious!&#8221;</span> she kept crying out, beside herself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The court usher took the document she held out to the President, and she, dropping into her chair, hiding her face in her hands, began convulsively and noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and stifling every sound for fear she should be ejected from the court. The document she had handed up was that letter Mitya had written at the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Metropolis&#8221;</span> tavern, which Ivan had spoken of as a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;mathematical proof.&#8221;</span> Alas! its mathematical conclusiveness was recognized, and had it not been for that letter, Mitya might have escaped his doom or, at least, that doom would have been less terrible. It was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail. What followed is still confused to my mind. The President must, I suppose, have at once passed on the document to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers on both sides. I only remember how they began examining the witness. On being gently asked by the President whether she had recovered sufficiently, Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am ready, I am ready! I am quite equal to answering you,&#8221;</span> she added, evidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented from giving evidence. She was asked to explain in detail what this letter was and under what circumstances she received it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I received it the day before the crime was committed, but he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page780"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg780"></a> wrote it the day before that, at the tavern&#8212;that is, two days before he committed the crime. Look, it is written on some sort of bill!&#8221;</span> she cried breathlessly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He hated me at that time, because he had behaved contemptibly and was running after that creature ... and because he owed me that three thousand.... Oh! he was humiliated by that three thousand on account of his own meanness! This is how it happened about that three thousand. I beg you, I beseech you, to hear me. Three weeks before he murdered his father, he came to me one morning. I knew he was in want of money, and what he wanted it for. Yes, yes&#8212;to win that creature and carry her off. I knew then that he had been false to me and meant to abandon me, and it was I, I, who gave him that money, who offered it to him on the pretext of his sending it to my sister in Moscow. And as I gave it him, I looked him in the face and said that he could send it when he liked, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;in a month's time would do.&#8217;</span> How, how could he have failed to understand that I was practically telling him to his face, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You want money to be false to me with your creature, so here's the money for you. I give it to you myself. Take it, if you have so little honor as to take it!&#8217;</span> I wanted to prove what he was, and what happened? He took it, he took it, and squandered it with that creature in one night.... But he knew, he knew that I knew all about it. I assure you he understood, too, that I gave him that money to test him, to see whether he was so lost to all sense of honor as to take it from me. I looked into his eyes and he looked into mine, and he understood it all and he took it&#8212;he carried off my money!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's true, Katya,&#8221;</span> Mitya roared suddenly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I looked into your eyes and I knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your money. Despise me as a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I've deserved it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Prisoner,&#8221;</span> cried the President, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;another word and I will order you to be removed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That money was a torment to him,&#8221;</span> Katya went on with impulsive haste. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He wanted to repay it me. He wanted to, that's true; but he needed money for that creature, too. So he murdered his father, but he didn't repay me, and went off with her to that village where he was arrested. There, again, he squandered the money he had stolen after the murder of his father. And a day <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page781"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg781"></a> before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was drunk when he wrote it. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from spite, and feeling certain, positively certain, that I should never show it to any one, even if he did kill him, or else he wouldn't have written it. For he knew I shouldn't want to revenge myself and ruin him! But read it, read it attentively&#8212;more attentively, please&#8212;and you will see that he had described it all in his letter, all beforehand, how he would kill his father and where his money was kept. Look, please, don't overlook that, there's one phrase there, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I shall kill him as soon as Ivan has gone away.&#8217;</span> So he thought it all out beforehand how he would kill him,&#8221;</span> Katerina Ivanovna pointed out to the court with venomous and malignant triumph. Oh! it was clear she had studied every line of that letter and detected every meaning underlining it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If he hadn't been drunk, he wouldn't have written to me; but, look, everything is written there beforehand, just as he committed the murder after. A complete program of it!&#8221;</span> she exclaimed frantically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">She was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no doubt, she had foreseen them even a month ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking with anger, she had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not. Now she had taken the fatal plunge. I remember that the letter was read aloud by the clerk, directly afterwards, I believe. It made an overwhelming impression. They asked Mitya whether he admitted having written the letter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's mine, mine!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shouldn't have written it, if I hadn't been drunk!... We've hated each other for many things, Katya, but I swear, I swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you didn't love me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair. The prosecutor and counsel for the defense began cross-examining her, chiefly to ascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document and to give her evidence in quite a different tone and spirit just before.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, yes. I was telling lies just now. I was lying against my honor and my conscience, but I wanted to save him, for he has hated and despised me so!&#8221;</span> Katya cried madly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, he has despised me horribly, he has always despised me, and do you know, he has despised me from the very moment that I bowed down to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page782"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg782"></a> him for that money. I saw that.... I felt it at once at the time, but for a long time I wouldn't believe it. How often I have read it in his eyes, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You came of yourself, though.&#8217;</span> Oh, he didn't understand, he had no idea why I ran to him, he can suspect nothing but baseness, he judged me by himself, he thought every one was like himself!&#8221;</span> Katya hissed furiously, in a perfect frenzy. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And he only wanted to marry me, because I'd inherited a fortune, because of that, because of that! I always suspected it was because of that! Oh, he is a brute! He was always convinced that I should be trembling with shame all my life before him, because I went to him then, and that he had a right to despise me for ever for it, and so to be superior to me&#8212;that's why he wanted to marry me! That's so, that's all so! I tried to conquer him by my love&#8212;a love that knew no bounds. I even tried to forgive his faithlessness; but he understood nothing, nothing! How could he understand indeed? He is a monster! I only received that letter the next evening: it was brought me from the tavern&#8212;and only that morning, only that morning I wanted to forgive him everything, everything&#8212;even his treachery!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her. I can't help thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her hysteria and of listening to such avowals. I remember hearing them say to her, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We understand how hard it is for you; be sure we are able to feel for you,&#8221;</span> and so on, and so on. And yet they dragged the evidence out of the raving, hysterical woman. She described at last with extraordinary clearness, which is so often seen, though only for a moment, in such over-wrought states, how Ivan had been nearly driven out of his mind during the last two months trying to save <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the monster and murderer,&#8221;</span> his brother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He tortured himself,&#8221;</span> she exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;he was always trying to minimize his brother's guilt and confessing to me that he, too, had never loved his father, and perhaps desired his death himself. Oh, he has a tender, over-tender conscience! He tormented himself with his conscience! He told me everything, everything! He came every day and talked to me as his only friend. I have the honor to be his only friend!&#8221;</span> she cried suddenly with a sort of defiance, and her eyes flashed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He had been twice to see Smerdyakov. One day he came to me and said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;If it was not my brother, but Smerdyakov <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page783"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg783"></a> committed the murder&#8217;</span> (for the legend was circulating everywhere that Smerdyakov had done it), <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;perhaps I too am guilty, for Smerdyakov knew I didn't like my father and perhaps believed that I desired my father's death.&#8217;</span> Then I brought out that letter and showed it him. He was entirely convinced that his brother had done it, and he was overwhelmed by it. He couldn't endure the thought that his own brother was a parricide! Only a week ago I saw that it was making him ill. During the last few days he has talked incoherently in my presence. I saw his mind was giving way. He walked about, raving; he was seen muttering in the streets. The doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him the day before yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain fever&#8212;and all on his account, on account of this monster! And last night he learnt that Smerdyakov was dead! It was such a shock that it drove him out of his mind ... and all through this monster, all for the sake of saving the monster!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Oh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible once in a lifetime&#8212;at the hour of death, for instance, on the way to the scaffold! But it was in Katya's character, and it was such a moment in her life. It was the same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of a young profligate to save her father; the same Katya who had just before, in her pride and chastity, sacrificed herself and her maidenly modesty before all these people, telling of Mitya's generous conduct, in the hope of softening his fate a little. And now, again, she sacrificed herself; but this time it was for another, and perhaps only now&#8212;perhaps only at this moment&#8212;she felt and knew how dear that other was to her! She had sacrificed herself in terror for him, conceiving all of a sudden that he had ruined himself by his confession that it was he who had committed the murder, not his brother, she had sacrificed herself to save him, to save his good name, his reputation!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And yet one terrible doubt occurred to one&#8212;was she lying in her description of her former relations with Mitya?&#8212;that was the question. No, she had not intentionally slandered him when she cried that Mitya despised her for her bowing down to him! She believed it herself. She had been firmly convinced, perhaps ever since that bow, that the simple-hearted Mitya, who even then adored her, was laughing at her and despising her. She had loved him with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page784"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg784"></a> an hysterical, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;lacerated&#8221;</span> love only from pride, from wounded pride, and that love was not like love, but more like revenge. Oh! perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love, perhaps Katya longed for nothing more than that, but Mitya's faithlessness had wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and her heart could not forgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon her suddenly, and all that had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the offended woman's breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly. She betrayed Mitya, but she betrayed herself, too. And no sooner had she given full expression to her feelings than the tension of course was over and she was overwhelmed with shame. Hysterics began again: she fell on the floor, sobbing and screaming. She was carried out. At that moment Grushenka, with a wail, rushed towards Mitya before they had time to prevent her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mitya,&#8221;</span> she wailed, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;your serpent has destroyed you! There, she has shown you what she is!&#8221;</span> she shouted to the judges, shaking with anger. At a signal from the President they seized her and tried to remove her from the court. She wouldn't allow it. She fought and struggled to get back to Mitya. Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her. He was overpowered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Yes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have been satisfied&#8212;the show had been a varied one. Then I remember the Moscow doctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President had previously sent the court usher to arrange for medical aid for Ivan. The doctor announced to the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack of brain fever, and that he must be at once removed. In answer to questions from the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense he said that the patient had come to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and that he had warned him that he had such an attack coming on, but he had not consented to be looked after. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was certainly not in a normal state of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake, that he met several persons in the street, who were dead, and that Satan visited him every evening,&#8221;</span> said the doctor, in conclusion. Having given his evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew. The letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the material proofs. After some deliberation, the judges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page785"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg785"></a> evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the prosecutor's speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna's evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was just eight o'clock when the President returned to his seat and our prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech.</p>
