<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov's house to see Grushenka, who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with an urgent message begging him to come. Questioning Fenya, Alyosha learned that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day. During the two months that had passed since Mitya's arrest, Alyosha had called frequently at the widow Morozov's house, both from his own inclination and to take messages for Mitya. Three days after Mitya's arrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks. For one whole week she was unconscious. She was very much changed&#8212;thinner and a little sallow, though she had for the past fortnight been well enough to go out. But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive than before, and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her. A look of firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face. There were signs of a spiritual transformation in her, and a steadfast, fine and humble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her. There was a small vertical line between her brows which gave her charming face a look of concentrated thought, almost austere at the first glance. There was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It seemed strange to Alyosha, too, that in spite of the calamity that had overtaken the poor girl, betrothed to a man who had been arrested for a terrible crime, almost at the instant of their betrothal, in spite of her illness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over Mitya, Grushenka had not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness. There was a soft light in the once proud eyes, though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fire when she was visited by one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page635"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg635"></a> disturbing thought stronger than ever in her heart. The object of that uneasiness was the same as ever&#8212;Katerina Ivanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay in delirium. Alyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her. Yet Katerina Ivanovna had not once visited Mitya in his prison, though she might have done it whenever she liked. All this made a difficult problem for Alyosha, for he was the only person to whom Grushenka opened her heart and from whom she was continually asking advice. Sometimes he was unable to say anything.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Full of anxiety he entered her lodging. She was at home. She had returned from seeing Mitya half an hour before, and from the rapid movement with which she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw that she had been expecting him with great impatience. A pack of cards dealt for a game of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;fools&#8221;</span> lay on the table. A bed had been made up on the leather sofa on the other side and Maximov lay, half-reclining, on it. He wore a dressing-gown and a cotton nightcap, and was evidently ill and weak, though he was smiling blissfully. When the homeless old man returned with Grushenka from Mokroe two months before, he had simply stayed on and was still staying with her. He arrived with her in rain and sleet, sat down on the sofa, drenched and scared, and gazed mutely at her with a timid, appealing smile. Grushenka, who was in terrible grief and in the first stage of fever, almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the first half-hour after her arrival. Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently: he laughed a pitiful, helpless little laugh. She called Fenya and told her to give him something to eat. All that day he sat in the same place, almost without stirring. When it got dark and the shutters were closed, Fenya asked her mistress:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes; make him a bed on the sofa,&#8221;</span> answered Grushenka.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Questioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that he had literally nowhere to go, and that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told me straight that he wouldn't receive me again and gave me five roubles.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, God bless you, you'd better stay, then,&#8221;</span> Grushenka decided in her grief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile wrung the old man's heart and his lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her ever since. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page636"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg636"></a> did not leave the house even when she was ill. Fenya and her grandmother, the cook, did not turn him out, but went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa. Grushenka had grown used to him, and coming back from seeing Mitya (whom she had begun to visit in prison before she was really well) she would sit down and begin talking to <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Maximushka&#8221;</span> about trifling matters, to keep her from thinking of her sorrow. The old man turned out to be a good story-teller on occasions, so that at last he became necessary to her. Grushenka saw scarcely any one else beside Alyosha, who did not come every day and never stayed long. Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;at his last gasp&#8221;</span> as they said in the town, and he did, in fact, die a week after Mitya's trial. Three weeks before his death, feeling the end approaching, he made his sons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him at last and bade them not leave him again. From that moment he gave strict orders to his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him.&#8221;</span> But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've come at last!&#8221;</span> she cried, flinging down the cards and joyfully greeting Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and Maximushka's been scaring me that perhaps you wouldn't come. Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table. What will you have&#8212;coffee?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, please,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, sitting down at the table. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am very hungry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,&#8221;</span> cried Grushenka. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's been made a long time ready for you. And bring some little pies, and mind they are hot. Do you know, we've had a storm over those pies to-day. I took them to the prison for him, and would you believe it, he threw them back to me: he would not eat them. He flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it. So I said to him: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I shall leave them with the warder; if you don't eat them before evening, it will be that your venomous spite is enough for you!&#8217;</span> With that I went away. We quarreled again, would you believe it? Whenever I go we quarrel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation. Maximov, feeling nervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What did you quarrel about this time?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page637"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg637"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I didn't expect it in the least. Only fancy, he is jealous of the Pole. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why are you keeping him?&#8217;</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;So you've begun keeping him.&#8217;</span> He is jealous, jealous of me all the time, jealous eating and sleeping! He even took it into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last week.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he knew about the Pole before?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, but there it is. He has known about him from the very beginning, but to-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him. I am ashamed to repeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came out. Perhaps Rakitin is egging him on. What do you think?&#8221;</span> she added carelessly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He loves you, that's what it is: he loves you so much. And now he is particularly worried.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I should think he might be, with the trial to-morrow. And I went to him to say something about to-morrow, for I dread to think what's going to happen then. You say that he is worried, but how worried I am! And he talks about the Pole! He's too silly! He is not jealous of Maximushka yet, anyway.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My wife was dreadfully jealous over me, too,&#8221;</span> Maximov put in his word.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Jealous of you?&#8221;</span> Grushenka laughed in spite of herself. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of whom could she have been jealous?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of the servant girls.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hold your tongue, Maximushka, I am in no laughing mood now; I feel angry. Don't ogle the pies. I shan't give you any; they are not good for you, and I won't give you any vodka either. I have to look after him, too, just as though I kept an almshouse,&#8221;</span> she laughed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't deserve your kindness. I am a worthless creature,&#8221;</span> said Maximov, with tears in his voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ech, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who's of most use? If only that Pole didn't exist, Alyosha. He's taken it into his head to fall ill, too, to-day. I've been to see him also. And I shall send him some pies, too, on purpose. I hadn't sent him any, but Mitya accused me of it, so now I shall send some! Ah, here's Fenya with a letter! Yes, it's from the Poles&#8212;begging again!&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page638"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg638"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles. In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay it within three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka had received many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her former lover during the fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the two Poles had been to ask after her health during her illness. The first letter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper and with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and rhetorical that Grushenka put it down before she had read half, unable to make head or tail of it. She could not attend to letters then. The first letter was followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period. Grushenka left that letter, too, unanswered. A whole series of letters had followed&#8212;one every day&#8212;all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually diminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty-five, to ten, and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she went round herself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in great poverty, almost destitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt to their landlady. The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting her with arrogant dignity and self-assertion, with the greatest punctilio and pompous speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her former admirer ten roubles. Then, laughing, she told Mitya of it and he was not in the least jealous. But ever since, the Poles had attached themselves to Grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she had always sent them small sums. And now that day Mitya had taken it into his head to be fearfully jealous.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Like a fool, I went round to him just for a minute, on the way to see Mitya, for he is ill, too, my Pole,&#8221;</span> Grushenka began again with nervous haste. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was laughing, telling Mitya about it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Fancy,&#8217;</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;my Pole had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar. He thought I would be touched and marry him!&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page639"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg639"></a> Mitya leapt up swearing.... So, there, I'll send them the pies! Fenya, is it that little girl they've sent? Here, give her three roubles and pack a dozen pies up in a paper and tell her to take them. And you, Alyosha, be sure to tell Mitya that I did send them the pies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I wouldn't tell him for anything,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, smiling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ech! You think he is unhappy about it. Why, he's jealous on purpose. He doesn't care,&#8221;</span> said Grushenka bitterly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;On purpose?&#8221;</span> queried Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know nothing about it, with all your cleverness. I am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like me. I would be offended if he were not jealous. I am like that. I am not offended at jealousy. I have a fierce heart, too. I can be jealous myself. Only what offends me is that he doesn't love me at all. I tell you he is jealous now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">on purpose</span></em>. Am I blind? Don't I see? He began talking to me just now of that woman, of Katerina, saying she was this and that, how she had ordered a doctor from Moscow for him, to try and save him; how she had ordered the best counsel, the most learned one, too. So he loves her, if he'll praise her to my face, more shame to him! He's treated me badly himself, so he attacked me, to make out I am in fault first and to throw it all on me. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You were with your Pole before me, so I can't be blamed for Katerina,&#8217;</span> that's what it amounts to. He wants to throw the whole blame on me. He attacked me on purpose, on purpose, I tell you, but I'll&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grushenka could not finish saying what she would do. She hid her eyes in her handkerchief and sobbed violently.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He doesn't love Katerina Ivanovna,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha firmly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, whether he loves her or not, I'll soon find out for myself,&#8221;</span> said Grushenka, with a menacing note in her voice, taking the handkerchief from her eyes. Her face was distorted. Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from being mild and serene, it had become sullen and spiteful.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Enough of this foolishness,&#8221;</span> she said suddenly; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;it's not for that I sent for you. Alyosha, darling, to-morrow&#8212;what will happen to-morrow? That's what worries me! And it's only me it worries! I look at every one and no one is thinking of it. No one cares about it. Are you thinking about it even? To-morrow he'll be tried, you know. Tell me, how will he be tried? You know it's the valet, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page640"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg640"></a> valet killed him! Good heavens! Can they condemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him? They haven't troubled the valet at all, have they?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's been severely cross-examined,&#8221;</span> observed Alyosha thoughtfully; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but every one came to the conclusion it was not he. Now he is lying very ill. He has been ill ever since that attack. Really ill,&#8221;</span> added Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, dear! couldn't you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole thing by yourself? He's been brought from Petersburg for three thousand roubles, they say.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We gave these three thousand together&#8212;Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna and I&#8212;but she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself. The counsel Fetyukovitch would have charged more, but the case has become known all over Russia; it's talked of in all the papers and journals. Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because the case has become so notorious. I saw him yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well? Did you talk to him?&#8221;</span> Grushenka put in eagerly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already formed his opinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Consideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They'll ruin him. And why did she send for the doctor?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As an expert. They want to prove that Mitya's mad and committed the murder when he didn't know what he was doing&#8221;</span>; Alyosha smiled gently; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but Mitya won't agree to that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!&#8221;</span> cried Grushenka. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault, wretch that I am! But, of course, he didn't do it, he didn't do it! And they are all against him, the whole town. Even Fenya's evidence went to prove he had done it. And the people at the shop, and that official, and at the tavern, too, before, people had heard him say so! They are all, all against him, all crying out against him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, there's a fearful accumulation of evidence,&#8221;</span> Alyosha observed grimly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And Grigory&#8212;Grigory Vassilyevitch&#8212;sticks to his story that the door was open, persists that he saw it&#8212;there's no shaking him. I went and talked to him myself. He's rude about it, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page641"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg641"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, that's perhaps the strongest evidence against him,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And as for Mitya's being mad, he certainly seems like it now,&#8221;</span> Grushenka began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know, Alyosha, I've been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time. I go to him every day and simply wonder at him. Tell me, now, what do you suppose he's always talking about? He talks and talks and I can make nothing of it. I fancied he was talking of something intellectual that I couldn't understand in my foolishness. Only he suddenly began talking to me about a babe&#8212;that is, about some child. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why is the babe poor?&#8217;</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's for that babe I am going to Siberia now. I am not a murderer, but I must go to Siberia!&#8217;</span> What that meant, what babe, I couldn't tell for the life of me. Only I cried when he said it, because he said it so nicely. He cried himself, and I cried, too. He suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the cross over me. What did it mean, Alyosha, tell me? What is this babe?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It must be Rakitin, who's been going to see him lately,&#8221;</span> smiled Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;though ... that's not Rakitin's doing. I didn't see Mitya yesterday. I'll see him to-day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, it's not Rakitin; it's his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting him. It's his going to see him, that's what it is,&#8221;</span> Grushenka began, and suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan's going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself that Ivan hasn't been once.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There ... there! What a girl I am! Blurring things out!&#8221;</span> exclaimed Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, Alyosha, hush! Since I've said so much I'll tell the whole truth&#8212;he's been to see him twice, the first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He told Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to tell any one, in fact. He came secretly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently impressed him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ivan doesn't talk to me of Mitya's case,&#8221;</span> he said slowly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's said very little to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him, he seems vexed at my coming, so I've not been to him <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page642"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg642"></a> for the last three weeks. H'm!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There has been a change,&#8221;</span> Grushenka assented quickly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They have a secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, and such a secret that Mitya can't rest. Before then, he was cheerful&#8212;and, indeed, he is cheerful now&#8212;but when he shakes his head like that, you know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his right temple with his right hand, I know there is something on his mind worrying him.... I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to-day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you said he was worried.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him&#8212;with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Don't tell him&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he told me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Don't tell him.&#8217;</span> It's you that Mitya's most afraid of. Because it's a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,&#8221;</span> Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Set my mind at rest that I may know the worst that's in store for me. That's why I sent for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You think it's something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn't have told you there was a secret.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn't dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won't tell me what it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you think yourself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do I think? It's the end for me, that's what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina's in it. It's all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand&#8212;warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that's the whole secret. They've planned it together, the three of them&#8212;Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I've been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page643"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg643"></a> because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I won't tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I think.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, that's what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, that's what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can't disguise what he is doing; he is so open, you know.... But I'll give it to him, I'll give it to him! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You believe I did it,&#8217;</span> he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive him! You wait, I'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I'll just say a word then ... I'll tell everything then!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And again she cried bitterly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,&#8221;</span> Alyosha said, getting up. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;First, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don't want to worm his secret out of him, but if he'll tell me of himself to-day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you. Then I'll come to you to-day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something else. That's certain. It isn't likely it's about Katerina Ivanovna, it seems to me. Good-by for now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He saw that she put little faith in his consolation, but she was better for having had her sorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was sorry to leave her in such a state of mind, but he was in haste. He had a great many things to do still.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00086"><span class="c9">Chapter II. The Injured Foot</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov, and he hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not be too late for Mitya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last three weeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page644"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg644"></a> and though she was not in bed, she lay all day half-reclining on the couch in her boudoir, in a fascinating but decorous <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">d&#233;shabill&#233;</span></span>. Alyosha had once noted with innocent amusement that, in spite of her illness, Madame Hohlakov had begun to be rather dressy&#8212;top-knots, ribbons, loose wrappers, had made their appearance, and he had an inkling of the reason, though he dismissed such ideas from his mind as frivolous. During the last two months the young official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go straight to Lise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had sent a maid to him the previous day, specially asking him to come to her <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;about something very important,&#8221;</span> a request which, for certain reasons, had interest for Alyosha. But while the maid went to take his name in to Lise, Madame Hohlakov heard of his arrival from some one, and immediately sent to beg him to come to her <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;just for one minute.&#8221;</span> Alyosha reflected that it was better to accede to the mamma's request, or else she would be sending down to Lise's room every minute that he was there. Madame Hohlakov was lying on a couch. She was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in a state of extreme nervous excitement. She greeted Alyosha with cries of rapture.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's ages, ages, perfect ages since I've seen you! It's a whole week&#8212;only think of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago, on Wednesday. You have come to see Lise. I'm sure you meant to slip into her room on tiptoe, without my hearing you. My dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you only knew how worried I am about her! But of that later, though that's the most important thing, of that later. Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you implicitly with my Lise. Since the death of Father Zossima&#8212;God rest his soul!&#8221;</span> (she crossed herself)&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I look upon you as a monk, though you look charming in your new suit. Where did you find such a tailor in these parts? No, no, that's not the chief thing&#8212;of that later. Forgive me for sometimes calling you Alyosha; an old woman like me may take liberties,&#8221;</span> she smiled coquettishly; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but that will do later, too. The important thing is that I shouldn't forget what is important. Please remind me of it yourself. As soon as my tongue runs away with me, you just say <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the important thing?&#8217;</span> Ach! how do I know now what is of most importance? Ever since <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page645"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg645"></a> Lise took back her promise&#8212;her childish promise, Alexey Fyodorovitch&#8212;to marry you, you've realized, of course, that it was only the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her chair&#8212;thank God, she can walk now!... that new doctor Katya sent for from Moscow for your unhappy brother, who will to-morrow&#8212;But why speak of to-morrow? I am ready to die at the very thought of to-morrow. Ready to die of curiosity.... That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise.... I paid him fifty roubles for the visit. But that's not the point, that's not the point again. You see, I'm mixing everything up. I am in such a hurry. Why am I in a hurry? I don't understand. It's awful how I seem growing unable to understand anything. Everything seems mixed up in a sort of tangle. I am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away, and that will be all I shall see of you. Goodness! Why are we sitting here and no coffee? Yulia, Glafira, coffee!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just had coffee.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At Agrafena Alexandrovna's.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At ... at that woman's? Ah, it's she has brought ruin on every one. I know nothing about it though. They say she has become a saint, though it's rather late in the day. She had better have done it before. What use is it now? Hush, hush, Alexey Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to say to you that I am afraid I shall tell you nothing. This awful trial ... I shall certainly go, I am making arrangements. I shall be carried there in my chair; besides I can sit up. I shall have people with me. And, you know, I am a witness. How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I don't know what I shall say. One has to take an oath, hasn't one?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes; but I don't think you will be able to go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage act, and then they are all going to Siberia, some are getting married, and all this so quickly, so quickly, everything's changing, and at last&#8212;nothing. All grow old and have death to look forward to. Well, so be it! I am weary. This Katya, <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">cette charmante personne</span></span>, has disappointed all my hopes. Now she is going to follow one of your brothers to Siberia, and your other brother is going to follow <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page646"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg646"></a> her, and will live in the nearest town, and they will all torment one another. It drives me out of my mind. Worst of all&#8212;the publicity. The story has been told a million times over in all the papers in Moscow and Petersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it, there's a paragraph that I was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;a dear friend&#8217;</span> of your brother's &#8212;&#8212;, I can't repeat the horrid word. Just fancy, just fancy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Impossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday. Here, in the Petersburg paper <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Gossip</span></span>. The paper began coming out this year. I am awfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now it pays me out&#8212;this is what gossip comes to! Here it is, here, this passage. Read it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under her pillow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed and perhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head. The paragraph was very typical, and must have been a great shock to her, but, fortunately perhaps, she was unable to keep her mind fixed on any one subject at that moment, and so might race off in a minute to something else and quite forget the newspaper.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread all over Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about his brother, about the Karamazovs, and about himself he had read in the course of those two months, among other equally credible items! One paper had even stated that he had gone into a monastery and become a monk, in horror at his brother's crime. Another contradicted this, and stated that he and his elder, Father Zossima, had broken into the monastery chest and <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;made tracks from the monastery.&#8221;</span> The present paragraph in the paper <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Gossip</span></span> was under the heading, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk.&#8221;</span> (That, alas! was the name of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.) It was brief, and Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it. No names appeared, in fact. It was merely stated that the criminal, whose approaching trial was making such a sensation&#8212;retired army captain, an idle swaggerer, and reactionary bully&#8212;was continually involved in amorous intrigues, and particularly popular with certain ladies <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;who were pining in solitude.&#8221;</span> One such lady, a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had a grown-up <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page647"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg647"></a> daughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before the crime she offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that he would elope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting on escaping punishment, had preferred to murder his father to get the three thousand rather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged charms of his pining lady. This playful paragraph finished, of course, with an outburst of generous indignation at the wickedness of parricide and at the lately abolished institution of serfdom. Reading it with curiosity, Alyosha folded up the paper and handed it back to Madame Hohlakov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, that must be me,&#8221;</span> she hurried on again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course I am meant. Scarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold mines to him, and here they talk of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;middle-aged charms&#8217;</span> as though that were my motive! He writes that out of spite! God Almighty forgive him for the middle-aged charms, as I forgive him! You know it's&#8212; Do you know who it is? It's your friend Rakitin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;though I've heard nothing about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's he, it's he! No <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;perhaps&#8217;</span> about it. You know I turned him out of the house.... You know all that story, don't you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but why it was, I haven't heard ... from you, at least.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, then you've heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose, abuses me dreadfully?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he does; but then he abuses every one. But why you've given him up I haven't heard from him either. I meet him very seldom now, indeed. We are not friends.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, then, I'll tell you all about it. There's no help for it, I'll confess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame. Only a little, little point, so little that perhaps it doesn't count. You see, my dear boy&#8221;</span>&#8212;Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming, though enigmatic, smile played about her lips&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;you see, I suspect ... You must forgive me, Alyosha. I am like a mother to you.... No, no; quite the contrary. I speak to you now as though you were my father&#8212;mother's quite out of place. Well, it's as though I were confessing to Father Zossima, that's just it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man, your friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I can't be angry with him. I feel cross, but not very), that frivolous young man, would you believe <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page648"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg648"></a> it, seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me. I only noticed it later. At first&#8212;a month ago&#8212;he only began to come oftener to see me, almost every day; though, of course, we were acquainted before. I knew nothing about it ... and suddenly it dawned upon me, and I began to notice things with surprise. You know, two months ago, that modest, charming, excellent young man, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, who's in the service here, began to be a regular visitor at the house. You met him here ever so many times yourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man, isn't he? He comes once every three days, not every day (though I should be glad to see him every day), and always so well dressed. Altogether, I love young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he has almost the mind of a statesman, he talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly, certainly try and get promotion for him. He is a future diplomat. On that awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night. And your friend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always stretches them out on the carpet.... He began hinting at his feelings, in fact, and one day, as he was going, he squeezed my hand terribly hard. My foot began to swell directly after he pressed my hand like that. He had met Pyotr Ilyitch here before, and would you believe it, he is always gibing at him, growling at him, for some reason. I simply looked at the way they went on together and laughed inwardly. So I was sitting here alone&#8212;no, I was laid up then. Well, I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in, and only fancy! brought me some verses of his own composition&#8212;a short poem, on my bad foot: that is, he described my foot in a poem. Wait a minute&#8212;how did it go?</span></p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">A captivating little foot.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">It began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I've got it here. I'll show it to you later. But it's a charming thing&#8212;charming; and, you know, it's not only about the foot, it had a good moral, too, a charming idea, only I've forgotten it; in fact, it was just the thing for an album. So, of course, I thanked him, and he was evidently flattered. I'd hardly had time to thank him when in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenly looked as black as night. I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way, for Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses. I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page649"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg649"></a> had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in. I showed Pyotr Ilyitch the verses and didn't say who was the author. But I am convinced that he guessed, though he won't own it to this day, and declares he had no idea. But he says that on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at once, and fell to criticizing it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Wretched doggerel,&#8217;</span> he said they were, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;some divinity student must have written them,&#8217;</span> and with such vehemence, such vehemence! Then, instead of laughing, your friend flew into a rage. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Good gracious!&#8217;</span> I thought, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;they'll fly at each other.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It was I who wrote them,&#8217;</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I wrote them as a joke,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;for I think it degrading to write verses.... But they are good poetry. They want to put a monument to your Pushkin for writing about women's feet, while I wrote with a moral purpose, and you,&#8217;</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;are an advocate of serfdom. You've no humane ideas,&#8217;</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You have no modern enlightened feelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you are a mere official,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and you take bribes.&#8217;</span> Then I began screaming and imploring them. And, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward. He at once took up the most gentlemanly tone, looked at him sarcastically, listened, and apologized. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'd no idea,&#8217;</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I shouldn't have said it, if I had known. I should have praised it. Poets are all so irritable,&#8217;</span> he said. In short, he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone. He explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought he was in earnest. Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Would it, or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out for shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?&#8217;</span> And, would you believe it, I lay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the proper thing or not. I kept worrying and worrying, and my heart began to beat, and I couldn't make up my mind whether to make an outcry or not. One voice seemed to be telling me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Speak,&#8217;</span> and the other <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;No, don't speak.&#8217;</span> And no sooner had the second voice said that than I cried out, and fainted. Of course, there was a fuss. I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's painful for me to say it, but I don't wish to see you in my house again.&#8217;</span> So I turned him out. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting it on. I wasn't angry with him at all, really; but I suddenly fancied&#8212;that was what did it&#8212;that it would be such a fine scene.... And yet, believe me, it was quite natural, for I really shed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page650"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg650"></a> tears and cried for several days afterwards, and then suddenly, one afternoon, I forgot all about it. So it's a fortnight since he's been here, and I kept wondering whether he would come again. I wondered even yesterday, then suddenly last night came this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Gossip</span></span>. I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He must have written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot, sent it, and they put it in. It was a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha, it's awful how I keep talking and don't say what I want to say. Ah! the words come of themselves!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day,&#8221;</span> Alyosha faltered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen, what is an aberration?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What aberration?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha, wondering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable. Whatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she is a charming, charming creature, only I never can make out who it is she is in love with. She was with me some time ago and I couldn't get anything out of her. Especially as she won't talk to me except on the surface now. She is always talking about my health and nothing else, and she takes up such a tone with me, too. I simply said to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Well, so be it. I don't care&#8217;</span>... Oh, yes. I was talking of aberration. This doctor has come. You know a doctor has come? Of course, you know it&#8212;the one who discovers madmen. You wrote for him. No, it wasn't you, but Katya. It's all Katya's doing. Well, you see, a man may be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration. He may be conscious and know what he is doing and yet be in a state of aberration. And there's no doubt that Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from aberration. They found out about aberration as soon as the law courts were reformed. It's all the good effect of the reformed law courts. The doctor has been here and questioned me about that evening, about the gold mines. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;How did he seem then?&#8217;</span> he asked me. He must have been in a state of aberration. He came in shouting, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Money, money, three thousand! Give me three thousand!&#8217;</span> and then went away and immediately did the murder. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I don't want to murder him,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page651"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg651"></a> and he suddenly went and murdered him. That's why they'll acquit him, because he struggled against it and yet he murdered him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he didn't murder him,&#8221;</span> Alyosha interrupted rather sharply. He felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Grigory?&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down, and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But why, why?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Suffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from aberration; he went and committed the murder. As for his saying he didn't, he very likely doesn't remember. Only, you know, it'll be better, ever so much better, if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him. And that's how it must have been, though I say it was Grigory. It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that's better, ever so much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed his father, I don't defend that. Children ought to honor their parents, and yet it would be better if it were he, as you'd have nothing to cry over then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was conscious, but did not know what he was doing. Let them acquit him&#8212;that's so humane, and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are. I knew nothing about it, but they say they have been so a long time. And when I heard it yesterday, I was so struck by it that I wanted to send for you at once. And if he is acquitted, make him come straight from the law courts to dinner with me, and I'll have a party of friends, and we'll drink to the reformed law courts. I don't believe he'd be dangerous; besides, I'll invite a great many friends, so that he could always be led out if he did anything. And then he might be made a justice of the peace or something in another town, for those who have been in trouble themselves make the best judges. And, besides, who isn't suffering from aberration nowadays?&#8212;you, I, all of us are in a state of aberration, and there are ever so many examples of it: a man sits singing a song, suddenly something annoys him, he takes a pistol and shoots the first person he comes across, and no one blames him for it. I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page652"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg652"></a> doctors are always confirming; they confirm anything. Why, my Lise is in a state of aberration. She made me cry again yesterday, and the day before, too, and to-day I suddenly realized that it's all due to aberration. Oh, Lise grieves me so! I believe she's quite mad. Why did she send for you? Did she send for you or did you come of yourself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her.&#8221;</span> Alyosha got up resolutely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that's what's most important,&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into tears. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God knows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it's no matter her sending for you on the sly, without telling her mother. But forgive me, I can't trust my daughter so easily to your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch, though I still consider him the most chivalrous young man. But only fancy, he's been to see Lise and I knew nothing about it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How? What? When?&#8221;</span> Alyosha was exceedingly surprised. He had not sat down again and listened standing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will tell you; that's perhaps why I asked you to come, for I don't know now why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch has been to see me twice, since he came back from Moscow. First time he came as a friend to call on me, and the second time Katya was here and he came because he heard she was here. I didn't, of course, expect him to come often, knowing what a lot he has to do as it is, <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">vous comprenez, cette affaire et la mort terrible de votre papa</span></span>. But I suddenly heard he'd been here again, not to see me but to see Lise. That's six days ago now. He came, stayed five minutes, and went away. And I didn't hear of it till three days afterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me. I sent for Lise directly. She laughed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He thought you were asleep,&#8217;</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and came in to me to ask after your health.&#8217;</span> Of course, that's how it happened. But Lise, Lise, mercy on us, how she distresses me! Would you believe it, one night, four days ago, just after you saw her last time, and had gone away, she suddenly had a fit, screaming, shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I never have hysterics? Then, next day another fit, and the same thing on the third, and yesterday too, and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenly screamed out, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never letting him come to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page653"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg653"></a> the house again.&#8217;</span> I was struck dumb at these amazing words, and answered, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent young man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?&#8217;</span>&#8212;for all this business is a misfortune, isn't it? She suddenly burst out laughing at my words, and so rudely, you know. Well, I was pleased; I thought I had amused her and the fits would pass off, especially as I wanted to refuse to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his strange visits without my knowledge, and meant to ask him for an explanation. But early this morning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would you believe it, slapped her in the face. That's monstrous; I am always polite to my servants. And an hour later she was hugging Yulia's feet and kissing them. She sent a message to me that she wasn't coming to me at all, and would never come and see me again, and when I dragged myself down to her, she rushed to kiss me, crying, and as she kissed me, she pushed me out of the room without saying a word, so I couldn't find out what was the matter. Now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I rest all my hopes on you, and, of course, my whole life is in your hands. I simply beg you to go to Lise and find out everything from her, as you alone can, and come back and tell me&#8212;me, her mother, for you understand it will be the death of me, simply the death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away. I can stand no more. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then ... then something awful will happen. Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr Ilyitch!&#8221;</span> cried Madame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she saw Perhotin enter the room. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are late, you are late! Well, sit down, speak, put us out of suspense. What does the counsel say. Where are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To Lise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, yes. You won't forget, you won't forget what I asked you? It's a question of life and death!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course, I won't forget, if I can ... but I am so late,&#8221;</span> muttered Alyosha, beating a hasty retreat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, be sure, be sure to come in; don't say <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;If you can.&#8217;</span> I shall die if you don't,&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov called after him, but Alyosha had already left the room.</p>
