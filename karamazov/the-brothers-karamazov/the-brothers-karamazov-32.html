<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00059"><span class="c9">Chapter III. Gold-Mines</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">This was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to Rakitin with such horror. She was just then expecting the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;message,&#8221;</span> and was much relieved that Mitya had not been to see her that day or the day before. She hoped that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;please God he won't come till I'm gone away,&#8221;</span> and he suddenly burst in on her. The rest we know already. To get him off her hands she suggested at once that he should walk with her to Samsonov's, where she said she absolutely must go <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;to settle his accounts,&#8221;</span> and when Mitya accompanied her at once, she said good-by to him at the gate, making him promise to come at twelve o'clock to take her home again. Mitya, too, was delighted at this arrangement. If she was sitting at Samsonov's she could not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;if only she's not lying,&#8221;</span> he added at once. But he thought she was not lying from what he saw.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved woman, at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be happening to her, and how she may be betraying him, but, when shaken, heartbroken, convinced of her faithlessness, he runs back to her; at the first glance at her face, her gay, laughing, affectionate face, he revives at once, lays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses himself for his jealousy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he had so much still to do that day! But a load had been lifted from his heart, anyway.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov whether anything happened there last night, whether, by any chance, she went to Fyodor Pavlovitch; ough!&#8221;</span> floated through his mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Before he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up again in his restless heart.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg425"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Jealousy! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Othello was not jealous, he was trustful,&#8221;</span> observed Pushkin. And that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our great poet. Othello's soul was shattered and his whole outlook clouded simply because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">his ideal was destroyed</span></em>. But Othello did not begin hiding, spying, peeping. He was trustful, on the contrary. He had to be led up, pushed on, excited with great difficulty before he could entertain the idea of deceit. The truly jealous man is not like that. It is impossible to picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealous man can descend without a qualm of conscience. And yet it's not as though the jealous were all vulgar and base souls. On the contrary, a man of lofty feelings, whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice, may yet hide under tables, bribe the vilest people, and be familiar with the lowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness&#8212;not incapable of forgiving it, but of making up his mind to it&#8212;though his soul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe's. It is not so with the really jealous man. It is hard to imagine what some jealous men can make up their mind to and overlook, and what they can forgive! The jealous are the readiest of all to forgive, and all women know it. The jealous man can forgive extraordinarily quickly (though, of course, after a violent scene), and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved, the very kisses and embraces he has seen, if only he can somehow be convinced that it has all been <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;for the last time,&#8221;</span> and that his rival will vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of the earth, or that he himself will carry her away somewhere, where that dreaded rival will not get near her. Of course the reconciliation is only for an hour. For, even if the rival did disappear next day, he would invent another one and would be jealous of him. And one might wonder what there was in a love that had to be so watched over, what a love could be worth that needed such strenuous guarding. But that the jealous will never understand. And yet among them are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that those very men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening and spying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment, anyway, though they understand clearly enough with their <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;noble hearts&#8221;</span> the shameful depths to which they have voluntarily sunk.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg426"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At the sight of Grushenka, Mitya's jealousy vanished, and, for an instant he became trustful and generous, and positively despised himself for his evil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love for the woman, there was an element of something far higher than he himself imagined, that it was not only a sensual passion, not only the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;curve of her body,&#8221;</span> of which he had talked to Alyosha. But, as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began to suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no sting of conscience at it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to make haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small, temporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all gone on his expedition. And, as we all know, one can't take a step without money. But he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan. He had a brace of fine dueling pistols in a case, which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above all his possessions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Metropolis&#8221;</span> tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with a young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons. He used to buy pistols, revolvers, daggers, hang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances. He prided himself on them, and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya, without stopping to think, went straight to him, and offered to pawn his pistols to him for ten roubles. The official, delighted, began trying to persuade him to sell them outright. But Mitya would not consent, so the young man gave him ten roubles, protesting that nothing would induce him to take interest. They parted friends.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch's by the back way, to his arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as possible. In this way the fact was established that three or four hours before a certain event, of which I shall speak later on, Mitya had not a farthing, and pawned for ten roubles a possession he valued, though, three hours later, he was in possession of thousands.... But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna (the woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitch's) he learned the very disturbing fact of Smerdyakov's illness. He heard the story of his fall in the cellar, his fit, the doctor's visit, Fyodor Pavlovitch's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg427"></a> anxiety; he heard with interest, too, that his brother Ivan had set off that morning for Moscow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then he must have driven through Volovya before me,&#8221;</span> thought Dmitri, but he was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What will happen now? Who'll keep watch for me? Who'll bring me word?&#8221;</span> he thought. He began greedily questioning the women whether they had seen anything the evening before. They quite understood what he was trying to find out, and completely reassured him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been there the night; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya grew thoughtful. He would certainly have to keep watch to-day, but where? Here or at Samsonov's gate? He decided that he must be on the look out both here and there, and meanwhile ... meanwhile.... The difficulty was that he had to carry out the new plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sure of its success, but he must not delay acting upon it. Mitya resolved to sacrifice an hour to it: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In an hour I shall know everything, I shall settle everything, and then, then, first of all to Samsonov's. I'll inquire whether Grushenka's there and instantly be back here again, stay till eleven, and then to Samsonov's again to bring her home.&#8221;</span> This was what he decided.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes, dressed, and went to Madame Hohlakov's. Alas! he had built his hopes on her. He had resolved to borrow three thousand from that lady. And what was more, he felt suddenly convinced that she would not refuse to lend it to him. It may be wondered why, if he felt so certain, he had not gone to her at first, one of his own sort, so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he did not know, who was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how to speak.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and had seen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew she could not endure him. She had detested him from the first because he was engaged to Katerina Ivanovna, while she had, for some reason, suddenly conceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over, and marry the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;charming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.&#8221;</span> Mitya's manners she detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and had once said about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was uncultivated. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg428"></a> But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck him: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna&#8221;</span> (and he knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;why should she refuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me to leave Katya and get away from her for ever. These spoilt fine ladies, if they set their hearts on anything, will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice. Besides, she's so rich,&#8221;</span> Mitya argued.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">As for his <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;plan&#8221;</span> it was just the same as before; it consisted of the offer of his rights to Tchermashnya&#8212;but not with a commercial object, as it had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady with the possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand&#8212;but simply as a security for the debt. As he worked out this new idea, Mitya was enchanted with it, but so it always was with him in all his undertakings, in all his sudden decisions. He gave himself up to every new idea with passionate enthusiasm. Yet, when he mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakov's house he felt a shiver of fear run down his spine. At that moment he saw fully, as a mathematical certainty, that this was his last hope, that if this broke down, nothing else was left him in the world, but to <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;rob and murder some one for the three thousand.&#8221;</span> It was half-past seven when he rang at the bell.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was announced he was received with extraordinary rapidity. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As though she were waiting for me,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya, and as soon as he had been led to the drawing-room, the lady of the house herself ran in, and declared at once that she was expecting him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I'd no reason to suppose you would come to see me, as you will admit yourself. Yet, I did expect you. You may marvel at my instinct, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but I was convinced all the morning that you would come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That is certainly wonderful, madam,&#8221;</span> observed Mitya, sitting down limply, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but I have come to you on a matter of great importance.... On a matter of supreme importance for me, that is, madam ... for me alone ... and I hasten&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know you've come on most important business, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; it's not a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking back to the miraculous (have you heard about Father Zossima?). <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg429"></a> This is a case of mathematics: you couldn't help coming, after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna; you couldn't, you couldn't, that's a mathematical certainty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The realism of actual life, madam, that's what it is. But allow me to explain&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm all for realism now. I've seen too much of miracles. You've heard that Father Zossima is dead?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, madam, it's the first time I've heard of it.&#8221;</span> Mitya was a little surprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Last night, and only imagine&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Madam,&#8221;</span> said Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I can imagine nothing except that I'm in a desperate position, and that if you don't help me, everything will come to grief, and I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality of the expression, but I'm in a fever&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know, I know that you're in a fever. You could hardly fail to be, and whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have long been thinking over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching over it and studying it.... Oh, believe me, I'm an experienced doctor of the soul, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I'm certainly an experienced patient,&#8221;</span> said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and I feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help in my ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you.... I have come, madam&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't explain it. It's of secondary importance. But as for help, you're not the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have most likely heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband was ruined, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;had come to grief,&#8217;</span> as you characteristically express it, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I recommended him to take to horse-breeding, and now he's doing well. Have you any idea of horse-breeding, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, in nervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I simply implore you, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two minutes of free speech that I may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with which I have come. Besides, I am short of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg430"></a> time. I'm in a fearful hurry,&#8221;</span> Mitya cried hysterically, feeling that she was just going to begin talking again, and hoping to cut her short. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have come in despair ... in the last gasp of despair, to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on safe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees! Only let me explain&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her turn, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and whatever you may tell me, I know it all beforehand; I've told you so already. You ask for a certain sum, for three thousand, but I can give you more, immeasurably more, I will save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya started from his seat again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Madam, will you really be so good!&#8221;</span> he cried, with strong feeling. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good God, you've saved me! You have saved a man from a violent death, from a bullet.... My eternal gratitude&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!&#8221;</span> cried Madame Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya's ecstasy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Infinitely? But I don't need so much. I only need that fatal three thousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum with infinite gratitude, and I propose a plan which&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it's said and done.&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov cut him short, with the modest triumph of beneficence: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have promised to save you, and I will save you. I will save you as I did Belmesov. What do you think of the gold-mines, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of the gold-mines, madam? I have never thought anything about them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over and over again. I have been watching you for the last month. I've watched you a hundred times as you've walked past, saying to myself: That's a man of energy who ought to be at the gold-mines. I've studied your gait and come to the conclusion: that's a man who would find gold.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From my gait, madam?&#8221;</span> said Mitya, smiling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, from your gait. You surely don't deny that character can be told from the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the idea. I'm all for science and realism now. After all this business <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg431"></a> with Father Zossima, which has so upset me, from this very day I'm a realist and I want to devote myself to practical usefulness. I'm cured. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Enough!&#8217;</span> as Turgenev says.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov cut in at once. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three million, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. I'll make you a present of the idea: you shall find gold-mines, make millions, return and become a leading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things. Are we to leave it all to the Jews? You will found institutions and enterprises of all sorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You'll become famous and indispensable to the Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; people don't know that side of me&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Madam, madam!&#8221;</span> Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam.... I shall perhaps set off ... to the gold-mines.... I'll come and see you again about it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand you so generously ... oh, that would set me free, and if you could to-day ... you see, I haven't a minute, a minute to lose to-day&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov interrupted emphatically. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The question is, will you go to the gold-mines or not; have you quite made up your mind? Answer yes or no.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will go, madam, afterwards.... I'll go where you like ... but now&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Wait!&#8221;</span> cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running to a handsome bureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling out one drawer after another, looking for something with desperate haste.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The three thousand,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and at the instant ... without any papers or formalities ... that's doing things in gentlemanly style! She's a splendid woman, if only she didn't talk so much!&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg432"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here!&#8221;</span> cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;here is what I was looking for!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next the skin with a cross.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> she went on reverently, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;from the relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put it on your neck myself, and with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new career.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And she actually put the cord round his neck, and began arranging it. In extreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped her, and at last he got it under his neck-tie and collar through his shirt to his chest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Now you can set off,&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting down triumphantly in her place again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Madam, I am so touched. I don't know how to thank you, indeed ... for such kindness, but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me.... That sum of money, for which I shall be indebted to your generosity.... Oh, madam, since you are so kind, so touchingly generous to me,&#8221;</span> Mitya exclaimed impulsively, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;then let me reveal to you ... though, of course, you've known it a long time ... that I love somebody here.... I have been false to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh, I've behaved inhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here with another woman ... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise, for you know everything already, but whom I cannot leave on any account, and therefore that three thousand now&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov interrupted in the most decisive tone. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Leave everything, especially women. Gold-mines are your goal, and there's no place for women there. Afterwards, when you come back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in the highest society. That will be a modern girl, a girl of education and advanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have gained ground, and the new woman will have appeared.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Madam, that's not the point, not at all....&#8221;</span> Mitya clasped his hands in entreaty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thing you're yearning for, though you don't realize it yourself. I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg433"></a> am not at all opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The development of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in the near future&#8212;that's my ideal. I've a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, people don't know that side of me. I wrote a letter to the author, Shtchedrin, on that subject. He has taught me so much, so much about the vocation of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous letter of two lines: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman. Persevere.&#8217;</span> And I signed myself, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;A Mother.&#8217;</span> I thought of signing myself <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;A contemporary Mother,&#8217;</span> and hesitated, but I stuck to the simple <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Mother&#8217;</span>; there's more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. And the word <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;contemporary&#8217;</span> might have reminded him of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">The Contemporary</span></span>&#8217;</span>&#8212;a painful recollection owing to the censorship.... Good Heavens, what is the matter!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Madam!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands before her in helpless entreaty. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You will make me weep if you delay what you have so generously&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! That's a noble feeling ... such a path lies open before you! Tears will ease your heart, and later on you will return rejoicing. You will hasten to me from Siberia on purpose to share your joy with me&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But allow me, too!&#8221;</span> Mitya cried suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For the last time I entreat you, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to-day, if not, when may I come for it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The three thousand you promised me ... that you so generously&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven't got three thousand,&#8221;</span> Madame Hohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya was stupefied.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as good as in my hands&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that case you misunderstood me. I was talking of the gold-mines. It's true I promised you more, infinitely more than three thousand, I remember it all now, but I was referring to the gold-mines.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But the money? The three thousand?&#8221;</span> Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg434"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, if you meant money, I haven't any. I haven't a penny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm quarreling with my steward about it, and I've just borrowed five hundred roubles from Mi&#252;sov, myself. No, no, I've no money. And, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, if I had, I wouldn't give it to you. In the first place I never lend money. Lending money means losing friends. And I wouldn't give it to you particularly. I wouldn't give it you, because I like you and want to save you, for all you need is the gold-mines, the gold-mines, the gold-mines!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, the devil!&#8221;</span> roared Mitya, and with all his might brought his fist down on the table.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Aie! Aie!&#8221;</span> cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew to the other end of the drawing-room.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out of the house, into the street, into the darkness! He walked like one possessed, and beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he had struck himself two days previously, before Alyosha, the last time he saw him in the dark, on the road. What those blows upon his breast signified, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">on that spot</span></em>, and what he meant by it&#8212;that was, for the time, a secret which was known to no one in the world, and had not been told even to Alyosha. But that secret meant for him more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide. So he had determined, if he did not get hold of the three thousand that would pay his debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his breast, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">that spot on his breast</span></em>, the shame he carried upon it, that weighed on his conscience. All this will be fully explained to the reader later on, but now that his last hope had vanished, this man, so strong in appearance, burst out crying like a little child a few steps from the Hohlakovs' house. He walked on, and not knowing what he was doing, wiped away his tears with his fist. In this way he reached the square, and suddenly became aware that he had stumbled against something. He heard a piercing wail from an old woman whom he had almost knocked down.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good Lord, you've nearly killed me! Why don't you look where you're going, scapegrace?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, it's you!&#8221;</span> cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the dark. It was the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom Mitya had particularly noticed the day before.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg435"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And who are you, my good sir?&#8221;</span> said the old woman, in quite a different voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know you in the dark.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch's. You're the servant there?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch's.... But I don't know you now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?&#8221;</span> said Mitya, beside himself with suspense. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I saw her to the house some time ago.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went off again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What? Went away?&#8221;</span> cried Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;When did she go?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only told Kuzma Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she ran away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're lying, damn you!&#8221;</span> roared Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Aie! Aie!&#8221;</span> shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At the moment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona, in the kitchen when <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the captain&#8221;</span> ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on seeing him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You scream?&#8221;</span> roared Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;where is she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a word, he fell all of a heap at her feet.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Fenya, for Christ's sake, tell me, where is she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don't know. You may kill me but I can't tell you.&#8221;</span> Fenya swore and protested. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You went out with her yourself not long ago&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She came back!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Indeed she didn't. By God I swear she didn't come back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're lying!&#8221;</span> shouted Mitya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;From your terror I know where she is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so easily. But she knew very well that it was only that he was in such haste, or she might not have fared so well. But as he ran, he surprised both Fenya and old Matryona by an unexpected action. On the table stood a brass mortar, with a pestle in it, a small brass <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg436"></a> pestle, not much more than six inches long. Mitya already had opened the door with one hand when, with the other, he snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his side-pocket.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, Lord! He's going to murder some one!&#8221;</span> cried Fenya, flinging up her hands.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00060"><span class="c9">Chapter IV. In The Dark</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Where was he running? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where could she be except at Fyodor Pavlovitch's? She must have run straight to him from Samsonov's, that was clear now. The whole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.&#8221;</span> ... It all rushed whirling through his mind. He did not run to Marya Kondratyevna's. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There was no need to go there ... not the slightest need ... he must raise no alarm ... they would run and tell directly.... Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in the plot, Smerdyakov too, he too, all had been bought over!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round Fyodor Pavlovitch's house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky Street, then over the little bridge, and so came straight to the deserted alley at the back, which was empty and uninhabited, with, on one side the hurdle fence of a neighbor's kitchen-garden, on the other the strong high fence, that ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. Here he chose a spot, apparently the very place, where according to the tradition, he knew Lizaveta had once climbed over it: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If she could climb over it,&#8221;</span> the thought, God knows why, occurred to him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;surely I can.&#8221;</span> He did in fact jump up, and instantly contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence. Then he vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it. Close by, in the garden stood the bath-house, but from the fence he could see the lighted windows of the house too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, the old man's bedroom is lighted up. She's there!&#8221;</span> and he leapt from the fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory was ill and very likely Smerdyakov, too, and that there was no one to hear him, he instinctively hid himself, stood still, and began to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg437"></a> listen. But there was dead silence on all sides and, as though of design, complete stillness, not the slightest breath of wind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And naught but the whispering silence,&#8221;</span> the line for some reason rose to his mind. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If only no one heard me jump over the fence! I think not.&#8221;</span> Standing still for a minute, he walked softly over the grass in the garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He walked slowly, creeping stealthily at every step, listening to his own footsteps. It took him five minutes to reach the lighted window. He remembered that just under the window there were several thick and high bushes of elder and whitebeam. The door from the house into the garden on the left-hand side, was shut; he had carefully looked on purpose to see, in passing. At last he reached the bushes and hid behind them. He held his breath. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I must wait now,&#8221;</span> he thought, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;to reassure them, in case they heard my footsteps and are listening ... if only I don't cough or sneeze.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at moments, he could scarcely breathe. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, this throbbing at my heart won't stop,&#8221;</span> he thought. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I can't wait any longer.&#8221;</span> He was standing behind a bush in the shadow. The light of the window fell on the front part of the bush.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How red the whitebeam berries are!&#8221;</span> he murmured, not knowing why. Softly and noiselessly, step by step, he approached the window, and raised himself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch's bedroom lay open before him. It was not a large room, and was divided in two parts by a red screen, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Chinese,&#8221;</span> as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to call it. The word <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Chinese&#8221;</span> flashed into Mitya's mind, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and behind the screen, is Grushenka,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya. He began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was wearing his new striped-silk dressing-gown, which Mitya had never seen, and a silk cord with tassels round the waist. A clean, dandified shirt of fine linen with gold studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing-gown. On his head Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage which Alyosha had seen.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He has got himself up,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">His father was standing near the window, apparently lost in thought. Suddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment, and hearing nothing went up to the table, poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanter and drank it off. Then he uttered a deep <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg438"></a> sigh, again stood still a moment, walked carelessly up to the looking-glass on the wall, with his right hand raised the red bandage on his forehead a little, and began examining his bruises and scars, which had not yet disappeared.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's alone,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;in all probability he's alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned suddenly to the window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she's asleep by now,&#8221;</span> he thought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the window. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's looking for her out of the window, so she's not there. Why should he stare out into the dark? He's wild with impatience.&#8221;</span> ... Mitya slipped back at once, and fell to gazing in at the window again. The old man was sitting down at the table, apparently disappointed. At last he put his elbow on the table, and laid his right cheek against his hand. Mitya watched him eagerly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's alone, he's alone!&#8221;</span> he repeated again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If she were here, his face would be different.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Strange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart that she was not here. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's not that she's not here,&#8221;</span> he explained to himself, immediately, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but that I can't tell for certain whether she is or not.&#8221;</span> Mitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment exceptionally clear, that he took in everything to the slightest detail, and missed no point. But a feeling of misery, the misery of uncertainty and indecision, was growing in his heart with every instant. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is she here or not?&#8221;</span> The angry doubt filled his heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he put out his hand and softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked the signal the old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then three times more quickly, the signal that meant <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Grushenka is here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up quickly, ran to the window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow. Fyodor Pavlovitch opened the window and thrust his whole head out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Grushenka, is it you? Is it you?&#8221;</span> he said, in a sort of trembling half-whisper. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where are you, my angel, where are you?&#8221;</span> He was fearfully agitated and breathless.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg439"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He's alone.&#8221;</span> Mitya decided.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where are you?&#8221;</span> cried the old man again; and he thrust his head out farther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all directions, right and left. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come here, I've a little present for you. Come, I'll show you....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He means the three thousand,&#8221;</span> thought Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But where are you? Are you at the door? I'll open it directly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out to the right, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see into the darkness. In another second he would certainly have run out to open the door without waiting for Grushenka's answer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya looked at him from the side without stirring. The old man's profile that he loathed so, his pendent Adam's apple, his hooked nose, his lips that smiled in greedy expectation, were all brightly lighted up by the slanting lamplight falling on the left from the room. A horrible fury of hatred suddenly surged up in Mitya's heart: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There he was, his rival, the man who had tormented him, had ruined his life!&#8221;</span> It was a rush of that sudden, furious, revengeful anger of which he had spoken, as though foreseeing it, to Alyosha, four days ago in the arbor, when, in answer to Alyosha's question, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How can you say you'll kill our father?&#8221;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't know, I don't know,&#8221;</span> he had said then. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps I shall not kill him, perhaps I shall. I'm afraid he'll suddenly be so loathsome to me at that moment. I hate his double chin, his nose, his eyes, his shameless grin. I feel a personal repulsion. That's what I'm afraid of, that's what may be too much for me.&#8221;</span> ... This personal repulsion was growing unendurable. Mitya was beside himself, he suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of his pocket.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr class="c27">
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God was watching over me then,&#8221;</span> Mitya himself said afterwards. At that very moment Grigory waked up on his bed of sickness. Earlier in the evening he had undergone the treatment which Smerdyakov had described to Ivan. He had rubbed himself all over with vodka mixed with a secret, very strong decoction, had drunk what was left of the mixture while his wife repeated a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;certain prayer&#8221;</span> over him, after which he had gone to bed. Marfa Ignatyevna had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to strong drink, slept like the dead beside her husband.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg440"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a moment's reflection, though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his back, he sat up in bed. Then he deliberated again, got up and dressed hurriedly. Perhaps his conscience was uneasy at the thought of sleeping while the house was unguarded <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;in such perilous times.&#8221;</span> Smerdyakov, exhausted by his fit, lay motionless in the next room. Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The stuff's been too much for the woman,&#8221;</span> Grigory thought, glancing at her, and groaning, he went out on the steps. No doubt he only intended to look out from the steps, for he was hardly able to walk, the pain in his back and his right leg was intolerable. But he suddenly remembered that he had not locked the little gate into the garden that evening. He was the most punctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an unchangeable routine, and habits that lasted for years. Limping and writhing with pain he went down the steps and towards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open. Mechanically he stepped into the garden. Perhaps he fancied something, perhaps caught some sound, and, glancing to the left he saw his master's window open. No one was looking out of it then.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's it open for? It's not summer now,&#8221;</span> thought Grigory, and suddenly, at that very instant he caught a glimpse of something extraordinary before him in the garden. Forty paces in front of him a man seemed to be running in the dark, a sort of shadow was moving very fast.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221;</span> cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the pain in his back, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He took a short cut, evidently he knew the garden better; the flying figure went towards the bath-house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence. Grigory followed, not losing sight of him, and ran, forgetting everything. He reached the fence at the very moment the man was climbing over it. Grigory cried out, beside himself, pounced on him, and clutched his leg in his two hands.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Yes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him, it was he, the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;monster,&#8221;</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;parricide.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Parricide!&#8221;</span> the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could hear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as though struck by lightning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg441"></a> In Mitya's hands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in the grass. The pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on the path, in a most conspicuous place. For some seconds he examined the prostrate figure before him. The old man's head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his hand and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly, that he had been awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old man's skull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was flowing horribly; and in a moment Mitya's fingers were drenched with the hot stream. He remembered taking out of his pocket the clean white handkerchief with which he had provided himself for his visit to Madame Hohlakov, and putting it to the old man's head, senselessly trying to wipe the blood from his face and temples. But the handkerchief was instantly soaked with blood.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good heavens! what am I doing it for?&#8221;</span> thought Mitya, suddenly pulling himself together. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I have broken his skull, how can I find out now? And what difference does it make now?&#8221;</span> he added, hopelessly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If I've killed him, I've killed him.... You've come to grief, old man, so there you must lie!&#8221;</span> he said aloud. And suddenly turning to the fence, he vaulted over it into the lane and fell to running&#8212;the handkerchief soaked with blood he held, crushed up in his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it into the back pocket of his coat. He ran headlong, and the few passers-by who met him in the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they had met a man running that night. He flew back again to the widow Morozov's house.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Immediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed to the chief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for Christ's sake, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;not to let the captain in again to-day or to-morrow.&#8221;</span> Nazar Ivanovitch promised, but went upstairs to his mistress who had suddenly sent for him, and meeting his nephew, a boy of twenty, who had recently come from the country, on the way up told him to take his place, but forgot to mention <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the captain.&#8221;</span> Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked. The lad instantly recognized him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him. Opening the gate at once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him with a good-humored smile that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now, you know.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where is she then, Prohor?&#8221;</span> asked Mitya, stopping short.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to Mokroe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What for?&#8221;</span> cried Mitya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That I can't say. To see some officer. Some one invited her and horses were sent to fetch her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.</p>
