<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00036"><span class="c9">Chapter VI. A Laceration In The Cottage</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been before. He had rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what? In a love-affair. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what do I know about it? What can I tell about such things?&#8221;</span> he repeated to himself for the hundredth time, flushing crimson. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, being ashamed would be nothing; shame is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall certainly have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me to reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg214"></a> together?&#8221;</span> Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join their hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Though I acted quite sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,&#8221;</span> he concluded suddenly, and did not even smile at his conclusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Katerina Ivanovna's commission took him to Lake Street, and his brother Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street. Alyosha decided to go to him in any case before going to the captain, though he had a presentiment that he would not find his brother. He suspected that he would intentionally keep out of his way now, but he must find him anyhow. Time was passing: the thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for one minute from the time he set off from the monastery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was one point which interested him particularly about Katerina Ivanovna's commission; when she had mentioned the captain's son, the little schoolboy who had run beside his father crying, the idea had at once struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten his finger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had done to hurt him. Now Alyosha felt practically certain of this, though he could not have said why. Thinking of another subject was a relief, and he resolved to think no more about the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;mischief&#8221;</span> he had done, and not to torture himself with remorse, but to do what he had to do, let come what would. At that thought he was completely comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, he felt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought from his father's, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker, his son, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He hasn't slept here for the last three nights. Maybe he has gone away,&#8221;</span> the old man said in answer to Alyosha's persistent inquiries. Alyosha saw that he was answering in accordance with instructions. When he asked whether he were not at Grushenka's or in hiding at Foma's (Alyosha spoke so freely on purpose), all three looked at him in alarm. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They are fond of him, they are doing their best for him,&#8221;</span> thought Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's good.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little house, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street, and with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary cow. He crossed the yard and found the door opening into the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg215"></a> passage. On the left of the passage lived the old woman of the house with her old daughter. Both seemed to be deaf. In answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last understood that he was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a door across the passage. The captain's lodging turned out to be a simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open the door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew from Katerina Ivanovna's words that the man had a family. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Either they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to open the door. I'd better knock first,&#8221;</span> and he knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an interval of perhaps ten seconds.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who's there?&#8221;</span> shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He found himself in a regular peasant's room. Though it was large, it was cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there were several people in it. On the left was a large Russian stove. From the stove to the window on the left was a string running across the room, and on it there were rags hanging. There was a bedstead against the wall on each side, right and left, covered with knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of four print-covered pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the other there was only one very small pillow. The opposite corner was screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this curtain could be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The rough square table of plain wood had been moved into the middle window. The three windows, which consisted each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes, gave little light, and were close shut, so that the room was not very light and rather stuffy. On the table was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs, a half-eaten piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was sitting on a chair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and yellow, and her sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she was ill. But what struck Alyosha most was the expression in the poor woman's eyes&#8212;a look of surprised inquiry and yet of haughty pride. And while he was talking to her husband, her big brown eyes moved from one speaker to the other with the same haughty <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg216"></a> and questioning expression. Beside her at the window stood a young girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but very neatly dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in. Beside the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a very sad sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;with withered legs,&#8221;</span> as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her crutches stood in the corner close by. The strikingly beautiful and gentle eyes of this poor girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man of forty-five was sitting at the table, finishing the fried eggs. He was spare, small and weakly built. He had reddish hair and a scanty light-colored beard, very much like a wisp of tow (this comparison and the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;a wisp of tow&#8221;</span> flashed at once into Alyosha's mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards). It was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there was no other man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he leapt up from the bench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping his mouth with a ragged napkin, darted up to Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to come to!&#8221;</span> the girl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man spun round instantly towards her and answered her in an excited and breaking voice:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,&#8221;</span> he turned again to Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;what has brought you to&#8212;our retreat?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had seen him. There was something angular, flurried and irritable about him. Though he had obviously just been drinking, he was not drunk. There was extraordinary impudence in his expression, and yet, strange to say, at the same time there was fear. He looked like a man who had long been kept in subjection and had submitted to it, and now had suddenly turned and was trying to assert himself. Or, better still, like a man who wants dreadfully to hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him. In his words and in the intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy humor, at times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting from one tone to another. The question about <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;our retreat&#8221;</span> he had asked as it were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up so close to Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was dressed in a very shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg217"></a> checked trousers of an extremely light color, long out of fashion, and of very thin material. They were so crumpled and so short that he looked as though he had grown out of them like a boy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am Alexey Karamazov,&#8221;</span> Alyosha began in reply.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I quite understand that, sir,&#8221;</span> the gentleman snapped out at once to assure him that he knew who he was already. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am Captain Snegiryov, sir, but I am still desirous to know precisely what has led you&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, I've come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with you&#8212;if only you allow me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That's what they used to say in the old comedies, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;kindly be seated,&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span> and with a rapid gesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden chair, not upholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of the room; then, taking another similar chair for himself, he sat down facing Alyosha, so close to him that their knees almost touched.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian infantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though I might not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my life I've learnt to say <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;sir.&#8217;</span> It's a word you use when you've come down in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's very true,&#8221;</span> smiled Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But is it used involuntarily or on purpose?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;As God's above, it's involuntary, and I usen't to use it! I didn't use the word <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;sir&#8217;</span> all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water I began to say <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;sir.&#8217;</span> It's the work of a higher power. I see you are interested in contemporary questions, but how can I have excited your curiosity, living as I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise of hospitality?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've come&#8212;about that business.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;About what business?&#8221;</span> the captain interrupted impatiently.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,&#8221;</span> Alyosha blurted out awkwardly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What meeting, sir? You don't mean that meeting? About my <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;wisp of tow,&#8217;</span> then?&#8221;</span> He moved closer so that his knees positively knocked against Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed like a thread.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What wisp of tow?&#8221;</span> muttered Alyosha.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg218"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is come to complain of me, father!&#8221;</span> cried a voice familiar to Alyosha&#8212;the voice of the schoolboy&#8212;from behind the curtain. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I bit his finger just now.&#8221;</span> The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner under the ikons. The boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded quilt. He was evidently unwell, and, judging by his glittering eyes, he was in a fever. He looked at Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he was at home and could not be touched.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What! Did he bite your finger?&#8221;</span> The captain jumped up from his chair. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Was it your finger he bit?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There were six of them against him alone. I went up to him, and he threw a stone at me and then another at my head. I asked him what I had done to him. And then he rushed at me and bit my finger badly, I don't know why.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll thrash him, sir, at once&#8212;this minute!&#8221;</span> The captain jumped up from his seat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ... I don't want him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And do you suppose I'd thrash him? That I'd take my Ilusha and thrash him before you for your satisfaction? Would you like it done at once, sir?&#8221;</span> said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha, as though he were going to attack him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am sorry about your finger, sir; but instead of thrashing Ilusha, would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to satisfy your just wrath? I should think four fingers would be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You won't ask for the fifth one too?&#8221;</span> He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Every feature in his face was twitching and working; he looked extremely defiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I think I understand it all now,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully, still keeping his seat. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So your boy is a good boy, he loves his father, and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant.... Now I understand it,&#8221;</span> he repeated thoughtfully. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets his action, I know that, and if only it is possible for him to come to you, or better still, to meet you in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg219"></a> that same place, he will ask your forgiveness before every one&#8212;if you wish it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;After pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my forgiveness? And he thinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesn't he?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in any way you like.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in that very tavern&#8212;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;The Metropolis&#8217;</span> it's called&#8212;or in the market-place, he would do it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, he would even go down on his knees.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You've pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears and pierced me to the heart! I am only too sensible of your brother's generosity. Allow me to introduce my family, my two daughters and my son&#8212;my litter. If I die, who will care for them, and while I live who but they will care for a wretch like me? That's a great thing the Lord has ordained for every man of my sort, sir. For there must be some one able to love even a man like me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, that's perfectly true!&#8221;</span> exclaimed Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and you put us to shame!&#8221;</span> cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning to her father with a disdainful and contemptuous air.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Wait a little, Varvara!&#8221;</span> cried her father, speaking peremptorily but looking at her quite approvingly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's her character,&#8221;</span> he said, addressing Alyosha again.</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="tei tei-q c25"><span class="c20">&#8220;</span><span class="c20">And in all nature there was naught</span></span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">That could find favor in his eyes&#8212;</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">or rather in the feminine: that could find favor in her eyes. But now let me present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled, she is forty-three; she can move, but very little. She is of humble origin. Arina Petrovna, compose your countenance. This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.&#8221;</span> He took him by the hand and with unexpected force pulled him up. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You must stand up to be introduced to a lady. It's not the Karamazov, mamma, who ... h'm ... etcetera, but his brother, radiant with modest virtues. Come, Arina Petrovna, come, mamma, first your hand to be kissed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And he kissed his wife's hand respectfully and even tenderly. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg220"></a> girl at the window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an expression of extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of the woman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,&#8221;</span> she said.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin,&#8221;</span> he whispered again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of Tchernomazov.... Sit down. Why has he pulled you up? He calls me crippled, but I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels, and I am shriveled up myself. Once I used to be so fat, but now it's as though I had swallowed a needle.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We are of humble origin,&#8221;</span> the captain muttered again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, father, father!&#8221;</span> the hunchback girl, who had till then been silent on her chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Buffoon!&#8221;</span> blurted out the girl at the window.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you heard our news?&#8221;</span> said the mother, pointing at her daughters. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we have music again. When we were with the army, we used to have many such guests. I don't mean to make any comparisons; every one to their taste. The deacon's wife used to come then and say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart, but Nastasya Petrovna,&#8217;</span> she would say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;is of the brood of hell.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Well,&#8217;</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;that's a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;And you want keeping in your place,&#8217;</span> says she. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You black sword,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;who asked you to teach me?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;But my breath,&#8217;</span> says she, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;is clean, and yours is unclean.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You ask all the officers whether my breath is unclean.&#8217;</span> And ever since then I had it in my mind. Not long ago I was sitting here as I am now, when I saw that very general come in who came here for Easter, and I asked him: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Your Excellency,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;can a lady's breath be unpleasant?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes,&#8217;</span> he answered; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;you ought to open a window-pane or open the door, for the air is not fresh here.&#8217;</span> And they all go on like that! And what is my breath to them? The dead smell worse still! <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I won't spoil the air,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll order some slippers and go away.&#8217;</span> My darlings, don't blame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how is it I can't please you? There's only Ilusha who comes home from school and loves me. Yesterday he brought me an apple. Forgive your own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg221"></a> mother&#8212;forgive a poor lonely creature! Why has my breath become unpleasant to you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed down her cheeks. The captain rushed up to her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Every one loves you, every one adores you.&#8221;</span> He began kissing both her hands again and tenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin, he began wiping away her tears. Alyosha fancied that he too had tears in his eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There, you see, you hear?&#8221;</span> he turned with a sort of fury to Alyosha, pointing to the poor imbecile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see and hear,&#8221;</span> muttered Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Father, father, how can you&#8212;with him! Let him alone!&#8221;</span> cried the boy, sitting up in his bed and gazing at his father with glowing eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never lead to anything!&#8221;</span> shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with passion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I'll make haste to satisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and I'll put on mine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you in earnest, but not within these walls. This girl sitting here is my daughter Nina; I forgot to introduce her to you. She is a heavenly angel incarnate ... who has flown down to us mortals,... if you can understand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!&#8221;</span> Varvara went on indignantly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool just now, she is a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good reason to call me so. Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make an end.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And, snatching Alyosha's hand, he drew him out of the room into the street.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense of the word. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your kind interest.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg222"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I too have something important to say to you,&#8221;</span> observed Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;only I don't know how to begin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be sure you must have business with me. You would never have looked in upon me without some object. Unless you come simply to complain of the boy, and that's hardly likely. And, by the way, about the boy: I could not explain to you in there, but here I will describe that scene to you. My tow was thicker a week ago&#8212;I mean my beard. That's the nickname they give to my beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard, I'd done nothing, he was in a towering rage and happened to come upon me. He dragged me out of the tavern into the market-place; at that moment the boys were coming out of school, and with them Ilusha. As soon as he saw me in such a state he rushed up to me. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;father!&#8217;</span> He caught hold of me, hugged me, tried to pull me away, crying to my assailant, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Let go, let go, it's my father, forgive him!&#8217;</span>&#8212;yes, he actually cried <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;forgive him.&#8217;</span> He clutched at that hand, that very hand, in his little hands and kissed it.... I remember his little face at that moment, I haven't forgotten it and I never shall!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I swear,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that my brother will express his most deep and sincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in that same market-place.... I'll make him or he is no brother of mine!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Aha, then it's only a suggestion! And it does not come from him but simply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You should have said so. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your brother's highly chivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give expression to it at the time. He left off dragging me by my beard and released me: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You are an officer,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and I am an officer, if you can find a decent man to be your second send me your challenge. I will give satisfaction, though you are a scoundrel.&#8217;</span> That's what he said. A chivalrous spirit indeed! I retired with Ilusha, and that scene is a family record imprinted for ever on Ilusha's soul. No, it's not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen. Judge for yourself. You've just been in our mansion, what did you see there? Three ladies, one a cripple and weak-minded, another a cripple and hunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever. She is a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg223"></a> student, dying to get back to Petersburg, to work for the emancipation of the Russian woman on the banks of the Neva. I won't speak of Ilusha, he is only nine. I am alone in the world, and if I die, what will become of all of them? I simply ask you that. And if I challenge him and he kills me on the spot, what then? What will become of them? And worse still, if he doesn't kill me but only cripples me: I couldn't work, but I should still be a mouth to feed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I take Ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets? That's what it means for me to challenge him to a duel. It's silly talk and nothing else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet in the middle of the market-place,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha again, with glowing eyes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I did think of prosecuting him,&#8221;</span> the captain went on, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;but look in our code, could I get much compensation for a personal injury? And then Agrafena Alexandrovna<a href="the-brothers-karamazov-60.html#note_3" id="noteref_3" class="dlinternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c24">3</span></span></a> sent for me and shouted at me: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Don't dare to dream of it! If you proceed against him, I'll publish it to all the world that he beat you for your dishonesty, and then you will be prosecuted.&#8217;</span> I call God to witness whose was the dishonesty and by whose commands I acted, wasn't it by her own and Fyodor Pavlovitch's? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;And what's more,&#8217;</span> she went on, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I'll dismiss you for good and you'll never earn another penny from me. I'll speak to my merchant too&#8217;</span> (that's what she calls her old man) <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;and he will dismiss you!&#8217;</span> And if he dismisses me, what can I earn then from any one? Those two are all I have to look to, for your Fyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over employing me, for another reason, but he means to make use of papers I've signed to go to law against me. And so I kept quiet, and you have seen our retreat. But now let me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger much? I didn't like to go into it in our mansion before him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was avenging you on me as a Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen how he was throwing stones at his school-fellows! It's very dangerous. They might kill him. They are children and stupid. A stone may be thrown and break somebody's head.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's just what has happened. He has been bruised by a stone <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg224"></a> to-day. Not on the head but on the chest, just above the heart. He came home crying and groaning and now he is ill.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you know he attacks them first. He is bitter against them on your account. They say he stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with a pen-knife not long ago.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've heard about that too, it's dangerous. Krassotkin is an official here, we may hear more about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I would advise you,&#8221;</span> Alyosha went on warmly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;not to send him to school at all for a time till he is calmer ... and his anger is passed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Anger!&#8221;</span> the captain repeated, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that's just what it is. He is a little creature, but it's a mighty anger. You don't know all, sir. Let me tell you more. Since that incident all the boys have been teasing him about the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;wisp of tow.&#8217;</span> Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually they are angels, but together, especially in schools, they are often merciless. Their teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in Ilusha. An ordinary boy, a weak son, would have submitted, have felt ashamed of his father, sir, but he stood up for his father against them all. For his father and for truth and justice. For what he suffered when he kissed your brother's hand and cried to him <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Forgive father, forgive him,&#8217;</span>&#8212;that only God knows&#8212;and I, his father. For our children&#8212;not your children, but ours&#8212;the children of the poor gentlemen looked down upon by every one&#8212;know what justice means, sir, even at nine years old. How should the rich know? They don't explore such depths once in their lives. But at that moment in the square when he kissed his hand, at that moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justice means. That truth entered into him and crushed him for ever, sir,&#8221;</span> the captain said hotly again with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his right fist against his left palm as though he wanted to show how <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the truth&#8221;</span> crushed Ilusha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and was delirious all night. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but I noticed he kept watching me from the corner, though he turned to the window and pretended to be learning his lessons. But I could see his mind was not on his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget my troubles, sinful man as I am, and I don't remember much. Mamma began crying, too&#8212;I am very fond of mamma&#8212;well, I spent my last penny drowning my troubles. Don't despise me for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg225"></a> that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The best men amongst us are the greatest drunkards. I lay down and I don't remember about Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering at him at school. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Wisp of tow,&#8217;</span> they shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;your father was pulled out of the tavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged forgiveness.&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;On the third day when he came back from school, I saw he looked pale and wretched. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What is it?&#8217;</span> I asked. He wouldn't answer. Well, there's no talking in our mansion without mamma and the girls taking part in it. What's more, the girls had heard about it the very first day. Varvara had begun snarling. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You fools and buffoons, can you ever do anything rational?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Quite so,&#8217;</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;can we ever do anything rational?&#8217;</span> For the time I turned it off like that. So in the evening I took the boy out for a walk, for you must know we go for a walk every evening, always the same way, along which we are going now&#8212;from our gate to that great stone which lies alone in the road under the hurdle, which marks the beginning of the town pasture. A beautiful and lonely spot, sir. Ilusha and I walked along hand in hand as usual. He has a little hand, his fingers are thin and cold&#8212;he suffers with his chest, you know. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;father!&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Well?&#8217;</span> said I. I saw his eyes flashing. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father, how he treated you then!&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It can't be helped, Ilusha,&#8217;</span> I said. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Don't forgive him, father, don't forgive him! At school they say that he has paid you ten roubles for it.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;No, Ilusha,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I would not take money from him for anything.&#8217;</span> Then he began trembling all over, took my hand in both his and kissed it again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;father, challenge him to a duel, at school they say you are a coward and won't challenge him, and that you'll accept ten roubles from him.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I can't challenge him to a duel, Ilusha,&#8217;</span> I answered. And I told briefly what I've just told you. He listened. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;anyway don't forgive it. When I grow up I'll call him out myself and kill him.&#8217;</span> His eyes shone and glowed. And of course I am his father, and I had to put in a word: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's a sin to kill,&#8217;</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;even in a duel.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;when I grow up, I'll knock him down, knock the sword out of his hand, I'll fall on him, wave my sword over him and say: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I could kill you, but I forgive you, so there!&#8221;</span>&#8201;&#8217;</span> You see what the workings of his little mind have been during these two days; he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg226"></a> must have been planning that vengeance all day, and raving about it at night.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he began to come home from school badly beaten, I found out about it the day before yesterday, and you are right, I won't send him to that school any more. I heard that he was standing up against all the class alone and defying them all, that his heart was full of resentment, of bitterness&#8212;I was alarmed about him. We went for another walk. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> he asked, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;are the rich people stronger than any one else on earth?&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes, Ilusha,&#8217;</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;there are no people on earth stronger than the rich.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I will get rich, I will become an officer and conquer everybody. The Tsar will reward me, I will come back here and then no one will dare&#8212;&#8217;</span> Then he was silent and his lips still kept trembling. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;what a horrid town this is.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes, Ilusha,&#8217;</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;it isn't a very nice town.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father, let us move into another town, a nice one,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;where people don't know about us.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;We will move, we will, Ilusha,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;only I must save up for it.&#8217;</span> I was glad to be able to turn his mind from painful thoughts, and we began to dream of how we would move to another town, how we would buy a horse and cart. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;We will put mamma and your sisters inside, we will cover them up and we'll walk, you shall have a lift now and then, and I'll walk beside, for we must take care of our horse, we can't all ride. That's how we'll go.&#8217;</span> He was enchanted at that, most of all at the thought of having a horse and driving him. For of course a Russian boy is born among horses. We chattered a long while. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted his mind and comforted him.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That was the day before yesterday, in the evening, but last night everything was changed. He had gone to school in the morning, he came back depressed, terribly depressed. In the evening I took him by the hand and we went for a walk; he would not talk. There was a wind blowing and no sun, and a feeling of autumn; twilight was coming on. We walked along, both of us depressed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Well, my boy,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;how about our setting off on our travels?&#8217;</span> I thought I might bring him back to our talk of the day before. He didn't answer, but I felt his fingers trembling in my hand. Ah, I thought, it's a bad job; there's something fresh. We had reached the stone where we are now. I sat down on the stone. And <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg227"></a> in the air there were lots of kites flapping and whirling. There were as many as thirty in sight. Of course, it's just the season for the kites. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Look, Ilusha,&#8217;</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;it's time we got out our last year's kite again. I'll mend it, where have you put it away?&#8217;</span> My boy made no answer. He looked away and turned sideways to me. And then a gust of wind blew up the sand. He suddenly fell on me, threw both his little arms round my neck and held me tight. You know, when children are silent and proud, and try to keep back their tears when they are in great trouble and suddenly break down, their tears fall in streams. With those warm streams of tears, he suddenly wetted my face. He sobbed and shook as though he were in convulsions, and squeezed up against me as I sat on the stone. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Father,&#8217;</span> he kept crying, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;dear father, how he insulted you!&#8217;</span> And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other's arms. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Ilusha,&#8217;</span> I said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Ilusha darling.&#8217;</span> No one saw us then. God alone saw us, I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won't thrash my boy for your satisfaction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyosha felt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one else in his, Alyosha's place, the man would not have spoken so openly and would not have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart was trembling on the verge of tears.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, how I would like to make friends with your boy!&#8221;</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If you could arrange it&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Certainly, sir,&#8221;</span> muttered the captain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But now listen to something quite different!&#8221;</span> Alyosha went on. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I have a message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his betrothed, too, a noble-hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I have a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for hearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate position, she commissioned me at once&#8212;just now&#8212;to bring you this help from her&#8212;but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her. Nor from me, his brother, nor from any one else, but from her, only from her! She entreats you to accept her help.... You have both been insulted by the same man. She thought of you only when she had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg228"></a> just received a similar insult from him&#8212;similar in its cruelty, I mean. She comes like a sister to help a brother in misfortune.... She told me to persuade you to take these two hundred roubles from her, as from a sister, knowing that you are in such need. No one will know of it, it can give rise to no unjust slander. There are the two hundred roubles, and I swear you must take them unless&#8212;unless all men are to be enemies on earth! But there are brothers even on earth.... You have a generous heart ... you must see that, you must,&#8221;</span> and Alyosha held out two new rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They were both standing at the time by the great stone close to the fence, and there was no one near. The notes seemed to produce a tremendous impression on the captain. He started, but at first only from astonishment. Such an outcome of their conversation was the last thing he expected. Nothing could have been farther from his dreams than help from any one&#8212;and such a sum!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He took the notes, and for a minute he was almost unable to answer, quite a new expression came into his face.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That for me? So much money&#8212;two hundred roubles! Good heavens! Why, I haven't seen so much money for the last four years! Mercy on us! And she says she is a sister.... And is that the truth?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I swear that all I told you is the truth,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The captain flushed red.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shan't be behaving like a scoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I shan't be a scoundrel? No, Alexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen,&#8221;</span> he hurried, touching Alyosha with both his hands. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are persuading me to take it, saying that it's a sister sends it, but inwardly, in your heart won't you feel contempt for me if I take it, eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, no, on my salvation I swear I shan't! And no one will ever know but me&#8212;I, you and she, and one other lady, her great friend.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Never mind the lady! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment like this you must listen, for you can't understand what these two hundred roubles mean to me now.&#8221;</span> The poor fellow went on rising gradually into a sort of incoherent, almost wild enthusiasm. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg229"></a> He was thrown off his balance and talked extremely fast, as though afraid he would not be allowed to say all he had to say.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Besides its being honestly acquired from a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;sister,&#8217;</span> so highly respected and revered, do you know that now I can look after mamma and Nina, my hunchback angel daughter? Doctor Herzenstube came to me in the kindness of his heart and was examining them both for a whole hour. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I can make nothing of it,&#8217;</span> said he, but he prescribed a mineral water which is kept at a chemist's here. He said it would be sure to do her good, and he ordered baths, too, with some medicine in them. The mineral water costs thirty copecks, and she'd need to drink forty bottles perhaps; so I took the prescription and laid it on the shelf under the ikons, and there it lies. And he ordered hot baths for Nina with something dissolved in them, morning and evening. But how can we carry out such a cure in our mansion, without servants, without help, without a bath, and without water? Nina is rheumatic all over, I don't think I told you that. All her right side aches at night, she is in agony, and, would you believe it, the angel bears it without groaning for fear of waking us. We eat what we can get, and she'll only take the leavings, what you'd scarcely give to a dog. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am not worth it, I am taking it from you, I am a burden on you,&#8217;</span> that's what her angel eyes try to express. We wait on her, but she doesn't like it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am a useless cripple, no good to any one.&#8217;</span> As though she were not worth it, when she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness. Without her, without her gentle word it would be hell among us! She softens even Varvara. And don't judge Varvara harshly either, she is an angel too, she, too, has suffered wrong. She came to us for the summer, and she brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up, to go back with to Petersburg in September, that is now. But we took her money and lived on it, so now she has nothing to go back with. Though indeed she couldn't go back, for she has to work for us like a slave. She is like an overdriven horse with all of us on her back. She waits on us all, mends and washes, sweeps the floor, puts mamma to bed. And mamma is capricious and tearful and insane! And now I can get a servant with this money, you understand, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I can get medicines for the dear creatures, I can send my student to Petersburg, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg230"></a> I can buy beef, I can feed them properly. Good Lord, but it's a dream!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha was delighted that he had brought him such happiness and that the poor fellow had consented to be made happy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay,&#8221;</span> the captain began to talk with frenzied rapidity, carried away by a new day-dream. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know that Ilusha and I will perhaps really carry out our dream. We will buy a horse and cart, a black horse, he insists on its being black, and we will set off as we pretended the other day. I have an old friend, a lawyer in K. province, and I heard through a trustworthy man that if I were to go he'd give me a place as clerk in his office, so, who knows, maybe he would. So I'd just put mamma and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha could drive, and I'd walk, I'd walk.... Why, if I only succeed in getting one debt paid that's owing me, I should have perhaps enough for that too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There would be enough!&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Katerina Ivanovna will send you as much more as you need, and you know, I have money too, take what you want, as you would from a brother, from a friend, you can give it back later.... (You'll get rich, you'll get rich!) And you know you couldn't have a better idea than to move to another province! It would be the saving of you, especially of your boy&#8212;and you ought to go quickly, before the winter, before the cold. You must write to us when you are there, and we will always be brothers.... No, it's not a dream!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha could have hugged him, he was so pleased. But glancing at him he stopped short. The man was standing with his neck outstretched and his lips protruding, with a pale and frenzied face. His lips were moving as though trying to articulate something; no sound came, but still his lips moved. It was uncanny.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha, startled.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey Fyodorovitch ... I ... you,&#8221;</span> muttered the captain, faltering, looking at him with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air of desperate resolution. At the same time there was a sort of grin on his lips. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I ... you, sir ... wouldn't you like me to show you a little trick I know?&#8221;</span> he murmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid whisper, his voice no longer faltering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What trick?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A pretty trick,&#8221;</span> whispered the captain. His mouth was twisted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg231"></a> on the left side, his left eye was screwed up. He still stared at Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What is the matter? What trick?&#8221;</span> Alyosha cried, now thoroughly alarmed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, look,&#8221;</span> squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him the two notes which he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefinger during the conversation, he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed them tight in his right hand. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you see, do you see?&#8221;</span> he shrieked, pale and infuriated. And suddenly flinging up his hand, he threw the crumpled notes on the sand. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you see?&#8221;</span> he shrieked again, pointing to them. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Look there!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel, gasping and exclaiming as he did so:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your money!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Suddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha, and his whole figure expressed unutterable pride.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honor,&#8221;</span> he cried, raising his arm in the air. Then he turned quickly and began to run; but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round and kissed his hand to Alyosha. He ran another five paces and then turned round for the last time. This time his face was not contorted with laughter, but quivering all over with tears. In a tearful, faltering, sobbing voice he cried:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What should I say to my boy if I took money from you for our shame?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And then he ran on without turning. Alyosha looked after him, inexpressibly grieved. Oh, he saw that till the very last moment the man had not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes. He did not turn back. Alyosha knew he would not. He would not follow him and call him back, he knew why. When he was out of sight, Alyosha picked up the two notes. They were very much crushed and crumpled, and had been pressed into the sand, but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyosha unfolded them and smoothed them out. After smoothing them out, he folded them up, put them in his pocket and went to Katerina Ivanovna to report on the success of her commission.</p>
