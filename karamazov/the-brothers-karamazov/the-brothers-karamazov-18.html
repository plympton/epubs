<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place shut off by a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the room. It was the first room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall. Waiters were continually darting to and fro in it. The only customer in the room was an old retired military man drinking tea in a corner. But there was the usual bustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for the waiters, the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the drone of the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this tavern and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, he reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was not there.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Shall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don't live on tea alone, I suppose,&#8221;</span> cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got hold of Alyosha. He had finished dinner and was drinking tea.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha gayly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you used to love cherry jam when you were little?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were eleven, I was nearly fifteen. There's such a difference between fifteen and eleven that brothers are never companions at those ages. I don't know whether I was fond of you even. When I went away to Moscow for the first few years I never thought of you at all. Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, we only met once somewhere, I believe. And now I've been here more than three months, and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other. To-morrow I am going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could see you to say good-by and just then you passed.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg251"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Were you very anxious to see me, then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you to know me. And then to say good-by. I believe it's always best to get to know people just before leaving them. I've noticed how you've been looking at me these three months. There has been a continual look of expectation in your eyes, and I can't endure that. That's how it is I've kept away from you. But in the end I have learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, I thought. Though I am laughing, I am serious. You do stand firm, don't you? I like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by, even if they are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes ceased to annoy me, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant eyes. You seem to love me for some reason, Alyosha?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you&#8212;Ivan is a tomb! I say of you, Ivan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But I understand something in you, and I did not understand it till this morning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's that?&#8221;</span> laughed Ivan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You won't be angry?&#8221;</span> Alyosha laughed too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That you are just as young as other young men of three and twenty, that you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in fact! Now, have I insulted you dreadfully?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,&#8221;</span> cried Ivan, warmly and good-humoredly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Would you believe it that ever since that scene with her, I have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness, and just as though you guessed that, you begin about it. Do you know I've been sitting here thinking to myself: that if I didn't believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were convinced in fact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden chaos, if I were struck by every horror of man's disillusionment&#8212;still I should want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn away from it till I had drained it! At thirty, though, I shall be sure to leave the cup, even if I've not emptied it, and turn away&#8212;where I don't know. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph over everything&#8212;every disillusionment, every disgust with life. I've asked myself many times whether there is in the world <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg252"></a> any despair that would overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and I've come to the conclusion that there isn't, that is till I am thirty, and then I shall lose it of myself, I fancy. Some driveling consumptive moralists&#8212;and poets especially&#8212;often call that thirst for life base. It's a feature of the Karamazovs, it's true, that thirst for life regardless of everything; you have it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal force on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by men, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old habit one's heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for you, eat it, it will do you good. It's first-rate soup, they know how to make it here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here. And yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but it's a most precious graveyard, that's what it is! Precious are the dead that lie there, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, of such passionate faith in their work, their truth, their struggle and their science, that I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and weep over them; though I'm convinced in my heart that it's long been nothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but simply because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in my emotion. I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky&#8212;that's all it is. It's not a matter of intellect or logic, it's loving with one's inside, with one's stomach. One loves the first strength of one's youth. Do you understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?&#8221;</span> Ivan laughed suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one's inside, with one's stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully glad that you have such a longing for life,&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I think every one should love life above everything in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Love life more than the meaning of it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be regardless of logic, and it's only then one will understand the meaning of it. I have thought so a long time. Half your work is done, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg253"></a> Ivan, you love life, now you've only to try to do the second half and you are saved.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what does your second half mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died after all. Come, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">professions de foi</span></span> from such&#8212;novices. You are a steadfast person, Alexey. Is it true that you mean to leave the monastery?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, my elder sends me out into the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet before I am thirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. Father doesn't want to turn aside from his cup till he is seventy, he dreams of hanging on to eighty in fact, so he says. He means it only too seriously, though he is a buffoon. He stands on a firm rock, too, he stands on his sensuality&#8212;though after we are thirty, indeed, there may be nothing else to stand on.... But to hang on to seventy is nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;a shadow of nobility&#8217;</span> by deceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to-day?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, but I saw Smerdyakov,&#8221;</span> and Alyosha rapidly, though minutely, described his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began listening anxiously and questioned him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,&#8221;</span> added Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you frowning on Smerdyakov's account?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but now there's no need,&#8221;</span> said Ivan reluctantly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But are you really going so soon, brother?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What of Dmitri and father? how will it end?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha anxiously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri's keeper?&#8221;</span> Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Cain's answer about his murdered brother, wasn't it? Perhaps that's what you're thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can't stay here to be their keeper, can I? I've finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I've been trying to steal his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg254"></a> beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months? Nonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished it just now, you were witness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;At Katerina Ivanovna's?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, and I've released myself once for all. And after all, what have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn't come in. I had my own business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding between us. I didn't ask him to do it, but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It's all too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It's been going on nearly six months, and all at once I've thrown it off. I could never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I wanted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are speaking of your love, Ivan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I worried myself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over her ... and all at once it's collapsed! I spoke this morning with inspiration, but I went away and roared with laughter. Would you believe it? Yes, it's the literal truth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You seem very merry about it now,&#8221;</span> observed Alyosha, looking into his face, which had suddenly grown brighter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But how could I tell that I didn't care for her a bit! Ha ha! It appears after all I didn't. And yet how she attracted me! How attractive she was just now when I made my speech! And do you know she attracts me awfully even now, yet how easy it is to leave her. Do you think I am boasting?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, only perhaps it wasn't love.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha,&#8221;</span> laughed Ivan, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;don't make reflections about love, it's unseemly for you. How you rushed into the discussion this morning! I've forgotten to kiss you for it.... But how she tormented me! It certainly was sitting by a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;laceration.&#8217;</span> Ah, she knew how I loved her! She loved me and not Dmitri,&#8221;</span> Ivan insisted gayly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Her feeling for Dmitri was simply a self-laceration. All I told her just now was perfectly true, but the worst of it is, it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find out that she doesn't care for Dmitri, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg255"></a> and loves me whom she torments, and perhaps she may never find it out at all, in spite of her lesson to-day. Well, it's better so; I can simply go away for good. By the way, how is she now? What happened after I departed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he heard, unconscious and delirious.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Isn't Madame Hohlakov laying it on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don't matter. God gave woman hysterics as a relief. I won't go to her at all. Why push myself forward again?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you told her that she had never cared for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let us drink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, brother, we had better not drink,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Besides I feel somehow depressed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, you've been depressed a long time, I've noticed it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Morning? I didn't say I should go in the morning.... But perhaps it may be the morning. Would you believe it, I dined here to-day only to avoid dining with the old man, I loathe him so. I should have left long ago, so far as he is concerned. But why are you so worried about my going away? We've plenty of time before I go, an eternity!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If you are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what does it matter to us?&#8221;</span> laughed Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We've time enough for our talk, for what brought us here. Why do you look so surprised? Answer: why have we met here? To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old man and Dmitri? of foreign travel? of the fatal position of Russia? Of the Emperor Napoleon? Is that it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Then you know what for. It's different for other people; but we in our green youth have to settle the eternal questions first of all. That's what we care about. Young Russia is talking about nothing but the eternal questions now. Just when the old folks are all taken up with practical questions. Why have you been looking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg256"></a> at me in expectation for the last three months? To ask me, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What do you believe, or don't you believe at all?&#8217;</span> That's what your eyes have been meaning for these three months, haven't they?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221;</span> smiled Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are not laughing at me, now, Ivan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Me laughing! I don't want to wound my little brother who has been watching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha, look straight at me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you are, only not a novice. And what have Russian boys been doing up till now, some of them, I mean? In this stinking tavern, for instance, here, they meet and sit down in a corner. They've never met in their lives before and, when they go out of the tavern, they won't meet again for forty years. And what do they talk about in that momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions, of the existence of God and immortality. And those who do not believe in God talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation of all humanity on a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same, they're the same questions turned inside out. And masses, masses of the most original Russian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal questions! Isn't it so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, for real Russians the questions of God's existence and of immortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out, come first and foremost, of course, and so they should,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha, still watching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, Alyosha, it's sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all, but anything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time one can hardly imagine. But there's one Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfully fond of.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How nicely you put that in!&#8221;</span> Alyosha laughed suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of God, eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Begin where you like. You declared yesterday at father's that there was no God.&#8221;</span> Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and I saw your eyes glow. But now I've no objection to discussing with you, and I say so very seriously. I want to be friends with you, Alyosha, for I have no friends and want to try it. Well, only fancy, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg257"></a> perhaps I too accept God,&#8221;</span> laughed Ivan; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that's a surprise for you, isn't it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, of course, if you are not joking now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Joking? I was told at the elder's yesterday that I was joking. You know, dear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who declared that, if there were no God, he would have to be invented. <span class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span class="c19">S'il n'existait pas Dieu, il faudrait l'inventer.</span></span> And man has actually invented God. And what's strange, what would be marvelous, is not that God should really exist; the marvel is that such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God, could enter the head of such a savage, vicious beast as man. So holy it is, so touching, so wise and so great a credit it does to man. As for me, I've long resolved not to think whether man created God or God man. And I won't go through all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that subject, all derived from European hypotheses; for what's a hypothesis there, is an axiom with the Russian boy, and not only with the boys but with their teachers too, for our Russian professors are often just the same boys themselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses. For what are we aiming at now? I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature, that is what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope, that's it, isn't it? And therefore I tell you that I accept God simply. But you must note this: if God exists and if He really did create the world, then, as we all know, He created it according to the geometry of Euclid and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions in space. Yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers, and even some of the most distinguished, who doubt whether the whole universe, or to speak more widely the whole of being, was only created in Euclid's geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid can never meet on earth, may meet somewhere in infinity. I have come to the conclusion that, since I can't understand even that, I can't expect to understand about God. I acknowledge humbly that I have no faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg258"></a> are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what's more, I accept His wisdom, His purpose&#8212;which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving, and Which Itself was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;with God,&#8217;</span> and Which Itself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity. There are all sorts of phrases for it. I seem to be on the right path, don't I? Yet would you believe it, in the final result I don't accept this world of God's, and, although I know it exists, I don't accept it at all. It's not that I don't accept God, you must understand, it's the world created by Him I don't and cannot accept. Let me make it plain. I believe like a child that suffering will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidian mind of man, that in the world's finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, something so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity, of all the blood they've shed; that it will make it not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with men&#8212;but though all that may come to pass, I don't accept it. I won't accept it. Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I shall see it and say that they've met, but still I won't accept it. That's what's at the root of me, Alyosha; that's my creed. I am in earnest in what I say. I began our talk as stupidly as I could on purpose, but I've led up to my confession, for that's all you want. You didn't want to hear about God, but only to know what the brother you love lives by. And so I've told you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And why did you begin <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;as stupidly as you could&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha, looking dreamily at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations on such subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly. And secondly, the stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The stupider one is, the clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg259"></a> while intelligence wriggles and hides itself. Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity is honest and straightforward. I've led the conversation to my despair, and the more stupidly I have presented it, the better for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You will explain why you don't accept the world?&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be sure I will, it's not a secret, that's what I've been leading up to. Dear little brother, I don't want to corrupt you or to turn you from your stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.&#8221;</span> Ivan smiled suddenly quite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had never seen such a smile on his face before.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00042"><span class="c9">Chapter IV. Rebellion</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I must make you one confession,&#8221;</span> Ivan began. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I could never understand how one can love one's neighbors. It's just one's neighbors, to my mind, that one can't love, though one might love those at a distance. I once read somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry, frozen beggar came to him, he took him into his bed, held him in his arms, and began breathing into his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some awful disease. I am convinced that he did that from <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;self-laceration,&#8217;</span> from the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed by duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to love a man, he must be hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,&#8221;</span> observed Alyosha; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;he, too, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practiced in love, from loving him. But yet there's a great deal of love in mankind, and almost Christ-like love. I know that myself, Ivan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can't understand it, and the innumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is, whether that's due to men's bad qualities or whether it's inherent in their nature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men is a miracle impossible on earth. He was God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for instance, suffer intensely. Another can never know <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg260"></a> how much I suffer, because he is another and not I. And what's more, a man is rarely ready to admit another's suffering (as though it were a distinction). Why won't he admit it, do you think? Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I once trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering; degrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me&#8212;hunger, for instance&#8212;my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higher suffering&#8212;for an idea, for instance&#8212;he will very rarely admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancies a man should have who suffers for an idea. And so he deprives me instantly of his favor, and not at all from badness of heart. Beggars, especially genteel beggars, ought never to show themselves, but to ask for charity through the newspapers. One can love one's neighbors in the abstract, or even at a distance, but at close quarters it's almost impossible. If it were as on the stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear silken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then one might like looking at them. But even then we should not love them. But enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view. I meant to speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had better confine ourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would be. Still we'd better keep to the children, though it does weaken my case. But, in the first place, children can be loved even at close quarters, even when they are dirty, even when they are ugly (I fancy, though, children never are ugly). The second reason why I won't speak of grown-up people is that, besides being disgusting and unworthy of love, they have a compensation&#8212;they've eaten the apple and know good and evil, and they have become <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;like gods.&#8217;</span> They go on eating it still. But the children haven't eaten anything, and are so far innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and you will understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too, suffer horribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers' sins, they must be punished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that reasoning is of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on earth. The innocent must not suffer for another's sins, and especially such innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fond of children, too. And observe, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg261"></a> cruel people, the violent, the rapacious, the Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of children. Children while they are quite little&#8212;up to seven, for instance&#8212;are so remote from grown-up people; they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species. I knew a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his career as a burglar, murdered whole families, including several children. But when he was in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his time at his window, watching the children playing in the prison yard. He trained one little boy to come up to his window and made great friends with him.... You don't know why I am telling you all this, Alyosha? My head aches and I am sad.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You speak with a strange air,&#8221;</span> observed Alyosha uneasily, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;as though you were not quite yourself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,&#8221;</span> Ivan went on, seeming not to hear his brother's words, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;told me about the crimes committed by Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general rising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women and children, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them so till morning, and in the morning they hang them&#8212;all sorts of things you can't imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that's a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children, too; cutting the unborn child from the mother's womb, and tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before their mothers' eyes. Doing it before the mothers' eyes was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around her. They've planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points a pistol four inches from the baby's face. The baby laughs with glee, holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the baby's face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn't it? By the way, Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brother, what are you driving at?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg262"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I think if the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him, he has created him in his own image and likeness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Just as he did God, then?&#8221;</span> observed Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's wonderful how you can turn words,&#8217;</span> as Polonius says in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Hamlet</span></span>,&#8221;</span> laughed Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You turn my words against me. Well, I am glad. Yours must be a fine God, if man created Him in his image and likeness. You asked just now what I was driving at. You see, I am fond of collecting certain facts, and, would you believe, I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and books, and I've already got a fine collection. The Turks, of course, have gone into it, but they are foreigners. I have specimens from home that are even better than the Turks. You know we prefer beating&#8212;rods and scourges&#8212;that's our national institution. Nailing ears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But the rod and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken from us. Abroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners are more humane, or laws have been passed, so that they don't dare to flog men now. But they make up for it in another way just as national as ours. And so national that it would be practically impossible among us, though I believe we are being inoculated with it, since the religious movement began in our aristocracy. I have a charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how, quite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed&#8212;a young man, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was converted to the Christian faith at the very scaffold. This Richard was an illegitimate child who was given as a child of six by his parents to some shepherds on the Swiss mountains. They brought him up to work for them. He grew up like a little wild beast among them. The shepherds taught him nothing, and scarcely fed or clothed him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flock in cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quite the contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had been given to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity of feeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years, like the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash given to the pigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldn't even give him that, and beat him when he stole from the pigs. And that was how he spent all his childhood and his youth, till he grew <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg263"></a> up and was strong enough to go away and be a thief. The savage began to earn his living as a day laborer in Geneva. He drank what he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by killing and robbing an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to death. They are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was immediately surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods, philanthropic ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write in prison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him, worked upon him, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly confessed his crime. He was converted. He wrote to the court himself that he was a monster, but that in the end God had vouchsafed him light and shown grace. All Geneva was in excitement about him&#8212;all philanthropic and religious Geneva. All the aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to the prison, kissed Richard and embraced him; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;You are our brother, you have found grace.&#8217;</span> And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes, I've found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of pigs' food, but now even I have found grace. I am dying in the Lord.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes, Richard, die in the Lord; you have shed blood and must die. Though it's not your fault that you knew not the Lord, when you coveted the pigs' food and were beaten for stealing it (which was very wrong of you, for stealing is forbidden); but you've shed blood and you must die.&#8217;</span> And on the last day, Richard, perfectly limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;This is my happiest day. I am going to the Lord.&#8217;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Yes,&#8217;</span> cry the pastors and the judges and philanthropic ladies. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;This is the happiest day of your life, for you are going to the Lord!&#8217;</span> They all walk or drive to the scaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the scaffold they call to Richard: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou hast found grace!&#8217;</span> And so, covered with his brothers' kisses, Richard is dragged on to the scaffold, and led to the guillotine. And they chopped off his head in brotherly fashion, because he had found grace. Yes, that's characteristic. That pamphlet is translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropists of aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed gratis for the enlightenment of the people. The case of Richard is interesting because it's national. Though to us it's absurd to cut off a man's head, because he has become our brother and has found grace, yet <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg264"></a> we have our own speciality, which is all but worse. Our historical pastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines in Nekrassov describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;on its meek eyes,&#8217;</span> every one must have seen it. It's peculiarly Russian. He describes how a feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move. The peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not knowing what he is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over and over again. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;However weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.&#8217;</span> The nag strains, and then he begins lashing the poor defenseless creature on its weeping, on its <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;meek eyes.&#8217;</span> The frantic beast tugs and draws the load, trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort of unnatural spasmodic action&#8212;it's awful in Nekrassov. But that's only a horse, and God has given horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taught us, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it. But men, too, can be beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their own child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven. I have an exact account of it. The papa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It stings more,&#8217;</span> said he, and so he began stinging his daughter. I know for a fact there are people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal sensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict. They beat for a minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more savagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it gasps, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Daddy! daddy!&#8217;</span> By some diabolical unseemly chance the case was brought into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have long called a barrister <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;a conscience for hire.&#8217;</span> The counsel protests in his client's defense. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;It's such a simple thing,&#8217;</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;an everyday domestic event. A father corrects his child. To our shame be it said, it is brought into court.&#8217;</span> The jury, convinced by him, give a favorable verdict. The public roars with delight that the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasn't there! I would have proposed to raise a subscription in his honor! Charming pictures.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But I've still better things about children. I've collected a great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl of five who was hated by her father and mother, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;most worthy and respectable people, of good education and breeding.&#8217;</span> You see, I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg265"></a> this love of torturing children, and children only. To all other types of humanity these torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like cultivated and humane Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting children, even fond of children themselves in that sense. It's just their defenselessness that tempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal, that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, of course, a demon lies hidden&#8212;the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off the chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney disease, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for no reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements of cruelty&#8212;shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, and because she didn't ask to be taken up at night (as though a child of five sleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they smeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her mother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor child's groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who can't even understand what's done to her, should beat her little aching heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that, friend and brother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he could not have known good and evil. Why should he know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child's prayer to <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;dear, kind God&#8217;</span>! I say nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the apple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I am making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I'll leave off if you like.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Never mind. I want to suffer too,&#8221;</span> muttered Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One picture, only one more, because it's so curious, so characteristic, and I have only just read it in some collection of Russian antiquities. I've forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg266"></a> in the darkest days of serfdom at the beginning of the century, and long live the Liberator of the People! There was in those days a general of aristocratic connections, the owner of great estates, one of those men&#8212;somewhat exceptional, I believe, even then&#8212;who, retiring from the service into a life of leisure, are convinced that they've earned absolute power over the lives of their subjects. There were such men then. So our general, settled on his property of two thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his poor neighbors as though they were dependents and buffoons. He has kennels of hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys&#8212;all mounted, and in uniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw a stone in play and hurt the paw of the general's favorite hound. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Why is my favorite dog lame?&#8217;</span> He is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog's paw. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;So you did it.&#8217;</span> The general looked the child up and down. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Take him.&#8217;</span> He was taken&#8212;taken from his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that morning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his dependents, dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full hunting parade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in front of them all stands the mother of the child. The child is brought from the lock-up. It's a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day, a capital day for hunting. The general orders the child to be undressed; the child is stripped naked. He shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry.... <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Make him run,&#8217;</span> commands the general. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Run! run!&#8217;</span> shout the dog-boys. The boy runs.... <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;At him!&#8217;</span> yells the general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the child. The hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his mother's eyes!... I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable of administering his estates. Well&#8212;what did he deserve? To be shot? To be shot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak, Alyosha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To be shot,&#8221;</span> murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a pale, twisted smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Bravo!&#8221;</span> cried Ivan, delighted. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If even you say so.... You're a pretty monk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart, Alyosha Karamazov!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What I said was absurd, but&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's just the point, that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;but&#8217;</span>!&#8221;</span> cried Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let me tell you, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg267"></a> novice, that the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world stands on absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in it without them. We know what we know!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What do you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I understand nothing,&#8221;</span> Ivan went on, as though in delirium. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't want to understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact. I made up my mind long ago not to understand. If I try to understand anything, I shall be false to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the fact.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why are you trying me?&#8221;</span> Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Will you say what you mean at last?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Of course, I will; that's what I've been leading up to. You are dear to me, I don't want to let you go, and I won't give you up to your Zossima.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Ivan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer. Of the other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its crust to its center, I will say nothing. I have narrowed my subject on purpose. I am a bug, and I recognize in all humility that I cannot understand why the world is arranged as it is. Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; they were given paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven, though they knew they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity them. With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know is that there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause follows effect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its level&#8212;but that's only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I can't consent to live by it! What comfort is it to me that there are none guilty and that cause follows effect simply and directly, and that I know it?&#8212;I must have justice, or I will destroy myself. And not justice in some remote infinite time and space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself. I have believed in it. I want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me rise again, for if it all happens without me, it will be too unfair. Surely I haven't suffered, simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manure the soil of the future harmony for somebody else. I want to see with my own eyes the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace his murderer. I want to be there when every one suddenly understands <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg268"></a> what it has all been for. All the religions of the world are built on this longing, and I am a believer. But then there are the children, and what am I to do about them? That's a question I can't answer. For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions, but I've only taken the children, because in their case what I mean is so unanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal harmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please? It's beyond all comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for the harmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the harmony of the future? I understand solidarity in sin among men. I understand solidarity in retribution, too; but there can be no such solidarity with children. And if it is really true that they must share responsibility for all their fathers' crimes, such a truth is not of this world and is beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say, perhaps, that the child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he didn't grow up, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh, Alyosha, I am not blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an upheaval of the universe it will be, when everything in heaven and earth blends in one hymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries aloud: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.&#8217;</span> When the mother embraces the fiend who threw her child to the dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Thou art just, O Lord!&#8217;</span> then, of course, the crown of knowledge will be reached and all will be made clear. But what pulls me up here is that I can't accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take my own measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if I live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cry aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the child's torturer, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Thou art just, O Lord!&#8217;</span> but I don't want to cry aloud then. While there is still time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higher harmony altogether. It's not worth the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;dear, kind God&#8217;</span>! It's not worth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for, or there can be no harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them? Is it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg269"></a> them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do, since those children have already been tortured? And what becomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don't want more suffering. And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth such a price. I don't want the mother to embrace the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let her forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for the immeasurable suffering of her mother's heart. But the sufferings of her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don't want harmony. From love for humanity I don't want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">even if I were wrong</span></em>. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It's not God that I don't accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's rebellion,&#8221;</span> murmured Alyosha, looking down.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,&#8221;</span> said Ivan earnestly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One can hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me yourself, I challenge you&#8212;answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature&#8212;that baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance&#8212;and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the truth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I wouldn't consent,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha softly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it would agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated blood of a little victim? And accepting it would remain happy for ever?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg270"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I can't admit it. Brother,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha suddenly, with flashing eyes, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;you said just now, is there a being in the whole world who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? But there is a Being and He can forgive everything, all and for all, because He gave His innocent blood for all and everything. You have forgotten Him, and on Him is built the edifice, and it is to Him they cry aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed!&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten Him; on the contrary I've been wondering all the time how it was you did not bring Him in before, for usually all arguments on your side put Him in the foreground. Do you know, Alyosha&#8212;don't laugh! I made a poem about a year ago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I'll tell it to you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You wrote a poem?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, no, I didn't write it,&#8221;</span> laughed Ivan, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and I've never written two lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my first reader&#8212;that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?&#8221;</span> smiled Ivan. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Shall I tell it to you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am all attention,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My poem is called <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;The Grand Inquisitor&#8217;</span>; it's a ridiculous thing, but I want to tell it to you.&#8221;</span></p>
