<p class="tei tei-p c3">The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.&#8221;</span> All this was done by Father Pa&#239;ssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross. On his head he put a hood with an eight-cornered cross. The hood was left open and the dead man's face was covered with black gauze. In his hands was put an ikon of the Saviour. Towards morning he was put in the coffin which had been made ready long before. It was decided to leave the coffin all day in the cell, in the larger room in which the elder used to receive his visitors and fellow monks. As the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest rule, the Gospel, not the Psalter, had to be read over his body by monks in holy orders. The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after the requiem service. Father Pa&#239;ssy desired later on to read the Gospel all day and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as well as the Father Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied, for something extraordinary, an unheard-of, even <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;unseemly&#8221;</span> excitement and impatient expectation began to be apparent in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg363"></a> monks, and the visitors from the monastery hostels, and the crowds of people flocking from the town. And as time went on, this grew more and more marked. Both the Superintendent and Father Pa&#239;ssy did their utmost to calm the general bustle and agitation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">When it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their sick, in most cases children, with them from the town&#8212;as though they had been waiting expressly for this moment to do so, evidently persuaded that the dead elder's remains had a power of healing, which would be immediately made manifest in accordance with their faith. It was only then apparent how unquestionably every one in our town had accepted Father Zossima during his lifetime as a great saint. And those who came were far from being all of the humbler classes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">This intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with such haste, such openness, even with impatience and almost insistence, impressed Father Pa&#239;ssy as unseemly. Though he had long foreseen something of the sort, the actual manifestation of the feeling was beyond anything he had looked for. When he came across any of the monks who displayed this excitement, Father Pa&#239;ssy began to reprove them. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Such immediate expectation of something extraordinary,&#8221;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;shows a levity, possible to worldly people but unseemly in us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But little attention was paid him and Father Pa&#239;ssy noticed it uneasily. Yet he himself (if the whole truth must be told), secretly at the bottom of his heart, cherished almost the same hopes and could not but be aware of it, though he was indignant at the too impatient expectation around him, and saw in it light-mindedness and vanity. Nevertheless, it was particularly unpleasant to him to meet certain persons, whose presence aroused in him great misgivings. In the crowd in the dead man's cell he noticed with inward aversion (for which he immediately reproached himself) the presence of Rakitin and of the monk from Obdorsk, who was still staying in the monastery. Of both of them Father Pa&#239;ssy felt for some reason suddenly suspicious&#8212;though, indeed, he might well have felt the same about others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the excited crowd. He was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he was asking questions, everywhere he was listening, on all sides he was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg364"></a> whispering with a peculiar, mysterious air. His expression showed the greatest impatience and even a sort of irritation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">As for Rakitin, he, as appeared later, had come so early to the hermitage at the special request of Madame Hohlakov. As soon as that good-hearted but weak-minded woman, who could not herself have been admitted to the hermitage, waked and heard of the death of Father Zossima, she was overtaken with such intense curiosity that she promptly dispatched Rakitin to the hermitage, to keep a careful look out and report to her by letter every half-hour or so <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;<em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">everything that takes place</span></em>.&#8221;</span> She regarded Rakitin as a most religious and devout young man. He was particularly clever in getting round people and assuming whatever part he thought most to their taste, if he detected the slightest advantage to himself from doing so.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were thronging about the tombs, which were particularly numerous round the church and scattered here and there about the hermitage. As he walked round the hermitage, Father Pa&#239;ssy remembered Alyosha and that he had not seen him for some time, not since the night. And he had no sooner thought of him than he at once noticed him in the farthest corner of the hermitage garden, sitting on the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for his saintliness. He sat with his back to the hermitage and his face to the wall, and seemed to be hiding behind the tombstone. Going up to him, Father Pa&#239;ssy saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly, with his face hidden in his hands, and that his whole frame was shaking with sobs. Father Pa&#239;ssy stood over him for a little.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Enough, dear son, enough, dear,&#8221;</span> he pronounced with feeling at last. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why do you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Don't you know that this is the greatest of his days? Think only where he is now, at this moment!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha glanced at him, uncovering his face, which was swollen with crying like a child's, but turned away at once without uttering a word and hid his face in his hands again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Maybe it is well,&#8221;</span> said Father Pa&#239;ssy thoughtfully; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;weep if you must, Christ has sent you those tears.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will serve to gladden your dear heart,&#8221;</span> he added to himself, walking away <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg365"></a> from Alyosha, and thinking lovingly of him. He moved away quickly, however, for he felt that he too might weep looking at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Meanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the requiems for the dead followed in their due course. Father Pa&#239;ssy again took Father Iosif's place by the coffin and began reading the Gospel. But before three o'clock in the afternoon that something took place to which I alluded at the end of the last book, something so unexpected by all of us and so contrary to the general hope, that, I repeat, this trivial incident has been minutely remembered to this day in our town and all the surrounding neighborhood. I may add here, for myself personally, that I feel it almost repulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation and was such a stumbling-block to many, though in reality it was the most natural and trivial matter. I should, of course, have omitted all mention of it in my story, if it had not exerted a very strong influence on the heart and soul of the chief, though future, hero of my story, Alyosha, forming a crisis and turning-point in his spiritual development, giving a shock to his intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his life and gave it a definite aim.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And so, to return to our story. When before dawn they laid Father Zossima's body in the coffin and brought it into the front room, the question of opening the windows was raised among those who were around the coffin. But this suggestion made casually by some one was unanswered and almost unnoticed. Some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticed it, only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from the body of such a saint was an actual absurdity, calling for compassion (if not a smile) for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied. For they expected something quite different.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by three o'clock those signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated to the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in the shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it, believers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for the believers some of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg366"></a> them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;men love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,&#8221;</span> as the deceased elder had said in one of his exhortations.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin, growing gradually more marked, and by three o'clock it was quite unmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandal could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have been possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after this discovery among the very monks themselves. Afterwards, even many years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when they recalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions. For in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God-fearing old men, whose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins, too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement. Of course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption. This fact was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by God's grace, of still greater glory from their tombs in the future.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job, who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five. He had been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence, and his tomb was pointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect and mysterious hints of great hopes connected with it. (That was the very tomb on which Father Pa&#239;ssy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Another memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy, who was only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in the eldership. He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of these had lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light in their faces. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came from their bodies.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg367"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explain the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin of Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that several different causes were simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply-rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks. Even more powerful was jealousy of the dead man's saintliness, so firmly established during his lifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it. For though the late elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles, and had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents, none the less, in fact, rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy and so had come to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only in the monastery but in the world outside it. He did no one any harm, but <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why do they think him so saintly?&#8221;</span> And that question alone, gradually repeated, gave rise at last to an intense, insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe, was why many people were extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition which came so quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At the same time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently devoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally affronted by this incident. This was how the thing happened.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">As soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole aspect of the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell. They went in, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to the crowd of other monks waiting outside. Some of the latter shook their heads mournfully, but others did not even care to conceal the delight which gleamed unmistakably in their malignant eyes. And now no one reproached them for it, no one raised his voice in protest, which was strange, for the majority of the monks had been devoted to the dead elder. But it seemed as though God had in this case let the minority get the upper hand for a time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Visitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon went into the cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the peasantry few went into the cell, though there were crowds of them at the gates of the hermitage. After three o'clock the rush of worldly visitors was greatly increased and this was no doubt owing to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg368"></a> shocking news. People were attracted who would not otherwise have come on that day and had not intended to come, and among them were some personages of high standing. But external decorum was still preserved and Father Pa&#239;ssy, with a stern face, continued firmly and distinctly reading aloud the Gospel, apparently not noticing what was taking place around him, though he had, in fact, observed something unusual long before. But at last the murmurs, first subdued but gradually louder and more confident, reached even him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It shows God's judgment is not as man's,&#8221;</span> Father Pa&#239;ssy heard suddenly. The first to give utterance to this sentiment was a layman, an elderly official from the town, known to be a man of great piety. But he only repeated aloud what the monks had long been whispering. They had long before formulated this damning conclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfaction at that conclusion became more and more apparent every moment. Soon they began to lay aside even external decorum and almost seemed to feel they had a sort of right to discard it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And for what reason can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">this</span></em> have happened,&#8221;</span> some of the monks said, at first with a show of regret; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;he had a small frame and his flesh was dried up on his bones, what was there to decay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It must be a sign from heaven,&#8221;</span> others hastened to add, and their opinion was adopted at once without protest. For it was pointed out, too, that if the decomposition had been natural, as in the case of every dead sinner, it would have been apparent later, after a lapse of at least twenty-four hours, but this premature corruption <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;was in excess of nature,&#8221;</span> and so the finger of God was evident. It was meant for a sign. This conclusion seemed irresistible.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Gentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead man's, tried to reply to some of the evil speakers that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;this is not held everywhere alike,&#8221;</span> and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the just was not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an opinion, and that even in the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for instance, they were not greatly confounded by the smell of corruption, and there the chief sign of the glorification of the saved was not bodily incorruptibility, but the color of the bones when the bodies have lain many years in the earth and have decayed in it. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And if the bones are yellow as wax, that is the great sign that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg369"></a> Lord has glorified the dead saint, if they are not yellow but black, it shows that God has not deemed him worthy of such glory&#8212;that is the belief in Athos, a great place, where the Orthodox doctrine has been preserved from of old, unbroken and in its greatest purity,&#8221;</span> said Father Iosif in conclusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the meek Father's words had little effect and even provoked a mocking retort. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's all pedantry and innovation, no use listening to it,&#8221;</span> the monks decided. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We stick to the old doctrine, there are all sorts of innovations nowadays, are we to follow them all?&#8221;</span> added others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are among the Turks, they have forgotten everything. Their doctrine has long been impure and they have no bells even,&#8221;</span> the most sneering added.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he had put forward his own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing in it himself. He foresaw with distress that something very unseemly was beginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience. Little by little, all the sensible monks were reduced to silence like Father Iosif. And so it came to pass that all who loved the elder and had accepted with devout obedience the institution of the eldership were all at once terribly cast down and glanced timidly in one another's faces, when they met. Those who were hostile to the institution of elders, as a novelty, held up their heads proudly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There was no smell of corruption from the late elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance,&#8221;</span> they recalled malignantly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But he gained that glory not because he was an elder, but because he was a holy man.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of Father Zossima. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;His teaching was false; he taught that life is a great joy and not a vale of tears,&#8221;</span> said some of the more unreasonable. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He followed the fashionable belief, he did not recognize material fire in hell,&#8221;</span> others, still more unreasonable, added. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was not strict in fasting, allowed himself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his tea, ladies used to send it to him. Is it for a monk of strict rule to drink tea?&#8221;</span> could be heard among some of the envious. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He sat in pride,&#8221;</span> the most malignant declared vindictively; <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;he considered himself a saint and he took it as his due when people <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg370"></a> knelt before him.&#8221;</span> <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He abused the sacrament of confession,&#8221;</span> the fiercest opponents of the institution of elders added in a malicious whisper. And among these were some of the oldest monks, strictest in their devotion, genuine ascetics, who had kept silent during the life of the deceased elder, but now suddenly unsealed their lips. And this was terrible, for their words had great influence on young monks who were not yet firm in their convictions. The monk from Obdorsk heard all this attentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding his head. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, clearly Father Ferapont was right in his judgment yesterday,&#8221;</span> and at that moment Father Ferapont himself made his appearance, as though on purpose to increase the confusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by the apiary. He was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked this neglect on the ground of his craziness, and did not keep him to the rules binding on all the rest. But if the whole truth is to be told, they hardly had a choice about it. For it would have been discreditable to insist on burdening with the common regulations so great an ascetic, who prayed day and night (he even dropped asleep on his knees). If they had insisted, the monks would have said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He is holier than all of us and he follows a rule harder than ours. And if he does not go to church, it's because he knows when he ought to; he has his own rule.&#8221;</span> It was to avoid the chance of these sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont was left in peace.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">As every one was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked Father Zossima. And now the news had reached him in his hut that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;God's judgment is not the same as man's,&#8221;</span> and that something had happened which was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;in excess of nature.&#8221;</span> It may well be supposed that among the first to run to him with the news was the monk from Obdorsk, who had visited him the evening before and left his cell terror-stricken.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I have mentioned above, that though Father Pa&#239;ssy, standing firm and immovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear nor see what was passing outside the cell, he gauged most of it correctly in his heart, for he knew the men surrounding him, well. He was not shaken by it, but awaited what would come next without fear, watching with penetration and insight for the outcome of the general excitement.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg371"></a> of decorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father Ferapont appeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen accompanying him a crowd of monks, together with many people from the town. They did not, however, enter the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps, waiting to see what Father Ferapont would say or do. For they felt with a certain awe, in spite of their audacity, that he had not come for nothing. Standing in the doorway, Father Ferapont raised his arms, and under his right arm the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk from Obdorsk peeped in. He alone, in his intense curiosity, could not resist running up the steps after Father Ferapont. The others, on the contrary, pressed farther back in sudden alarm when the door was noisily flung open. Holding his hands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly roared:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Casting out I cast out!&#8221;</span> and, turning in all directions, he began at once making the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and four corners of the cell in succession. All who accompanied Father Ferapont immediately understood his action. For they knew he always did this wherever he went, and that he would not sit down or say a word, till he had driven out the evil spirits.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence!&#8221;</span> he repeated at each sign of the cross. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Casting out I cast out,&#8221;</span> he roared again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope. His bare chest, covered with gray hair, could be seen under his hempen shirt. His feet were bare. As soon as he began waving his arms, the cruel irons he wore under his gown could be heard clanking.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Pa&#239;ssy paused in his reading, stepped forward and stood before him waiting.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What have you come for, worthy Father? Why do you offend against good order? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock?&#8221;</span> he said at last, looking sternly at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?&#8221;</span> shouted Father Ferapont crazily. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've come here to drive out your visitors, the unclean devils. I've come to see how many have gathered here while I have been away. I want to sweep them out with a birch broom.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him yourself,&#8221;</span> Father Pa&#239;ssy went on fearlessly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And who can say of himself <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;I am holy&#8217;</span>? Can you, Father?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg372"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am unclean, not holy. I would not sit in an arm-chair and would not have them bow down to me as an idol,&#8221;</span> thundered Father Ferapont. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nowadays folk destroy the true faith. The dead man, your saint,&#8221;</span> he turned to the crowd, pointing with his finger to the coffin, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;did not believe in devils. He gave medicine to keep off the devils. And so they have become as common as spiders in the corners. And now he has begun to stink himself. In that we see a great sign from God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The incident he referred to was this. One of the monks was haunted in his dreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions of evil spirits. When in the utmost terror he confided this to Father Zossima, the elder had advised continual prayer and rigid fasting. But when that was of no use, he advised him, while persisting in prayer and fasting, to take a special medicine. Many persons were shocked at the time and wagged their heads as they talked over it&#8212;and most of all Father Ferapont, to whom some of the censorious had hastened to report this <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;extraordinary&#8221;</span> counsel on the part of the elder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Go away, Father!&#8221;</span> said Father Pa&#239;ssy, in a commanding voice, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;it's not for man to judge but for God. Perhaps we see here a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;sign&#8217;</span> which neither you, nor I, nor any one of us is able to comprehend. Go, Father, and do not trouble the flock!&#8221;</span> he repeated impressively.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the sign has come. That is clear and it's a sin to hide it,&#8221;</span> the fanatic, carried away by a zeal that outstripped his reason, would not be quieted. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He was seduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought them to him in their pockets, he sipped tea, he worshiped his belly, filling it with sweet things and his mind with haughty thoughts.... And for this he is put to shame....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You speak lightly, Father.&#8221;</span> Father Pa&#239;ssy, too, raised his voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I admire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly like some frivolous youth, fickle and childish. Go away, Father, I command you!&#8221;</span> Father Pa&#239;ssy thundered in conclusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will go,&#8221;</span> said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but still as bitter. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You learned men! You are so clever you look down upon my humbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg373"></a> have forgotten what I did know, God Himself has preserved me in my weakness from your subtlety.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Pa&#239;ssy stood over him, waiting resolutely. Father Ferapont paused and, suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently, pronounced in a sing-song voice, looking at the coffin of the dead elder:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To-morrow they will sing over him <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Our Helper and Defender&#8217;</span>&#8212;a splendid anthem&#8212;and over me when I die all they'll sing will be <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;What earthly joy&#8217;</span>&#8212;a little canticle,&#8221;</span><a href="the-brothers-karamazov-60.html#note_6" id="noteref_6" class="dlinternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span class="c24">6</span></span></a> he added with tearful regret. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are proud and puffed up, this is a vain place!&#8221;</span> he shouted suddenly like a madman, and with a wave of his hand he turned quickly and quickly descended the steps. The crowd awaiting him below wavered; some followed him at once and some lingered, for the cell was still open, and Father Pa&#239;ssy, following Father Ferapont on to the steps, stood watching him. But the excited old fanatic was not completely silenced. Walking twenty steps away, he suddenly turned towards the setting sun, raised both his arms and, as though some one had cut him down, fell to the ground with a loud scream.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My God has conquered! Christ has conquered the setting sun!&#8221;</span> he shouted frantically, stretching up his hands to the sun, and falling face downwards on the ground, he sobbed like a little child, shaken by his tears and spreading out his arms on the ground. Then all rushed up to him; there were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ... a kind of frenzy seemed to take possession of them all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a holy man!&#8221;</span> some cried aloud, losing their fear. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;This is he who should be an elder,&#8221;</span> others added malignantly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;He wouldn't be an elder ... he would refuse ... he wouldn't serve a cursed innovation ... he wouldn't imitate their foolery,&#8221;</span> other voices chimed in at once. And it is hard to say how far they might have gone, but at that moment the bell rang summoning them to service. All began crossing themselves at once. Father Ferapont, too, got up and crossing himself went back to his cell without looking round, still uttering exclamations which were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg374"></a> utterly incoherent. A few followed him, but the greater number dispersed, hastening to service. Father Pa&#239;ssy let Father Iosif read in his place and went down. The frantic outcries of bigots could not shake him, but his heart was suddenly filled with melancholy for some special reason and he felt that. He stood still and suddenly wondered, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why am I sad even to dejection?&#8221;</span> and immediately grasped with surprise that his sudden sadness was due to a very small and special cause. In the crowd thronging at the entrance to the cell, he had noticed Alyosha and he remembered that he had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing him. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can that boy mean so much to my heart now?&#8221;</span> he asked himself, wondering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but not in the direction of the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly turned away his eyes and dropped them to the ground, and from the boy's look alone, Father Pa&#239;ssy guessed what a great change was taking place in him at that moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you, too, fallen into temptation?&#8221;</span> cried Father Pa&#239;ssy. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can you be with those of little faith?&#8221;</span> he added mournfully.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha stood still and gazed vaguely at Father Pa&#239;ssy, but quickly turned his eyes away again and again looked on the ground. He stood sideways and did not turn his face to Father Pa&#239;ssy, who watched him attentively.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where are you hastening? The bell calls to service,&#8221;</span> he asked again, but again Alyosha gave no answer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you leaving the hermitage? What, without asking leave, without asking a blessing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange, look at the Father to whom his former guide, the former sovereign of his heart and mind, his beloved elder, had confided him as he lay dying. And suddenly, still without speaking, waved his hand, as though not caring even to be respectful, and with rapid steps walked towards the gates away from the hermitage.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You will come back again!&#8221;</span> murmured Father Pa&#239;ssy, looking after him with sorrowful surprise.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00053"><span class="c9">Chapter II. A Critical Moment</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Father Pa&#239;ssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;dear boy&#8221;</span> would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he penetrated with insight into the true meaning of Alyosha's spiritual condition. Yet I must frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I love so much. To Father Pa&#239;ssy's sorrowful question, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Are you too with those of little faith?&#8221;</span> I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, he is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.&#8221;</span> Indeed, all his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days of his life. If the question is asked: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Could all his grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder's body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?&#8221;</span> I must answer without beating about the bush, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, it certainly was.&#8221;</span> I would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero's pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the little progress he had made in his studies, or any such reason. I must declare, on the contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of his heart. No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose love was lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so of little value, such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what happened to my hero. But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away by an emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than to be unmoved. And this is even truer in youth, for a young man who is always sensible is to be suspected and is of little worth&#8212;that's my opinion!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But,&#8221;</span> reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;every young man cannot believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg376"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">To this I reply again, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and steadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should not explain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary for the understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say then, it was not a question of miracles. There was no frivolous and impatient expectation of miracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time, for the triumph of some preconceived idea&#8212;oh, no, not at all&#8212;what he saw before all was one figure&#8212;the figure of his beloved elder, the figure of that holy man whom he revered with such adoration. The fact is that all the love that lay concealed in his pure young heart for every one and everything had, for the past year, been concentrated&#8212;and perhaps wrongly so&#8212;on one being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so long been accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and energy could not but turn towards that ideal, even to the forgetting at the moment <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;of every one and everything.&#8221;</span> He remembered afterwards how, on that terrible day, he had entirely forgotten his brother Dmitri, about whom he had been so anxious and troubled the day before; he had forgotten, too, to take the two hundred roubles to Ilusha's father, though he had so warmly intended to do so the preceding evening. But again it was not miracles he needed but only <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the higher justice&#8221;</span> which had been in his belief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his heart. And what does it signify that this <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;justice&#8221;</span> looked for by Alyosha inevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the ashes of his adored teacher? Why, every one in the monastery cherished the same thought and the same hope, even those whose intellects Alyosha revered, Father Pa&#239;ssy himself, for instance. And so Alyosha, untroubled by doubts, clothed his dreams too in the same form as all the rest. And a whole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of this expectation in his heart. But it was justice, justice, he thirsted for, not simply miracles.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted above every one in the whole world, that man, instead of receiving the glory that was his due, was suddenly degraded and dishonored! What for? Who had judged him? Who could have decreed this? Those were the questions that wrung his inexperienced and virginal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg377"></a> heart. He could not endure without mortification, without resentment even, that the holiest of holy men should have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the frivolous crowd so inferior to him. Even had there been no miracles, had there been nothing marvelous to justify his hopes, why this indignity, why this humiliation, why this premature decay, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;in excess of nature,&#8221;</span> as the spiteful monks said? Why this <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;sign from heaven,&#8221;</span> which they so triumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did they believe they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where is the finger of Providence? Why did Providence hide its face <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;at the most critical moment&#8221;</span> (so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily submitting to the blind, dumb, pitiless laws of nature?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">That was why Alyosha's heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I have said already, the sting of it all was that the man he loved above everything on earth should be put to shame and humiliated! This murmuring may have been shallow and unreasonable in my hero, but I repeat again for the third time&#8212;and am prepared to admit that it might be difficult to defend my feeling&#8212;I am glad that my hero showed himself not too reasonable at that moment, for any man of sense will always come back to reason in time, but, if love does not gain the upper hand in a boy's heart at such an exceptional moment, when will it? I will not, however, omit to mention something strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha's mind at this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was the harassing impression left by the conversation with Ivan, which now persistently haunted Alyosha's mind. At this moment it haunted him. Oh, it was not that something of the fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul had been shaken. He loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though he was suddenly murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of his consciousness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face downwards on the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep. He went up and called him by his name.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg378"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You here, Alexey? Can you have&#8212;&#8221;</span> he began wondering but broke off. He had meant to say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can you have come to this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin at once saw that he heard and understood him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What's the matter?&#8221;</span> he went on; but the surprise in his face gradually passed into a smile that became more and more ironical.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I say, I've been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenly disappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this? You might just look at me...&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the tree. He was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and irritability in his face. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but looked away to one side of him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know your face is quite changed? There's none of your famous mildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one? Have they been ill-treating you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let me alone,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of his hand, still looking away from him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oho! So that's how we are feeling! So you can shout at people like other mortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say, Alyosha, you have surprised me, do you hear? I mean it. It's long since I've been surprised at anything here. I always took you for an educated man....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely understanding what he said.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to stink? You don't mean to say you seriously believed that he was going to work miracles?&#8221;</span> exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what more do you want?&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha irritably.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of thirteen believes in that now. But there.... So now you are in a temper with your God, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn't given promotion, He hasn't bestowed the order of merit! Eh, you are a set!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg379"></a> and there was a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger with Rakitin.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am not rebelling against my God; I simply <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;don't accept His world.&#8217;</span>&#8201;&#8221;</span> Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do you mean, you don't accept the world?&#8221;</span> Rakitin thought a moment over his answer. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What idiocy is this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha did not answer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything to eat to-day?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't remember.... I think I have.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry to look at you. You didn't sleep all night either, I hear, you had a meeting in there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most likely you've had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I've got some sausage in my pocket; I've brought it from the town in case of need, only you won't eat sausage....&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give me some.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I say! You are going it! Why, it's a regular mutiny, with barricades! Well, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my place.... I shouldn't mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death. Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose ... or would you like some?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give me some vodka too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Hullo! You surprise me, brother!&#8221;</span> Rakitin looked at him in amazement. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a jolly fine chance and mustn't be missed. Come along.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;If your little brother Ivan could see this&#8212;wouldn't he be surprised! By the way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this morning, did you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes,&#8221;</span> answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of his brother Dmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute, and though it reminded him of something that must not be put off for a moment, some duty, some terrible obligation, even that reminder made no impression on him, did not reach his heart and instantly faded out of his mind and was forgotten. But, a long while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;liberal booby <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg380"></a> with no talents whatsoever.&#8217;</span> Once you, too, could not resist letting me know I was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;dishonorable.&#8217;</span> Well! I should like to see what your talents and sense of honor will do for you now.&#8221;</span> This phrase Rakitin finished to himself in a whisper.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen!&#8221;</span> he said aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;let's go by the path beyond the monastery straight to the town. Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakov's by the way. Only fancy, I've written to tell her everything that happened, and would you believe it, she answered me instantly in pencil (the lady has a passion for writing notes) that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;she would never have expected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">such conduct</span></em> from a man of such a reverend character as Father Zossima.&#8217;</span> That was her very word: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;conduct.&#8217;</span> She is angry too. Eh, you are a set! Stay!&#8221;</span> he cried suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by the shoulder made him stop too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know, Alyosha,&#8221;</span> he peeped inquisitively into his eyes, absorbed in a sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and though he was laughing outwardly he was evidently afraid to utter that new idea aloud, so difficult he still found it to believe in the strange and unexpected mood in which he now saw Alyosha. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha, do you know where we had better go?&#8221;</span> he brought out at last timidly, and insinuatingly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I don't care ... where you like.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let's go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?&#8221;</span> pronounced Rakitin at last, trembling with timid suspense.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let's go to Grushenka,&#8221;</span> Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and this prompt and calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin that he almost started back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well! I say!&#8221;</span> he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly by the arm he led him along the path, still dreading that he would change his mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to talk.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And how glad she will be, how delighted!&#8221;</span> he muttered, but lapsed into silence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka he was taking Alyosha to her. He was a practical person and never undertook anything without a prospect of gain for himself. His object in this case was twofold, first a revengeful desire to see <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the downfall of the righteous,&#8221;</span> and Alyosha's fall <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;from the saints <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg381"></a> to the sinners,&#8221;</span> over which he was already gloating in his imagination, and in the second place he had in view a certain material gain for himself, of which more will be said later.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So the critical moment has come,&#8221;</span> he thought to himself with spiteful glee, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and we shall catch it on the hop, for it's just what we want.&#8221;</span></p>
