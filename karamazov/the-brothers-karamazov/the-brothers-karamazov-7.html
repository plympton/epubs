<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00018"><span class="c9">Chapter I. In The Servants' Quarters</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The Karamazovs' house was far from being in the center of the town, but it was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking old house of two stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was roomy and snug, and might still last many years. There were all sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases. There were rats in it, but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike them. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One doesn't feel so solitary when one's left alone in the evening,&#8221;</span> he used to say. It was his habit to send the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone. The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although there was a kitchen in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter and summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. The house was built for a large family; there was room for five times as many, with their servants. But at the time of our story there was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son Ivan. And in the lodge there were only three servants: old Grigory, and his old wife Marfa, and a young man called Smerdyakov. Of these three we must say a few words. Of old Grigory we have said something already. He was firm and determined and went blindly and obstinately for his object, if once he had been brought by any reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe that it was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, had obeyed her husband's will implicitly all her life, yet she had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs. She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow with their small savings. But Grigory decided then, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg098"></a> once for all, that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the woman's talking nonsense, for every woman is dishonest,&#8221;</span> and that they ought not to leave their old master, whatever he might be, for <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that was now their duty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you understand what duty is?&#8221;</span> he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why it's our duty to stay here I never shall understand,&#8221;</span> Marfa answered firmly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, don't understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold your tongue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch promised them a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory knew, too, that he had an indisputable influence over his master. It was true, and he was aware of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though his will was strong enough <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;in some of the affairs of life,&#8221;</span> as he expressed it, he found himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in facing certain other emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them. There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And that's not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory's intervention, and on each occasion the old servant gave him a good lecture. But it wasn't only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch was afraid of. There were graver occasions, and very subtle and complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often cruel in his lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes, in moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My soul's simply quaking in my throat at those times,&#8221;</span> he used to say. At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand, in the lodge if not in the room, a strong, faithful man, virtuous and unlike himself, who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his secrets, but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that, not to oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or threaten him with anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in case of need, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg099"></a> to defend him&#8212;from whom? From somebody unknown, but terrible and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c19">another</span></em> man, an old and tried friend, that he might call him in his sick moments merely to look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange some quite irrelevant words with him. And if the old servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he were angry, he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however) that Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and fetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would soon let him go again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he had gone, Fyodor Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of the just. Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha's arrival. Alyosha <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;pierced his heart&#8221;</span> by <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;living with him, seeing everything and blaming nothing.&#8221;</span> Moreover, Alyosha brought with him something his father had never known before: a complete absence of contempt for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural unaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was a complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till then loved nothing but <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;evil.&#8221;</span> When Alyosha had left him, he confessed to himself that he had learnt something he had not till then been willing to learn.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adela&#239;da Ivanovna, the first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of Dmitri, and that he had, on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna, the poor <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;crazy woman,&#8221;</span> against his master and any one who chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. His sympathy for the unhappy wife had become something sacred to him, so that even now, twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion to her from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally, Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his words, without frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight whether he loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love her, and she knew it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed, cleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg100"></a> in worldly affairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything without question or complaint ever since her marriage, and respected him for his spiritual superiority. It was remarkable how little they spoke to one another in the course of their lives, and only of the most necessary daily affairs. The grave and dignified Grigory thought over all his cares and duties alone, so that Marfa Ignatyevna had long grown used to knowing that he did not need her advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and took it as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once, and then only slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch's marriage with Adela&#239;da Ivanovna, the village girls and women&#8212;at that time serfs&#8212;were called together before the house to sing and dance. They were beginning <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;In the Green Meadows,&#8221;</span> when Marfa, at that time a young woman, skipped forward and danced <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the Russian Dance,&#8221;</span> not in the village fashion, but as she had danced it when she was a servant in the service of the rich Mi&#252;sov family, in their private theater, where the actors were taught to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his wife danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave her a lesson, pulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating was never repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">God had not blessed them with children. One child was born but it died. Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of showing it. When Adela&#239;da Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took Dmitri, then a child of three years old, combed his hair and washed him in a tub with his own hands, and looked after him for almost a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivan and Alyosha, for which the general's widow had rewarded him with a slap in the face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his own child had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth. When it was born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The baby had six fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was not only silent till the day of the christening, but kept away in the garden. It was spring, and he spent three days digging the kitchen garden. The third day was fixed for christening the baby: mean-time Grigory had reached a conclusion. Going into the cottage where the clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand god-father, he suddenly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg101"></a> announced that the baby <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;ought not to be christened at all.&#8221;</span> He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and gazing with dull intentness at the priest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</span> asked the priest with good-humored surprise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Because it's a dragon,&#8221;</span> muttered Grigory.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A dragon? What dragon?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grigory did not speak for some time. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's a confusion of nature,&#8221;</span> he muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to say more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory prayed earnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child remained unchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long as the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to notice it, and for the most part kept out of the cottage. But when, at the end of a fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid the child in its little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when they were filling up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and bowed down to the earth. He did not for years afterwards mention his child, nor did Marfa speak of the baby before him, and, even if Grigory were not present, she never spoke of it above a whisper. Marfa observed that, from the day of the burial, he devoted himself to <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;religion,&#8221;</span> and took to reading the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Lives of the Saints</span></span>, for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and always putting on his big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read aloud, only perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had somehow got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the God-fearing Father Isaac the Syrian,&#8221;</span> which he read persistently for years together, understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing and loving it the more for that. Of late he had begun to listen to the doctrines of the sect of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood. He was evidently shaken by them, but judged it unfitting to go over to the new faith. His habit of theological reading gave him an expression of still greater gravity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his deformed child, and its death, had, as though by special design, been accompanied by another strange and marvelous event, which, as he said later, had left a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;stamp&#8221;</span> upon his soul. It happened that, on the very night after the burial of his child, Marfa was awakened <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg102"></a> by the wail of a new-born baby. She was frightened and waked her husband. He listened and said he thought it was more like some one groaning, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;it might be a woman.&#8221;</span> He got up and dressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from the bath-house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath-house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath-house and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak. But her story needs a chapter to itself.</p>

<div class="tei tei-div c2">
<a id="toc37"></a> <a id="pdf38"></a>
<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00019"><span class="c9">Chapter II. Lizaveta</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;not five foot within a wee bit,&#8221;</span> as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg103"></a> called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead. Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God. Ilya's employers, and many others in the town, especially of the tradespeople, tried to clothe her better, and always rigged her out with high boots and sheepskin coat for the winter. But, although she allowed them to dress her up without resisting, she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral porch, and taking off all that had been given her&#8212;kerchief, sheepskin, skirt or boots&#8212;she left them there and walked away barefoot in her smock as before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor of the province, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw Lizaveta, and was wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And though he was told she was an idiot, he pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties, and must not occur again. But the governor went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At last her father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one seemed to like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of our town, especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She would walk into strange houses, and no one drove her away. Every one was kind to her and gave her something. If she were given a copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in the alms-jug of the church or prison. If she were given a roll or bun in the market, she would hand it to the first child she met. Sometimes she would stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it to her, and the lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted anything but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop, where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept watch on her, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked by them, she would not have touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went to church. She slept either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdle (there are many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town) into a kitchen garden. She used at least once a week to turn up <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;at home,&#8221;</span> that is at the house of her <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg104"></a> father's former employers, and in the winter went there every night, and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. People were amazed that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed to it, and, although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Some of the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, but that is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from time to time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have been proud?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September (many years ago) five or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a very late hour, according to our provincial notions. They passed through the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;back-way,&#8221;</span> which led between the back gardens of the houses, with hurdles on either side. This way leads out on to the bridge over the long, stinking pool which we were accustomed to call a river. Among the nettles and burdocks under the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They stopped to look at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness. It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a woman, and so forth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance that it was impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was among them, sprang forward and declared that it was by no means impossible, and that, indeed, there was a certain piquancy about it, and so on.... It is true that at that time he was overdoing his part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself forward and entertain the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course, though in reality he was on a servile footing with them. It was just at the time when he had received the news of his first wife's death in Petersburg, and, with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of him. The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; and one of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The others repelled the idea even more emphatically, although still with the utmost hilarity, and at last they went on their way. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that he had gone with them, and perhaps it was so, no one knows for certain, and no one ever knew. But five or six months later, all the town was talking, with intense and sincere indignation, of Lizaveta's condition, and trying to find out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg105"></a> who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Then suddenly a terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of that drunken band five had left the town and the only one still among us was an elderly and much respected civil councilor, the father of grown-up daughters, who could hardly have spread the tale, even if there had been any foundation for it. But rumor pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing at him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would not have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he was proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle of the officials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He provoked quarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded in bringing some people round to his side. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's the wench's own fault,&#8221;</span> he asserted, and the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict, who had escaped from prison and whose name was well known to us, as he had hidden in our town. This conjecture sounded plausible, for it was remembered that Karp had been in the neighborhood just at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three people. But this affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular sympathy from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. A well-to-do merchant's widow named Kondratyev arranged to take her into her house at the end of April, meaning not to let her go out until after the confinement. They kept a constant watch over her, but in spite of their vigilance she escaped on the very last day, and made her way into Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. How, in her condition, she managed to climb over the high, strong fence remained a mystery. Some maintained that she must have been lifted over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The most likely explanation is that it happened naturally&#8212;that Lizaveta, accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had leapt down, injuring herself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;A child of God&#8212;an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg106"></a> orphan is akin to all,&#8221;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil's son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother's nickname.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch's second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers' attention so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00020"><span class="c9">Chapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart&#8212;In Verse</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command his father shouted to him from the carriage. But in spite of his uneasiness he did not stand still. That was not his way. He went at once to the kitchen to find out what his father had been doing above. Then he set off, trusting that on the way he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting him. I hasten to add that his father's shouts, commanding him to return home <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;with his mattress and pillow&#8221;</span> did not frighten him in the least. He understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;a flourish&#8221;</span> to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in our town who was celebrating his name-day with a party of friends, getting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his own crockery and furniture and tore his own and his wife's clothes, and finally broke his windows, all for the sake of effect. Next day, of course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him go back to the monastery <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg107"></a> next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he was fully persuaded that his father might hurt any one else, but would not hurt him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him. This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he went his way without hesitation, relying on it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him, and worried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was the fear of a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him in the note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to come and see her about something. This request and the necessity of going had at once aroused an uneasy feeling in his heart, and this feeling had grown more and more painful all the morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father Superior's. He was not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak of and what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as a woman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life, from early childhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with women. He was afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He had been afraid of her from the first time he saw her. He had only seen her two or three times, and had only chanced to say a few words to her. He thought of her as a beautiful, proud, imperious girl. It was not her beauty which troubled him, but something else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased the apprehension itself. The girl's aims were of the noblest, he knew that. She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity, though he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, a shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a friend, with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father. Dmitri he was even more certain not to find there, and he had a foreboding of the reason. And so his conversation would be with her alone. He had a great longing to run and see his brother Dmitri before that fateful interview. Without showing him the letter, he could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way off, and he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a minute, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg108"></a> he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid and accustomed gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in the direction of his terrible lady.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then across the market-place, it was a long way round. Though our town is small, it is scattered, and the houses are far apart. And meanwhile his father was expecting him, and perhaps had not yet forgotten his command. He might be unreasonable, and so he had to make haste to get there and back. So he decided to take a short cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the ground. This meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing other people's back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greeted him. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He had to pass the garden adjoining his father's, and belonging to a little tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of this house, as Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with her daughter, who had been a genteel maid-servant in generals' families in Petersburg. Now she had been at home a year, looking after her sick mother. She always dressed up in fine clothes, though her old mother and she had sunk into such poverty that they went every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and bread, which Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came up for soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even had a long train&#8212;a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin, who always knew everything that was going on in the town. He had forgotten it as soon as he heard it, but now, on reaching the garden, he remembered the dress with the train, raised his head, which had been bowed in thought, and came upon something quite unexpected.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something, was leaning forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously afraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha ran up to the hurdle.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,&#8221;</span> Mitya said in a joyful, hurried whisper. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Climb in here quickly! How splendid that you've come! I was just thinking of you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg109"></a> the hurdle. Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help him jump. Tucking up his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle with the agility of a bare-legged street urchin.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well done! Now come along,&#8221;</span> said Mitya in an enthusiastic whisper.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Where?&#8221;</span> whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself in a deserted garden with no one near but themselves. The garden was small, but the house was at least fifty paces away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's no one here. Why do you whisper?&#8221;</span> asked Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!&#8221;</span> cried Dmitri at the top of his voice. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here in secret, and on the watch. I'll explain later on, but, knowing it's a secret, I began whispering like a fool, when there's no need. Let us go. Over there. Till then be quiet. I want to kiss you.</span></p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Glory to God in the world,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Glory to God in me ...</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">I was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees only along the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees, maples, limes and birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an empty grass space, from which several hundredweight of hay was carried in the summer. The garden was let out for a few roubles for the summer. There were also plantations of raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a kitchen garden had been planted lately near the house.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Dmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden. There, in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant, elder, snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green summer-house, blackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work, but there was still a roof which could give shelter. God knows when this summer-house was built. There was a tradition that it had been put up some fifty years before by a retired colonel called von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. It was all in decay, the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the woodwork smelled musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden table fixed in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which it was still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg110"></a> brother's exhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the table.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's brandy,&#8221;</span> Mitya laughed. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I see your look: <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;He's drinking again!&#8217;</span> Distrust the apparition.</span></p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">
<div class="tei tei-lg c22">
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">Distrust the worthless, lying crowd,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l c21"><span class="c20">And lay aside thy doubts.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">I'm not drinking, I'm only <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;indulging,&#8217;</span> as that pig, your Rakitin, says. He'll be a civil councilor one day, but he'll always talk about <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;indulging.&#8217;</span> Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press you to my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world&#8212;in reality&#8212;in re-al-i-ty&#8212;(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No one but you and one <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;jade&#8217;</span> I have fallen in love with, to my ruin. But being in love doesn't mean loving. You may be in love with a woman and yet hate her. Remember that! I can talk about it gayly still. Sit down here by the table and I'll sit beside you and look at you, and go on talking. You shall keep quiet and I'll go on talking, for the time has come. But on reflection, you know, I'd better speak quietly, for here&#8212;here&#8212;you can never tell what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as they say, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the story will be continued.&#8217;</span> Why have I been longing for you? Why have I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It's five days since I've cast anchor here.) Because it's only to you I can tell everything; because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow I shall fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending and beginning. Have you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling down a precipice into a pit? That's just how I'm falling, but not in a dream. And I'm not afraid, and don't you be afraid. At least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it. It's not enjoyment though, but ecstasy. Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish spirit&#8212;whatever it is! Let us praise nature: you see what sunshine, how clear the sky is, the leaves are all green, it's still summer; four o'clock in the afternoon and the stillness! Where were you going?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna's first.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg111"></a> waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with father. To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Did you really mean to send me?&#8221;</span> cried Alyosha with a distressed expression.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She's asked you, written to you a letter or something, that's why you're going to her? You wouldn't be going except for that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Here is her note.&#8221;</span> Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya looked through it quickly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him by the back-way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in heaven I've told already; but I want to tell an angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that some one above me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them, and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and says, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Do this for me&#8217;</span>&#8212;some favor never asked before that could only be asked on one's deathbed&#8212;would that other refuse, if he were a friend or a brother?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,&#8221;</span> said Alyosha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Make haste! H'm!... Don't be in a hurry, Alyosha, you hurry and worry yourself. There's no need to hurry now. Now the world has taken a new turning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can't understand ecstasy. But what am I saying to him? As though you didn't understand it. What an ass I am! What am I saying? <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Be noble, O man!&#8217;</span>&#8212;who says that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Alyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed, his work lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg112"></a> with his elbow on the table and his head in his hand. Both were silent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alyosha,&#8221;</span> said Mitya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;you're the only one who won't laugh. I should like to begin&#8212;my confession&#8212;with Schiller's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Hymn to Joy</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">An die Freude</span></span>! I don't know German, I only know it's called that. Don't think I'm talking nonsense because I'm drunk. I'm not a bit drunk. Brandy's all very well, but I need two bottles to make me drunk:</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">But I've not drunk a quarter of a bottle, and I'm not Silenus.

<p class="tei tei-p c3">Mitya broke into sobs and seized Alyosha's hand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My dear, my dear, in degradation, in degradation now, too. There's a terrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible lot of trouble. Don't think I'm only a brute in an officer's uniform, wallowing in dirt and drink. I hardly think of anything but of that degraded man&#8212;if only I'm not lying. I pray God I'm not lying and showing off. I think about that man because I am that man myself.</span></p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote c23">

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I don't kiss her. I don't cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a peasant or a shepherd? I go on and I don't know whether I'm going to shame or to light and joy. That's the trouble, for everything in the world is a riddle! And whenever I've happened to sink into the vilest degradation (and it's always been happening) I always read that poem about Ceres and man. Has it reformed me? Never! For I'm a Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit, I go headlong with my heels up, and am pleased to be falling in that degrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in the very depths of that degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be accursed. Let me be vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my God is shrouded. Though I may be following the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and I love Thee, and I feel the joy without which the world cannot stand.</p>

Tempests, because sensual lust is a tempest&#8212;worse than a tempest! Beauty is a terrible and awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never can be fathomed, for God sets us nothing but riddles. Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side by side. I am not a cultivated man, brother, but I've thought a lot about this. It's terrible what mysteries there are! Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as we can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can't endure the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What's still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his days of youth and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too broad, indeed. I'd have him narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it! What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart. Is there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg115"></a> beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man. But a man always talks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to facts.&#8221;</span></p>
