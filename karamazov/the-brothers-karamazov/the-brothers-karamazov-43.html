<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00077"><span class="c9">Chapter I. Kolya Krassotkin</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It was the beginning of November. There had been a hard frost, eleven degrees R&#233;aumur, without snow, but a little dry snow had fallen on the frozen ground during the night, and a keen dry wind was lifting and blowing it along the dreary streets of our town, especially about the market-place. It was a dull morning, but the snow had ceased.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Not far from the market-place, close to Plotnikov's shop, there stood a small house, very clean both without and within. It belonged to Madame Krassotkin, the widow of a former provincial secretary, who had been dead for fourteen years. His widow, still a nice-looking woman of thirty-two, was living in her neat little house on her private means. She lived in respectable seclusion; she was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition. She was about eighteen at the time of her husband's death; she had been married only a year and had just borne him a son. From the day of his death she had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her precious treasure, her boy Kolya. Though she had loved him passionately those fourteen years, he had caused her far more suffering than happiness. She had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day, afraid he would fall ill, would catch cold, do something naughty, climb on a chair and fall off it, and so on and so on. When Kolya began going to school, the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him so as to help him, and go through his lessons with him. She hastened to make the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives, even made up to Kolya's schoolfellows, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page579"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg579"></a> and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving Kolya from being teased, laughed at, or beaten by them. She went so far that the boys actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him with being a <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;mother's darling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;tremendously strong,&#8221;</span> as was rumored in his class, and soon proved to be the fact; he was agile, strong-willed, and of an audacious and enterprising temper. He was good at lessons, and there was a rumor in the school that he could beat the teacher, Dardanelov, at arithmetic and universal history. Though he looked down upon every one, he was a good comrade and not supercilious. He accepted his schoolfellows' respect as his due, but was friendly with them. Above all, he knew where to draw the line. He could restrain himself on occasion, and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach of discipline. But he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion as the smallest boy in the school, and not so much for the sake of mischief as for creating a sensation, inventing something, something effective and conspicuous. He was extremely vain. He knew how to make even his mother give way to him; he was almost despotic in his control of her. She gave way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years. The one thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love for her. She was always fancying that Kolya was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;unfeeling&#8221;</span> to her, and at times, dissolving into hysterical tears, she used to reproach him with his coldness. The boy disliked this, and the more demonstrations of feeling were demanded of him the more he seemed intentionally to avoid them. Yet it was not intentional on his part but instinctive&#8212;it was his character. His mother was mistaken; he was very fond of her. He only disliked <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;sheepish sentimentality,&#8221;</span> as he expressed it in his schoolboy language.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been his father's. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read several of them by himself. His mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book instead of going to play. And in that way Kolya read some things unsuitable for his age.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Though the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page580"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg580"></a> mischief, he had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious alarm. It is true there was nothing vicious in what he did, but a wild mad recklessness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">It happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the mother and son went to another district, forty-five miles away, to spend a week with a distant relation, whose husband was an official at the railway station (the very station, the nearest one to our town, from which a month later Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow). There Kolya began by carefully investigating every detail connected with the railways, knowing that he could impress his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly acquired knowledge. But there happened to be some other boys in the place with whom he soon made friends. Some of them were living at the station, others in the neighborhood; there were six or seven of them, all between twelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our town. The boys played together, and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolya's stay at the station, a mad bet was made by the foolish boys. Kolya, who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence, was moved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie down between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train was due, and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over him at full speed. It is true they made a preliminary investigation, from which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the rails that the train could pass over without touching, but to lie there was no joke! Kolya maintained stoutly that he would. At first they laughed at him, called him a little liar, a braggart, but that only egged him on. What piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses at him too superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him as <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;a small boy,&#8221;</span> not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurable insult.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the station, so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the station. The boys assembled. It was a pitch-dark night without a moon. At the time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails. The five others who had taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts beating with suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page581"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg581"></a> heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station. Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as it approached.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Run, run away from the rails,&#8221;</span> the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes, breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted up and flew past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving. They began pulling at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got up and walked away without a word. Then he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible to frighten them, but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as he confessed long after to his mother. In this way his reputation as <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;a desperate character,&#8221;</span> was established for ever. He returned home to the station as white as a sheet. Next day he had a slight attack of nervous fever, but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself. The incident did not become known at once, but when they came back to the town it penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of the masters. But then Kolya's mother hastened to entreat the masters on her boy's behalf, and in the end Dardanelov, a respected and influential teacher, exerted himself in his favor, and the affair was ignored.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately in love with Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had once already, about a year previously, ventured, trembling with fear and the delicacy of his sentiments, to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage. But she refused him resolutely, feeling that to accept him would be an act of treachery to her son, though Dardanelov had, to judge from certain mysterious symptoms, reason for believing that he was not an object of aversion to the charming but too chaste and tender-hearted widow. Kolya's mad prank seemed to have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded for his intercession by a suggestion of hope. The suggestion, it is true, was a faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacy that it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly happy. He was fond of the boy, though he would have felt it beneath him to try and win him over, and was severe and strict with him in class. Kolya, too, kept him at a respectful distance. He learned his lessons perfectly; he was second in his class, was reserved with Dardanelov, and the whole class firmly believed that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page582"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg582"></a> Kolya was so good at universal history that he could <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;beat&#8221;</span> even Dardanelov. Kolya did indeed ask him the question, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who founded Troy?&#8221;</span> to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring to the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the period, to the mythical legends. But the question, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who had founded Troy?&#8221;</span> that is, what individuals, he could not answer, and even for some reason regarded the question as idle and frivolous. But the boys remained convinced that Dardanelov did not know who founded Troy. Kolya had read of the founders of Troy in Smaragdov, whose history was among the books in his father's bookcase. In the end all the boys became interested in the question, who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tell his secret, and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">After the incident on the railway a certain change came over Kolya's attitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame Krassotkin) heard of her son's exploit, she almost went out of her mind with horror. She had such terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting with intervals for several days, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at last, promised on his honor that such pranks should never be repeated. He swore on his knees before the holy image, and swore by the memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkin's instance, and the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;manly&#8221;</span> Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six. And all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other's arms sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;unfeeling&#8221;</span> as before, but he had become more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Six weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which even brought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was a scrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did not, as it turned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in it. But of this later. His mother still fretted and trembled, but the more uneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov. It must be noted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelov's heart and, of course, despised him profoundly for his <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;feelings&#8221;</span>; he had in the past been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother, hinting vaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the time of the railway incident his behavior in this respect also was changed; he did not allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page583"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg583"></a> respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the sensitive woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude. But at the slightest mention of Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolya's presence, she would flush as pink as a rose. At such moments Kolya would either stare out of the window scowling, or would investigate the state of his boots, or would shout angrily for <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perezvon,&#8221;</span> the big, shaggy, mangy dog, which he had picked up a month before, brought home, and kept for some reason secretly indoors, not showing him to any of his schoolfellows. He bullied him frightfully, teaching him all sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog howled for him whenever he was absent at school, and when he came in, whined with delight, rushed about as if he were crazy, begged, lay down on the ground pretending to be dead, and so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he had taught him, not at the word of command, but simply from the zeal of his excited and grateful heart.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">I have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the boy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the son of Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending his father when the schoolboys jeered at him, shouting the nickname <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;wisp of tow.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00078"><span class="c9">Chapter II. Children</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">And so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November, Kolya Krassotkin was sitting at home. It was Sunday and there was no school. It had just struck eleven, and he particularly wanted to go out <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;on very urgent business,&#8221;</span> but he was left alone in charge of the house, for it so happened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden and singular event. Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms, separated from the rest of the house by a passage, to a doctor's wife with her two small children. This lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a great friend of hers. Her husband, the doctor, had taken his departure twelve months before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and for the last six months she had not heard a word from him. Had it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page584"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg584"></a> not been for her friendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was some consolation to the forsaken lady, she would certainly have completely dissolved away in tears. And now, to add to her misfortunes, Katerina, her only servant, was suddenly moved the evening before to announce, to her mistress's amazement, that she proposed to bring a child into the world before morning. It seemed almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticed the probability of it before. The astounded doctor's wife decided to move Katerina while there was still time to an establishment in the town kept by a midwife for such emergencies. As she set great store by her servant, she promptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her. By the morning all Madame Krassotkin's friendly sympathy and energy were called upon to render assistance and appeal to some one for help in the case.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">So both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins' servant, Agafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus left for a time to protect and look after <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the kids,&#8221;</span> that is, the son and daughter of the doctor's wife, who were left alone. Kolya was not afraid of taking care of the house, besides he had Perezvon, who had been told to lie flat, without moving, under the bench in the hall. Every time Kolya, walking to and fro through the rooms, came into the hall, the dog shook his head and gave two loud and insinuating taps on the floor with his tail, but alas! the whistle did not sound to release him. Kolya looked sternly at the luckless dog, who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one thing that troubled Kolya was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the kids.&#8221;</span> He looked, of course, with the utmost scorn on Katerina's unexpected adventure, but he was very fond of the bereaved <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;kiddies,&#8221;</span> and had already taken them a picture-book. Nastya, the elder, a girl of eight, could read, and Kostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fond of being read to by her. Krassotkin could, of course, have provided more diverting entertainment for them. He could have made them stand side by side and played soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the house. He had done so more than once before and was not above doing it, so much so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses with the little lodgers at home, prancing with his head on one side like a trace-horse. But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust, pointing out that to play horses with boys of one's own age, boys of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page585"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg585"></a> thirteen, would certainly be disgraceful <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;at this date,&#8221;</span> but that he did it for the sake of <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the kids&#8221;</span> because he liked them, and no one had a right to call him to account for his feelings. The two <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;kids&#8221;</span> adored him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very important business of his own before him, something almost mysterious. Meanwhile time was passing and Agafya, with whom he could have left the children, would not come back from market. He had several times already crossed the passage, opened the door of the lodgers' room and looked anxiously at <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the kids&#8221;</span> who were sitting over the book, as he had bidden them. Every time he opened the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would do something delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and did not go in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all, that if that <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;damned&#8221;</span> Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go out without waiting for her, making <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the kids&#8221;</span> promise, of course, to be brave when he was away, not to be naughty, not to cry from fright. With this idea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar, slung his satchel round his shoulder, and, regardless of his mother's constantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in such cold weather, he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall and went out with only his boots on. Perezvon, seeing him in his outdoor clothes, began tapping nervously, yet vigorously, on the floor with his tail. Twitching all over, he even uttered a plaintive whine. But Kolya, seeing his dog's passionate excitement, decided that it was a breach of discipline, kept him for another minute under the bench, and only when he had opened the door into the passage, whistled for him. The dog leapt up like a mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kolya opened the door to peep at <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;the kids.&#8221;</span> They were both sitting as before at the table, not reading but warmly disputing about something. The children often argued together about various exciting problems of life, and Nastya, being the elder, always got the best of it. If Kostya did not agree with her, he almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and his verdict was regarded as infallible by both of them. This time the <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;kids'&#8221;</span> discussion rather <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page586"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg586"></a> interested Krassotkin, and he stood still in the passage to listen. The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute with even greater energy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall never, never believe,&#8221;</span> Nastya prattled, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;that the old women find babies among the cabbages in the kitchen-garden. It's winter now and there are no cabbages, and so the old woman couldn't have taken Katerina a daughter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kolya whistled to himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to those who are married.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nastya, how silly you are!&#8221;</span> he said at last, firmly and calmly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How can Katerina have a baby when she isn't married?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Nastya was exasperated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know nothing about it,&#8221;</span> she snapped irritably. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps she has a husband, only he is in prison, so now she's got a baby.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But is her husband in prison?&#8221;</span> the matter-of-fact Kostya inquired gravely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Or, I tell you what,&#8221;</span> Nastya interrupted impulsively, completely rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;She hasn't a husband, you are right there, but she wants to be married, and so she's been thinking of getting married, and thinking and thinking of it till now she's got it, that is, not a husband but a baby.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, perhaps so,&#8221;</span> Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But you didn't say so before. So how could I tell?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, kiddies,&#8221;</span> said Kolya, stepping into the room. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're terrible people, I see.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And Perezvon with you!&#8221;</span> grinned Kostya, and began snapping his fingers and calling Perezvon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am in a difficulty, kids,&#8221;</span> Krassotkin began solemnly, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;and you must help me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has not turned up till now, that's certain. I must go out. Will you let me go?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces showed signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You won't be naughty while I am gone? You won't climb on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page587"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg587"></a> the cupboard and break your legs? You won't be frightened alone and cry?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A look of profound despondency came into the children's faces.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The children's faces instantly brightened. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Show us the cannon,&#8221;</span> said Kostya, beaming all over.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little bronze cannon stood it on the table.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it's on wheels.&#8221;</span> He rolled the toy on along the table. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And it can be fired off, too. It can be loaded with shot and fired off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And it could kill any one?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It can kill any one; you've only got to aim at anybody,&#8221;</span> and Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put, where the shot should be rolled in, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and told them that it kicked when it was fired.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The children listened with intense interest. What particularly struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And have you got any powder?&#8221;</span> Nastya inquired.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Show us the powder, too,&#8221;</span> she drawled with a smile of entreaty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask containing a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in a screw of paper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm of his hand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One has to be careful there's no fire about, or it would blow up and kill us all,&#8221;</span> Krassotkin warned them sensationally.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that only intensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And does the shot burn?&#8221;</span> he inquired.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, it doesn't.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Give me a little shot,&#8221;</span> he asked in an imploring voice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don't show it to your mother till I come back, or she'll be sure to think it's gunpowder, and will die of fright and give you a thrashing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Mother never does whip us,&#8221;</span> Nastya observed at once.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page588"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg588"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don't you ever deceive your mother except just this once, until I come back. And so, kiddies, can I go out? You won't be frightened and cry when I'm gone?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We sha&#8212;all cry,&#8221;</span> drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,&#8221;</span> Nastya chimed in with timid haste.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years! There's no help for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I don't know how long. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!&#8221;</span> Kostya begged.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Ici</span></span>, Perezvon.&#8221;</span> And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed all his tricks.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">He was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort of lilac-gray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear was torn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind legs, lay on his back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he were dead. While this last performance was going on, the door opened and Agafya, Madame Krassotkin's servant, a stout woman of forty, marked with small-pox, appeared in the doorway. She had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand. Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return, he did not cut short the performance, and after keeping Perezvon dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dog jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only think, a dog!&#8221;</span> Agafya observed sententiously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why are you late, female?&#8221;</span> asked Krassotkin sternly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Brat?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I'm late; if I'm late, you may be sure I have good reason,&#8221;</span> muttered Agafya, busying herself about the stove, without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice. She seemed quite pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Listen, you frivolous young woman,&#8221;</span> Krassotkin began, getting up from the sofa, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;can you swear by all you hold sacred in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page589"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg589"></a> world and something else besides, that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence? I am going out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And what am I going to swear for?&#8221;</span> laughed Agafya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I shall look after them without that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan't go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, don't then. What does it matter to me? It's cold out; stay at home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Kids,&#8221;</span> Kolya turned to the children, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;this woman will stay with you till I come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to have been back long ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You'll give them something, Agafya, won't you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That I can do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you, granny,&#8221;</span> he added gravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I hope you'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your old woman's nonsense about Katerina. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Ici</span></span>, Perezvon!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Get along with you!&#8221;</span> retorted Agafya, really angry this time. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ridiculous boy! You want a whipping for saying such things, that's what you want!&#8221;</span></p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head c18" id="dlepubid00079"><span class="c9">Chapter III. The Schoolboy</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">But Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he went out at the gate he looked round him, shrugged up his shoulders, and saying <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It is freezing,&#8221;</span> went straight along the street and turned off to the right towards the market-place. When he reached the last house but one before the market-place he stopped at the gate, pulled a whistle out of his pocket, and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal. He had not to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven, wearing a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to meet him. This was Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class (two classes below Kolya Krassotkin), son of a well-to-do official. Apparently he was forbidden by his parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known to be a desperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page590"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg590"></a> out on the sly. He was&#8212;if the reader has not forgotten&#8212;one of the group of boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha. He was the one who told Alyosha Karamazov about Ilusha.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,&#8221;</span> said Smurov stolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am late,&#8221;</span> answered Krassotkin. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I was detained by circumstances. You won't be thrashed for coming with me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Come, I say, I'm never thrashed! And you've got Perezvon with you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're taking him, too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's impossible. Zhutchka's non-existent. Zhutchka is lost in the mists of obscurity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah! couldn't we do this?&#8221;</span> Smurov suddenly stood still. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You see Ilusha says that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky-looking dog like Perezvon. Couldn't you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he might believe you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Boy, shun a lie, that's one thing; even with a good object&#8212;that's another. Above all, I hope you've not told them anything about my coming.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you won't comfort him with Perezvon,&#8221;</span> said Smurov, with a sigh. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know his father, the captain, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;the wisp of tow,&#8217;</span> told us that he was going to bring him a real mastiff pup, with a black nose, to-day. He thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but I doubt it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And how is Ilusha?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, he is bad, very bad! I believe he's in consumption: he is quite conscious, but his breathing! His breathing's gone wrong. The other day he asked to have his boots on to be led round the room. He tried to walk, but he couldn't stand. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Ah, I told you before, father,&#8217;</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;that those boots were no good. I could never walk properly in them.&#8217;</span> He fancied it was his boots that made him stagger, but it was simply weakness, really. He won't live another week. Herzenstube is looking after him. Now they are rich again&#8212;they've got heaps of money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;They are rogues.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page591"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg591"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Who are rogues?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of course, individually. I don't believe in medicine. It's a useless institution. I mean to go into all that. But what's that sentimentality you've got up there? The whole class seems to be there every day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not the whole class: it's only ten of our fellows who go to see him every day. There's nothing in that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What I don't understand in all this is the part that Alexey Karamazov is taking in it. His brother's going to be tried to-morrow or next day for such a crime, and yet he has so much time to spend on sentimentality with boys.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There's no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now to make it up with Ilusha.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Make it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow no one to analyze my actions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that you are coming. Why was it, why was it you wouldn't come all this time?&#8221;</span> Smurov cried with sudden warmth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;My dear boy, that's my business, not yours. I am going of myself because I choose to, but you've all been hauled there by Alexey Karamazov&#8212;there's a difference, you know. And how do you know? I may not be going to make it up at all. It's a stupid expression.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's not Karamazov at all; it's not his doing. Our fellows began going there of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov at first. And there's been nothing of that sort&#8212;no silliness. First one went, and then another. His father was awfully pleased to see us. You know he will simply go out of his mind if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha's dying. And he seems so glad we've made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that was all. He just asks and says no more. His father will go out of his mind or hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a very decent man. We made a mistake then. It's all the fault of that murderer who beat him then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Karamazov's a riddle to me all the same. I might have made his acquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some cases. Besides, I have a theory about him which I must work out and verify.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page592"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg592"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent. Smurov, of course, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on a level with him. Now he was tremendously interested at Kolya's saying that he was <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;going of himself&#8221;</span> to see Ilusha. He felt that there must be some mystery in Kolya's suddenly taking it into his head to go to him that day. They crossed the market-place, in which at that hour were many loaded wagons from the country and a great number of live fowls. The market women were selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths. These Sunday markets were na&#239;vely called <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;fairs&#8221;</span> in the town, and there were many such fairs in the year.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one side, then the other. When he met other dogs they zealously smelt each other over according to the rules of canine etiquette.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,&#8221;</span> said Kolya suddenly. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet? It seems to be a law of their nature.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes; it's a funny habit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, it's not funny; you are wrong there. There's nothing funny in nature, however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices. If dogs could reason and criticize us they'd be sure to find just as much that would be funny to them, if not far more, in the social relations of men, their masters&#8212;far more, indeed. I repeat that, because I am convinced that there is far more foolishness among us. That's Rakitin's idea&#8212;a remarkable idea. I am a Socialist, Smurov.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And what is a Socialist?&#8221;</span> asked Smurov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That's when all are equal and all have property in common, there are no marriages, and every one has any religion and laws he likes best, and all the rest of it. You are not old enough to understand that yet. It's cold, though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer just now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we don't feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden frost of twelve degrees, especially when there is not much snow. It's because people are not used to it. Everything is habit with men, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page593"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg593"></a> everything even in their social and political relations. Habit is the great motive-power. What a funny-looking peasant!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance in a long sheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping together his hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them. His long fair beard was all white with frost.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That peasant's beard's frozen,&#8221;</span> Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice as he passed him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Lots of people's beards are frozen,&#8221;</span> the peasant replied, calmly and sententiously.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't provoke him,&#8221;</span> observed Smurov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's all right; he won't be cross; he's a nice fellow. Good-by, Matvey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Is your name Matvey?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes. Didn't you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No, I didn't. It was a guess.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You don't say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You get whipped, I expect?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nothing to speak of&#8212;sometimes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Does it hurt?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, yes, it does.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ech, what a life!&#8221;</span> The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by, Matvey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by. You are a nice chap, that you are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The boys went on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That was a nice peasant,&#8221;</span> Kolya observed to Smurov. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I like talking to the peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?&#8221;</span> asked Smurov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I had to say that to please him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You know, Smurov, I don't like being asked the same thing twice. I like people to understand at the first word. Some things can't be explained. According to a peasant's notions, schoolboys are whipped, and must be whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page594"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg594"></a> whipped? And if I were to tell him we are not, he'd be disappointed. But you don't understand that. One has to know how to talk to the peasants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Only don't tease them, please, or you'll get into another scrape as you did about that goose.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So you're afraid?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't laugh, Kolya. Of course I'm afraid. My father would be awfully cross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Don't be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo, Natasha!&#8221;</span> he shouted to a market woman in one of the booths.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,&#8221;</span> the middle-aged market woman shouted at him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I am so glad it's Marya. Good-by!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I'm in a hurry. I can't stay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.&#8221;</span> Kolya waved his hand at her, as though she had attacked him and not he her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I've nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you impudent young monkey. I didn't say anything,&#8221;</span> bawled Marya. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You want a whipping, that's what you want, you saucy jackanapes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">There was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her. Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close by. He was a young man, not a native of the town, with dark, curly hair and a long, pale face, marked with smallpox. He wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap, and looked like a merchant's clerk. He was in a state of stupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know you!&#8221;</span> he cried angrily, <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have had a row with the man. But he had been in so many rows in the street that he could hardly remember them all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you?&#8221;</span> he asked sarcastically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know you! I know you!&#8221;</span> the man repeated idiotically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;So much the better for you. Well, it's time I was going. Good-by!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are at your saucy pranks again?&#8221;</span> cried the man. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You are at your saucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page595"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg595"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks again,&#8221;</span> said Kolya, standing still and scanning him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not my business?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;No; it's not your business.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's Trifon Nikititch's business, not yours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What Trifon Nikititch?&#8221;</span> asked the youth, staring with loutish amazement at Kolya, but still as angry as ever.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Kolya scanned him gravely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Have you been to the Church of the Ascension?&#8221;</span> he suddenly asked him, with stern emphasis.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven't,&#8221;</span> said the young man, somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you know Sabaneyev?&#8221;</span> Kolya went on even more emphatically and even more severely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What Sabaneyev? No, I don't know him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well then you can go to the devil,&#8221;</span> said Kolya, cutting short the conversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not even know Sabaneyev.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?&#8221;</span> the young man recovered from his momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</span> He turned to the market women with a silly stare.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The women laughed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You can never tell what he's after,&#8221;</span> said one of them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What Sabaneyev is it he's talking about?&#8221;</span> the young man repeated, still furious and brandishing his right arm.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, that's who it must be,&#8221;</span> one of the women suggested.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The young man stared at her wildly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;For the Kuzmitchovs?&#8221;</span> repeated another woman. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But his name wasn't Trifon. His name's Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch, so it can't be the same.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, it's Tchizhov,&#8221;</span> put in suddenly a third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening gravely. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Alexey Ivanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page596"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg596"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not a doubt about it, it's Tchizhov,&#8221;</span> a fourth woman emphatically confirmed the statement.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The bewildered youth gazed from one to another.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;But what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?&#8221;</span> he cried almost in desperation. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;&#8201;<span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;Do you know Sabaneyev?&#8217;</span> says he. And who the devil's to know who is Sabaneyev?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You're a senseless fellow. I tell you it's not Sabaneyev, but Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, that's who it is!&#8221;</span> one of the women shouted at him impressively.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;That tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And what's your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How can I tell what he's to do with you?&#8221;</span> put in another. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You ought to know yourself what you want with him, if you make such a clamor about him. He spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you stupid. Don't you really know him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Know whom?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Tchizhov.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I'll give him a hiding, that I will. He was laughing at me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one. You are a fool, that's what you are!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman. I'll give the boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing at me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off, marching along with a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him, looking round at the shouting group far behind. He too was in high spirits, though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya's company.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;What Sabaneyev did you mean?&#8221;</span> he asked Kolya, foreseeing what his answer would be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How do I know? Now there'll be a hubbub among them all day. I like to stir up fools in every class of society. There's another blockhead, that peasant there. You know, they say <span class="tei tei-q">&#8216;there's no one stupider than a stupid Frenchman,&#8217;</span> but a stupid Russian shows it in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page597"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg597"></a> his face just as much. Can't you see it all over his face that he is a fool, that peasant, eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Let him alone, Kolya. Let's go on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning, peasant!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled beard, who was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy. He seemed not quite sober.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,&#8221;</span> he said deliberately in reply.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;And if I am?&#8221;</span> laughed Kolya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, a joke's a joke. Laugh away. I don't mind. There's no harm in a joke.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Well, God forgive you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Do you forgive me, too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I quite forgive you. Go along.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I say, you seem a clever peasant.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Cleverer than you,&#8221;</span> the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the same gravity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221;</span> said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It's true, though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Perhaps it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;It is, brother.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by, peasant!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Good-by!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;There are all sorts of peasants,&#8221;</span> Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief silence. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;How could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am always ready to recognize intelligence in the peasantry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">In the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. The boys made haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov's lodging, a considerable distance, quickly and almost in silence. Twenty paces from the house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on ahead and ask Karamazov to come out to him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;One must sniff round a bit first,&#8221;</span> he observed to Smurov.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;Why ask him to come out?&#8221;</span> Smurov protested. <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;You go in; they will be awfully glad to see you. What's the sense of making friends in the frost out here?&#8221;</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page598"></span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg598"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;I know why I want to see him out here in the frost,&#8221;</span> Kolya cut him short in the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with <span class="tei tei-q">&#8220;small boys,&#8221;</span> and Smurov ran to do his bidding.</p>
