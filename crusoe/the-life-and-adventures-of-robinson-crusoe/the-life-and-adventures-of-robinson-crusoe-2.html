<p><i>Dec</i>. 11.&#8212;This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards across over each post; this I finished the next day; and setting more posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured, and the posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off the house.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 17.&#8212;From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up that could be hung up; and now I began to be in some order within doors.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 20.&#8212;Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me; also, I made me another table.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 24.&#8212;Much rain all night and all day.&#160; No stirring out.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 25.&#8212;Rain all day.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 26.&#8212;No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and pleasanter.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 27.&#8212;Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I caught it and led it home in a string; when I had it at home, I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.</p>
<p><i>N.B.</i>&#8212;I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as ever; but, by my nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not go away.&#160; This was the first time that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food when my powder and shot was all spent.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 28,29,30,31.&#8212;Great heats, and no breeze, so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food; this time I spent in putting all my things in order within doors.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 1.&#8212;Very hot still: but I went abroad early and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day.&#160; This evening, going farther into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I found there were plenty of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.</p>
<p><i>Jan.</i> 2.&#8212;Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, and set him upon the goats, but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.</p>
<p><i>Jan.</i> 3.&#8212;I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.</p>
<p><i>N.B.</i>&#8212;This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said in the journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time than from the 2nd of January to the 14th of April working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being a half-circle from one place in the rock to another place, about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre behind it.</p>
<p>All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour everything was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods and driving them into the ground; for I made them much bigger than I needed to have done.</p>
<p>When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced, with a turf wall raised up close to it, I perceived myself that if any people were to come on shore there, they would not perceive anything like a habitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable occasion.</p>
<p>During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every day when the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons, which build, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them; however, I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones, which were very good meat.&#160; And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make; as, indeed, with some of them it was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped.&#160; I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; but I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them, though I spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or join the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water; so I gave that also over.&#160; In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o&#8217;clock, I was obliged to go to bed.&#160; I remembered the lump of beeswax with which I made candles in my African adventure; but I had none of that now; the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear, steady light, like a candle.&#160; In the middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my things, I found a little bag which, as I hinted before, had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry&#8212;not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon.&#160; The little remainder of corn that had been in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of corn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock.</p>
<p>It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that I had thrown anything there, when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European&#8212;nay, as our English barley.</p>
<p>It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my thoughts on this occasion.&#160; I had hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen me otherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God, without so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these things, or His order in governing events for the world.&#160; But after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me strangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously caused His grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable place.</p>
<p>This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa when I was ashore there.</p>
<p>I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my support, but not doubting that there was more in the place, I went all over that part of the island, where I had been before, peering in every corner, and under every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find any.&#160; At last it occurred to my thoughts that I shook a bag of chickens&#8217; meat out in that place; and then the wonder began to cease; and I must confess my religious thankfulness to God&#8217;s providence began to abate, too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what was common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the work of Providence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.</p>
<p>I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their season, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with bread.&#160; But it was not till the fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost all that I sowed the first season by not observing the proper time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least not as it would have done; of which in its place.</p>
<p>Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to the same purpose&#8212;to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it without baking, though I did that also after some time.</p>
<p>But to return to my Journal.</p>
<p>I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of my habitation.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 16.&#8212;I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside.&#160; This was a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.</p>
<p>The very next day after this wall was finished I had almost had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed.&#160; The case was thus: As I was busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful, surprising thing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner.&#160; I was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what was really the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was fallen in, as some of it had done before: and for fear I should be buried in it I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll down upon me.&#160; I had no sooner stepped do ground, than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes&#8217; distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life.&#160; I perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.</p>
<p>I was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like, nor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or stupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock awakened me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror; and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.</p>
<p>After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do.&#160; All this while I had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but the common &#8220;Lord have mercy upon me!&#8221; and when it was over that went away too.</p>
<p>While I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as if it would rain.&#160; Soon after that the wind arose by little and little, so that in less than half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was covered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was.&#160; This held about three hours, and then began to abate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain very hard.&#160; All this while I sat upon the ground very much terrified and dejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my cave again.&#160; With this thought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent.&#160; But the rain was so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head.&#160; This violent rain forced me to a new work&#8212;viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have flooded my cave.&#160; After I had been in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed.&#160; And now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum; which, however, I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.&#160; It continued raining all that night and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began to think of what I had best do; concluding that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open place which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men; for I concluded, if I stayed where I was, I should certainly one time or other be buried alive.</p>
<p>With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill; and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent; and I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my habitation.&#160; The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it; but still, when I looked about, and saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove.&#160; In the meantime, it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it.&#160; So with this resolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &amp;c., in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished; but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and fit to remove.&#160; This was the 21st.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 22.&#8212;The next morning I begin to consider of means to put this resolve into execution; but I was at a great loss about my tools.&#160; I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.&#160; This cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man.&#160; At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty.&#160; <i>Note</i>.&#8212;I had never seen any such thing in England, or at least, not to take notice how it was done, though since I have observed, it is very common there; besides that, my grindstone was very large and heavy.&#160; This machine cost me a full week&#8217;s work to bring it to perfection.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 28, 29.&#8212;These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing very well.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 30.&#8212;Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 1.&#8212;In the morning, looking towards the sea side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do.&#160; I examined the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00006">CHAPTER VI&#8212;ILL AND CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN</h2>
<p>When I came down to the ship I found it strangely removed.&#160; The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six feet, and the stern, which was broke in pieces and parted from the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed as it were up, and cast on one side; and the sand was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that whereas there was a great place of water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming I could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out.&#160; I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence the ship was more broke open than formerly, so many things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.</p>
<p>This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in searching whether I could make any way into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand.&#160; However, as I had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding that everything I could get from her would be of some use or other to me.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 3.&#8212;I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which I thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together, and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 4.&#8212;I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin.&#160; I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 5.&#8212;Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from the decks, which I tied together, and made to float on shore when the tide of flood came on.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 6.&#8212;Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out of her and other pieces of ironwork.&#160; Worked very hard, and came home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 7.&#8212;Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut; that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into it; but it was almost full of water and sand.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 8.&#8212;Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand.&#160; I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide.&#160; I left the iron crow in the wreck for next day.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 9.&#8212;Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but could not break them up.&#160; I felt also a roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to remove.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 10&#8211;14.&#8212;Went every day to the wreck; and got a great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundredweight of iron.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 15.&#8212;I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off the roll of lead by placing the edge of one hatchet and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 16.&#8212;It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 17.&#8212;I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 24.&#8212;Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first flowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen&#8217;s chests; but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it.&#160; I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time I had got timber and plank and ironwork enough to have built a good boat, if I had known how; and also I got, at several times and in several pieces, near one hundredweight of the sheet lead.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 16.&#8212;Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise or turtle.&#160; This was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened to be on the other side of the island, I might have had hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 17.&#8212;I spent in cooking the turtle.&#160; I found in her three-score eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 18.&#8212;Rained all day, and I stayed within.&#160; I thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly; which I knew was not usual in that latitude.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 19.&#8212;Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 20.&#8212;No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 21.&#8212;Very ill; frighted almost to death with the apprehensions of my sad condition&#8212;to be sick, and no help.&#160; Prayed to God, for the first time since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why, my thoughts being all confused.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 22.&#8212;A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions of sickness.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 23.&#8212;Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a violent headache.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 24.&#8212;Much better.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 25.&#8212;An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours; cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 26.&#8212;Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but found myself very weak.&#160; However, I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate, I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 27.&#8212;The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all day, and neither ate nor drank.&#160; I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.&#160; Prayed to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, &#8220;Lord, look upon me!&#160; Lord, pity me!&#160; Lord, have mercy upon me!&#8221;&#160; I suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours; till, the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night.&#160; When I awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty.&#160; However, as I had no water in my habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again.&#160; In this second sleep I had this terrible dream: I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground.&#160; He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe.&#160; When he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire.&#160; He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me&#8212;or I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it.&#160; All that I can say I understood was this: &#8220;Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;&#8221; at which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me.</p>
<p>No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision.&#160; I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors.&#160; Nor is it any more possible to describe the impression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.</p>
<p>I had, alas! no divine knowledge.&#160; What I had received by the good instruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation with none but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree.&#160; I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways; but a certain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me; and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our common sailors can be supposed to be; not having the least sense, either of the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to God in deliverance.</p>
<p>In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more easily believed when I shall add, that through all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as one thought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin&#8212;my rebellious behaviour against my father&#8212;or my present sins, which were great&#8212;or so much as a punishment for the general course of my wicked life.&#160; When I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what would become of me, or one wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures as cruel savages.&#160; But I was merely thoughtless of a God or a Providence, acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, and, indeed, hardly that.&#160; When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts.&#160; When, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment.&#160; I only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.</p>
<p>It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship&#8217;s crew drowned and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where it began, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful unto me.&#160; Even just the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it.&#160; Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw but a prospect of living and that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off; and I began to be very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my preservation and supply, and was far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these were thoughts which very seldom entered my head.</p>
<p>The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at first some little influence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as ever that part of the thought was removed, all the impression that was raised from it wore off also, as I have noted already.&#160; Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the impression it had made went off also.&#160; I had no more sense of God or His judgments&#8212;much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being from His hand&#8212;than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life.&#160; But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.&#160; These reflections oppressed me for the second or third day of my distemper; and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words from me like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended with desires or with hopes: it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress.&#160; My thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition raised vapours into my head with the mere apprehensions; and in these hurries of my soul I knew not what my tongue might express.&#160; But it was rather exclamation, such as, &#8220;Lord, what a miserable creature am I!&#160; If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help; and what will become of me!&#8221;&#160; Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.&#160; In this interval the good advice of my father came to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this story&#8212;viz. that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery.&#160; &#8220;Now,&#8221; said I, aloud, &#8220;my dear father&#8217;s words are come to pass; God&#8217;s justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me.&#160; I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I might have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents.&#160; I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it.&#160; I abused their help and assistance, who would have lifted me in the world, and would have made everything easy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice.&#8221;&#160; Then I cried out, &#8220;Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress.&#8221;&#160; This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many years.</p>
<p>But to return to my Journal.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 28.&#8212;Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up; and though the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague would return again the next day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and support myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I did, I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed them together.&#160; Then I got me a piece of the goat&#8217;s flesh and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little.&#160; I walked about, but was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable condition, dreading, the return of my distemper the next day.&#160; At night I made my supper of three of the turtle&#8217;s eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell, and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God&#8217;s blessing to, that I could remember, in my whole life.&#160; After I had eaten I tried to walk, but found myself so weak that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never went out without that; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth.&#160; As I sat here some such thoughts as these occurred to me: What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much?&#160; Whence is it produced?&#160; And what am I, and all the other creatures wild and tame, human and brutal?&#160; Whence are we?&#160; Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky.&#160; And who is that?&#160; Then it followed most naturally, it is God that has made all.&#160; Well, but then it came on strangely, if God has made all these things, He guides and governs them all, and all things that concern them; for the Power that could make all things must certainly have power to guide and direct them.&#160; If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of His works, either without His knowledge or appointment.</p>
<p>And if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing happens without His appointment, He has appointed all this to befall me.&#160; Nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force, that it must needs be that God had appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought into this miserable circumstance by His direction, He having the sole power, not of me only, but of everything that happened in the world.&#160; Immediately it followed: Why has God done this to me?&#160; What have I done to be thus used?&#160; My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice: &#8220;Wretch! dost <i>thou</i> ask what thou hast done?&#160; Look back upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast <i>not</i> done?&#160; Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed?&#160; Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned <i>here</i>, when all the crew perished but thyself?&#160; Dost <i>thou</i> ask, what have I done?&#8221;&#160; I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and had not a word to say&#8212;no, not to answer to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark.&#160; Now, as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought that the Brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers, and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite cured.</p>
<p>I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a cure both for soul and body.&#160; I opened the chest, and found what I looked for, the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found leisure or inclination to look into.&#160; I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.&#160; What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no: but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other.&#160; I first took a piece of leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first almost stupefied my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been much used to.&#160; Then I took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as almost for suffocation.&#160; In the interval of this operation I took up the Bible and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened the book casually, the first words that occurred to me were these, &#8220;Call on Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.&#8221;&#160; These words were very apt to my case, and made some impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being <i>delivered</i>, the word had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as the children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat, &#8220;Can God spread a table in the wilderness?&#8221; so I began to say, &#8220;Can God Himself deliver me from this place?&#8221;&#160; And as it was not for many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often.&#160; It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything in the night, and went to bed.&#160; But before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life&#8212;I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver me.&#160; After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco that I could scarcely get it down; immediately upon this I went to bed.&#160; I found presently it flew up into my head violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon the next day&#8212;nay, to this hour I am partly of opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost three the day after; for otherwise I know not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the line, I should have lost more than one day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way.&#160; Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but continued much altered for the better.&#160; This was the 29th.</p>
<p>The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too far.&#160; I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a brandgoose, and brought them home, but was not very forward to eat them; so I ate some more of the turtle&#8217;s eggs, which were very good.&#160; This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me good the day before&#8212;the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke; however, I was not so well the next day, which was the first of July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 2.&#8212;I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 3.&#8212;I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover my full strength for some weeks after.&#160; While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, &#8220;I will deliver thee&#8221;; and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had received, and I was as it were made to ask myself such questions as these&#8212;viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness&#8212;from the most distressed condition that could be, and that was so frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it?&#160; Had I done my part?&#160; God had delivered me, but I had not glorified Him&#8212;that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance?&#160; This touched my heart very much; and immediately I knelt down and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 4.&#8212;In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while every morning and every night; not tying myself to the number of chapters, but long as my thoughts should engage me.&#160; It was not long after I set seriously to this work till I found my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life.&#160; The impression of my dream revived; and the words, &#8220;All these things have not brought thee to repentance,&#8221; ran seriously through my thoughts.&#160; I was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened providentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these words: &#8220;He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and to give remission.&#8221;&#160; I threw down the book; and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, &#8220;Jesus, thou son of David!&#160; Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentance!&#8221;&#160; This was the first time I could say, in the true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the encouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I may say, I began to hope that God would hear me.</p>
<p>Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, &#8220;Call on Me, and I will deliver thee,&#8221; in a different sense from what I had ever done before; for then I had no notion of anything being called <i>deliverance</i>, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the worse sense in the world.&#160; But now I learned to take it in another sense: now I looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort.&#160; As for my solitary life, it was nothing.&#160; I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it or think of it; it was all of no consideration in comparison to this.&#160; And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from affliction.</p>
<p>But, leaving this part, I return to my Journal.</p>
<p>My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which till now I knew nothing of; also, my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself to furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make my way of living as regular as I could.</p>
<p>From the 4th of July to the 14th I was chiefly employed in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced.&#160; The application which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps which had never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend it to any to practise, by this experiment: and though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time.&#160; I learned from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could be, especially in those rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came in the dry season was almost always accompanied with such storms, so I found that rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September and October.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00007">CHAPTER VII&#8212;AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months.&#160; All possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I firmly believe that no human shape had ever set foot upon that place.&#160; Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to see what other productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.</p>
<p>It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey of the island itself.&#160; I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore.&#160; I found after I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a little brook of running water, very fresh and good; but this being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it&#8212;at least not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived.&#160; On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk.&#160; There were divers other plants, which I had no notion of or understanding about, that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out.&#160; I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could find none.&#160; I saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand them.&#160; I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect.&#160; I contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover, but could bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field; at least, very little that might serve to any purpose now in my distress.</p>
<p>The next day, the sixteenth, I went up the same way again; and after going something further than I had gone the day before, I found the brook and the savannahs cease, and the country become more woody than before.&#160; In this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees.&#160; The vines had spread, indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich.&#160; This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers.&#160; But I found an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and agreeable to eat when no grapes could be had.</p>
<p>I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation; which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from home.&#160; In the night, I took my first contrivance, and got up in a tree, where I slept well; and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery; travelling nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me.&#160; At the end of this march I came to an opening where the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of spring that it looked like a planted garden.&#160; I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to think that this was all my own; that I was king and lord of all this country indefensibly, and had a right of possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in England.&#160; I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and citron trees; but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then.&#160; However, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.&#160; I found now I had business enough to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching.&#160; In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled homewards; resolving to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home.&#160; Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent and my cave); but before I got thither the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having broken them and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing; as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.</p>
<p>The next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having made me two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, to find them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten and devoured.&#160; By this I concluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were I knew not.&#160; However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under.</p>
<p>When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation; the security from storms on that side of the water, and the wood: and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by far the worst part of the country.&#160; Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as where now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of the island.</p>
<p>This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the seaside, where it was at least possible that something might happen to my advantage, and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove.&#160; However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time there for the whole of the remaining part of the month of July; and though upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights together; always going over it with a ladder; so that I fancied now I had my country house and my sea-coast house; and this work took me up to the beginning of August.</p>
<p>I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.</p>
<p>About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself.&#160; The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung up perfectly dried, and, indeed, were excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them.&#160; No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried the most of them home to my cave, than it began to rain; and from hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day till the middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several days.</p>
<p>In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my family; I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tidings of her till, to my astonishment, she came home about the end of August with three kittens.&#160; This was the more strange to me because, though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a different kind from our European cats; but the young cats were the same kind of house-breed as the old one; and both my cats being females, I thought it very strange.&#160; But from these three cats I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats that I was forced to kill them like vermin or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as possible.</p>
<p>From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet.&#160; In this confinement, I began to be straitened for food: but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat&#8217;s flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled&#8212;for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything; and two or three of the turtle&#8217;s eggs for my supper.</p>
<p>During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out this way.&#160; But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now I thought I lay exposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.</p>
<p><i>Sept.</i> 30.&#8212;I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing.&#160; I cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days.&#160; I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging His righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ; and not having tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I began it.&#160; I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the Sabbath day, and so did not really know what any of the days were; but now, having cast up the days as above, I found I had been there a year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account I had lost a day or two in my reckoning.&#160; A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memorandum of other things.</p>
<p>The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but I bought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going to relate was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made.</p>
<p>I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it, after the rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from me.&#160; Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.&#160; It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to anything: for the dry months following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.&#160; Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal equinox; and this having the rainy months of March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of each kind.&#160; But by this experiment I was made master of my business, and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times and two harvests every year.</p>
<p>While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was of use to me afterwards.&#160; As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began to settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the country to my bower, where, though I had not been some months, yet I found all things just as I left them.&#160; The circle or double hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head.&#160; I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from.&#160; I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much alike as I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three years; so that though the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.&#160; This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semi-circle round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.</p>
<p>I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally thus:&#8212;The half of February, the whole of March, and the half of April&#8212;rainy, the sun being then on or near the equinox.</p>
<p>The half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the half of August&#8212;dry, the sun being then to the north of the line.</p>
<p>The half of August, the whole of September, and the half of October&#8212;rainy, the sun being then come back.</p>
<p>The half of October, the whole of November, December, and January, and the half of February&#8212;dry, the sun being then to the south of the line.</p>
<p>The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds happened to blow, but this was the general observation I made.&#160; After I had found by experience the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as possible during the wet months.&#160; This time I found much employment, and very suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion for many things which I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant application; particularly I tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing.&#160; It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker&#8217;s, in the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner in which they worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but the materials, when it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows, and osiers in England, and I resolved to try.&#160; Accordingly, the next day I went to my country house, as I called it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them.&#160; These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they were fit for use I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets, both to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had occasion; and though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose; thus, afterwards, I took care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more, especially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.</p>
<p>Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants.&#160; I had no vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and some glass bottles&#8212;some of the common size, and others which were case bottles, square, for the holding of water, spirits, &amp;c.&#160; I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big for such as I desired it&#8212;viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself.&#160; The second thing I fain would have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible to me to make one; however, I found a contrivance for that, too, at last.&#160; I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or piles, and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry season, when another business took me up more time than it could be imagined I could spare.</p>
