<p>He had no sooner entered than the voice of his friend Gillingham greeted him from the front room.</p>
<p>"I could make nobody hear; so finding your door open I walked in, and made myself comfortable. I said I would call, you remember."</p>
<p>"Yes. I am much obliged to you, Gillingham, particularly for coming to-night."</p>
<p>"How is Mrs.&#8212;"</p>
<p>"She is quite well. She is gone&#8212;just gone. That's her tea-cup, that she drank out of only an hour ago. And that's the plate she&#8212;" Phillotson's throat got choked up, and he could not go on. He turned and pushed the tea-things aside.</p>
<p>"Have you had any tea, by the by?" he asked presently in a renewed voice.</p>
<p>"No&#8212;yes&#8212;never mind," said Gillingham, preoccupied. "Gone, you say she is?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#8230; I would have died for her; but I wouldn't be cruel to her in the name of the law. She is, as I understand, gone to join her lover. What they are going to do I cannot say. Whatever it may be she has my full consent to."</p>
<p>There was a stability, a ballast, in Phillotson's pronouncement which restrained his friend's comment. "Shall I&#8212;leave you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No, no. It is a mercy to me that you have come. I have some articles to arrange and clear away. Would you help me?"</p>
<p>Gillingham assented; and having gone to the upper rooms the schoolmaster opened drawers, and began taking out all Sue's things that she had left behind, and laying them in a large box. "She wouldn't take all I wanted her to," he continued. "But when I made up my mind to her going to live in her own way I did make up my mind."</p>
<p>"Some men would have stopped at an agreement to separate."</p>
<p>"I've gone into all that, and don't wish to argue it. I was, and am, the most old-fashioned man in the world on the question of marriage&#8212;in fact I had never thought critically about its ethics at all. But certain facts stared me in the face, and I couldn't go against them."</p>
<p>They went on with the packing silently. When it was done Phillotson closed the box and turned the key.</p>
<p>"There," he said. "To adorn her in somebody's eyes; never again in mine!"</p>

<p>Four-and-twenty hours before this time Sue had written the following note to Jude:<br/>
&#160;</p>
<blockquote><div>
<blockquote><div>
<p>It is as I told you; and I am leaving to-morrow evening. Richard and I thought it could be done with less obtrusiveness after dark. I feel rather frightened, and therefore ask you to be sure you are on the Melchester platform to meet me. I arrive at a little to seven. I know you will, of course, dear Jude; but I feel so timid that I can't help begging you to be punctual. He has been so <i>very</i> kind to me through it all!</p>
<p>Now to our meeting!</p>
<p><span class="ind15">S.</span><br/>
&#160;</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from the mountain town&#8212;the single passenger that evening&#8212;she regarded the receding road with a sad face. But no hesitation was apparent therein.</p>
<p>The up-train by which she was departing stopped by signal only. To Sue it seemed strange that such a powerful organization as a railway train should be brought to a stand-still on purpose for her&#8212;a fugitive from her lawful home.</p>
<p>The twenty minutes' journey drew towards its close, and Sue began gathering her things together to alight. At the moment that the train came to a stand-still by the Melchester platform a hand was laid on the door and she beheld Jude. He entered the compartment promptly. He had a black bag in his hand, and was dressed in the dark suit he wore on Sundays and in the evening after work. Altogether he looked a very handsome young fellow, his ardent affection for her burning in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh Jude!" She clasped his hand with both hers, and her tense state caused her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs. "I&#8212;I am so glad! I get out here?"</p>
<p>"No. I get in, dear one! I've packed. Besides this bag I've only a big box which is labelled."</p>
<p>"But don't I get out? Aren't we going to stay here?"</p>
<p>"We couldn't possibly, don't you see. We are known here&#8212;I, at any rate, am well known. I've booked for Aldbrickham; and here's your ticket for the same place, as you have only one to here."</p>
<p>"I thought we should have stayed here," she repeated.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't have done at all."</p>
<p>"Ah! Perhaps not."</p>
<p>"There wasn't time for me to write and say the place I had decided on. Aldbrickham is a much bigger town&#8212;sixty or seventy thousand inhabitants&#8212;and nobody knows anything about us there."</p>
<p>"And you have given up your cathedral work here?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It was rather sudden&#8212;your message coming unexpectedly. Strictly, I might have been made to finish out the week. But I pleaded urgency and I was let off. I would have deserted any day at your command, dear Sue. I have deserted more than that for you!"</p>
<p>"I fear I am doing you a lot of harm. Ruining your prospects of the Church; ruining your progress in your trade; everything!"</p>
<p>"The Church is no more to me. Let it lie! <i>I</i> am not to be one of<br/>
&#160;</p>
<blockquote><div>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="ind2">The soldier-saints who, row on row,</span><br/>
Burn upward each to his point of bliss,<br/>
&#160;</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">if any such there be! My point of bliss is not upward, but here."</p>
<p>"Oh I seem so bad&#8212;upsetting men's courses like this!" said she, taking up in her voice the emotion that had begun in his. But she recovered her equanimity by the time they had travelled a dozen miles.</p>
<p>"He has been so good in letting me go," she resumed. "And here's a note I found on my dressing-table, addressed to you."</p>
<p>"Yes. He's not an unworthy fellow," said Jude, glancing at the note. "And I am ashamed of myself for hating him because he married you."</p>
<p>"According to the rule of women's whims I suppose I ought to suddenly love him, because he has let me go so generously and unexpectedly," she answered smiling. "But I am so cold, or devoid of gratitude, or so something, that even this generosity hasn't made me love him, or repent, or want to stay with him as his wife; although I do feel I like his large-mindedness, and respect him more than ever."</p>
<p>"It may not work so well for us as if he had been less kind, and you had run away against his will," murmured Jude.</p>
<p>"That I <i>never</i> would have done."</p>
<p>Jude's eyes rested musingly on her face. Then he suddenly kissed her; and was going to kiss her again. "No&#8212;only once now&#8212;please, Jude!"</p>
<p>"That's rather cruel," he answered; but acquiesced. "Such a strange thing has happened to me," Jude continued after a silence. "Arabella has actually written to ask me to get a divorce from her&#8212;in kindness to her, she says. She wants to honestly and legally marry that man she has already married virtually; and begs me to enable her to do it."</p>
<p>"What have you done?"</p>
<p>"I have agreed. I thought at first I couldn't do it without getting her into trouble about that second marriage, and I don't want to injure her in any way. Perhaps she's no worse than I am, after all! But nobody knows about it over here, and I find it will not be a difficult proceeding at all. If she wants to start afresh I have only too obvious reasons for not hindering her."</p>
<p>"Then you'll be free?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I shall be free."</p>
<p>"Where are we booked for?" she asked, with the discontinuity that marked her to-night.</p>
<p>"Aldbrickham, as I said."</p>
<p>"But it will be very late when we get there?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I thought of that, and I wired for a room for us at the Temperance Hotel there."</p>
<p>"One?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#8212;one."</p>
<p>She looked at him. "Oh Jude!" Sue bent her forehead against the corner of the compartment. "I thought you might do it; and that I was deceiving you. But I didn't mean that!"</p>
<p>In the pause which followed, Jude's eyes fixed themselves with a stultified expression on the opposite seat. "Well!" he said&#8230; "Well!"</p>
<p>He remained in silence; and seeing how discomfited he was she put her face against his cheek, murmuring, "Don't be vexed, dear!"</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;there's no harm done," he said. "But&#8212;I understood it like that&#8230; Is this a sudden change of mind?"</p>
<p>"You have no right to ask me such a question; and I shan't answer!" she said, smiling.</p>
<p>"My dear one, your happiness is more to me than anything&#8212;although we seem to verge on quarrelling so often!&#8212;and your will is law to me. I am something more than a mere&#8212;selfish fellow, I hope. Have it as you wish!" On reflection his brow showed perplexity. "But perhaps it is that you don't love me&#8212;not that you have become conventional! Much as, under your teaching, I hate convention, I hope it <i>is</i> that, not the other terrible alternative!"</p>
<p>Even at this obvious moment for candour Sue could not be quite candid as to the state of that mystery, her heart. "Put it down to my timidity," she said with hurried evasiveness; "to a woman's natural timidity when the crisis comes. I may feel as well as you that I have a perfect right to live with you as you thought&#8212;from this moment. I may hold the opinion that, in a proper state of society, the father of a woman's child will be as much a private matter of hers as the cut of her underlinen, on whom nobody will have any right to question her. But partly, perhaps, because it is by his generosity that I am now free, I would rather not be other than a little rigid. If there had been a rope-ladder, and he had run after us with pistols, it would have seemed different, and I may have acted otherwise. But don't press me and criticize me, Jude! Assume that I haven't the courage of my opinions. I know I am a poor miserable creature. My nature is not so passionate as yours!"</p>
<p>He repeated simply! "I thought&#8212;what I naturally thought. But if we are not lovers, we are not. Phillotson thought so, I am sure. See, here is what he has written to me." He opened the letter she had brought, and read:</p>
<p>"I make only one condition&#8212;that you are tender and kind to her. I know you love her. But even love may be cruel at times. You are made for each other: it is obvious, palpable, to any unbiased older person. You were all along 'the shadowy third' in my short life with her. I repeat, take care of Sue."</p>
<p>"He's a good fellow, isn't he!" she said with latent tears. On reconsideration she added, "He was very resigned to letting me go&#8212;too resigned almost! I never was so near being in love with him as when he made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable on my journey, and offering to provide money. Yet I was not. If I loved him ever so little as a wife, I'd go back to him even now."</p>
<p>"But you don't, do you?"</p>
<p>"It is true&#8212;oh so terribly true!&#8212;I don't."</p>
<p>"Nor me neither, I half-fear!" he said pettishly. "Nor anybody perhaps! Sue, sometimes, when I am vexed with you, I think you are incapable of real love."</p>
<p>"That's not good and loyal of you!" she said, and drawing away from him as far as she could, looked severely out into the darkness. She added in hurt tones, without turning round: "My liking for you is not as some women's perhaps. But it is a delight in being with you, of a supremely delicate kind, and I don't want to go further and risk it by&#8212;an attempt to intensify it! I quite realized that, as woman with man, it was a risk to come. But, as me with you, I resolved to trust you to set my wishes above your gratification. Don't discuss it further, dear Jude!"</p>
<p>"Of course, if it would make you reproach yourself&#8230; but you do like me very much, Sue? Say you do! Say that you do a quarter, a tenth, as much as I do you, and I'll be content!"</p>
<p>"I've let you kiss me, and that tells enough."</p>
<p>"Just once or so!"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;don't be a greedy boy."</p>
<p>He leant back, and did not look at her for a long time. That episode in her past history of which she had told him&#8212;of the poor Christminster graduate whom she had handled thus, returned to Jude's mind; and he saw himself as a possible second in such a torturing destiny.</p>
<p>"This is a queer elopement!" he murmured. "Perhaps you are making a cat's paw of me with Phillotson all this time. Upon my word it almost seems so&#8212;to see you sitting up there so prim!"</p>
<p>"Now you mustn't be angry&#8212;I won't let you!" she coaxed, turning and moving nearer to him. "You did kiss me just now, you know; and I didn't dislike you to, I own it, Jude. Only I don't want to let you do it again, just yet&#8212;considering how we are circumstanced, don't you see!"</p>
<p>He could never resist her when she pleaded (as she well knew). And they sat side by side with joined hands, till she aroused herself at some thought.</p>
<p>"I can't possibly go to that Temperance Inn, after your telegraphing that message!"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"You can see well enough!"</p>
<p>"Very well; there'll be some other one open, no doubt. I have sometimes thought, since your marrying Phillotson because of a stupid scandal, that under the affectation of independent views you are as enslaved to the social code as any woman I know!"</p>
<p>"Not mentally. But I haven't the courage of my views, as I said before. I didn't marry him altogether because of the scandal. But sometimes a woman's <i>love of being loved</i> gets the better of her conscience, and though she is agonized at the thought of treating a man cruelly, she encourages him to love her while she doesn't love him at all. Then, when she sees him suffering, her remorse sets in, and she does what she can to repair the wrong."</p>
<p>"You simply mean that you flirted outrageously with him, poor old chap, and then repented, and to make reparation, married him, though you tortured yourself to death by doing it."</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;if you will put it brutally!&#8212;it was a little like that&#8212;that and the scandal together&#8212;and your concealing from me what you ought to have told me before!"</p>
<p>He could see that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms, and soothed her, saying: "There, dear; don't mind! Crucify me, if you will! You know you are all the world to me, whatever you do!"</p>
<p>"I am very bad and unprincipled&#8212;I know you think that!" she said, trying to blink away her tears.</p>
<p>"I think and know you are my dear Sue, from whom neither length nor breadth, nor things present nor things to come, can divide me!"</p>
<p>Though so sophisticated in many things she was such a child in others that this satisfied her, and they reached the end of their journey on the best of terms. It was about ten o'clock when they arrived at Aldbrickham, the county town of North Wessex. As she would not go to the Temperance Hotel because of the form of his telegram, Jude inquired for another; and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled their luggage to the George farther on, which proved to be the inn at which Jude had stayed with Arabella on that one occasion of their meeting after their division for years.</p>
<p>Owing, however, to their now entering it by another door, and to his preoccupation, he did not at first recognize the place. When they had engaged their respective rooms they went down to a late supper. During Jude's temporary absence the waiting-maid spoke to Sue.</p>
<p>"I think, ma'am, I remember your relation, or friend, or whatever he is, coming here once before&#8212;late, just like this, with his wife&#8212;a lady, at any rate, that wasn't you by no manner of means&#8212;jest as med be with you now."</p>
<p>"Oh do you?" said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart. "Though I think you must be mistaken! How long ago was it?"</p>
<p>"About a month or two. A handsome, full-figured woman. They had this room."</p>
<p>When Jude came back and sat down to supper Sue seemed moping and miserable. "Jude," she said to him plaintively, at their parting that night upon the landing, "it is not so nice and pleasant as it used to be with us! I don't like it here&#8212;I can't bear the place! And I don't like you so well as I did!"</p>
<p>"How fidgeted you seem, dear! Why do you change like this?"</p>
<p>"Because it was cruel to bring me here!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You were lately here with Arabella. There, now I have said it!"</p>
<p>"Dear me, why&#8212;" said Jude looking round him. "Yes&#8212;it is the same! I really didn't know it, Sue. Well&#8212;it is not cruel, since we have come as we have&#8212;two relations staying together."</p>
<p>"How long ago was it you were here? Tell me, tell me!"</p>
<p>"The day before I met you in Christminster, when we went back to Marygreen together. I told you I had met her."</p>
<p>"Yes, you said you had met her, but you didn't tell me all. Your story was that you had met as estranged people, who were not husband and wife at all in Heaven's sight&#8212;not that you had made it up with her."</p>
<p>"We didn't make it up," he said sadly. "I can't explain, Sue."</p>
<p>"You've been false to me; you, my last hope! And I shall never forget it, never!"</p>
<p>"But by your own wish, dear Sue, we are only to be friends, not lovers! It is so very inconsistent of you to&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Friends can be jealous!"</p>
<p>"I don't see that. You concede nothing to me and I have to concede everything to you. After all, you were on good terms with your husband at that time."</p>
<p>"No, I wasn't, Jude. Oh how can you think so! And you have taken me in, even if you didn't intend to." She was so mortified that he was obliged to take her into her room and close the door lest the people should hear. "Was it this room? Yes it was&#8212;I see by your look it was! I won't have it for mine! Oh it was treacherous of you to have her again! <i>I</i> jumped out of the window!"</p>
<p>"But Sue, she was, after all, my legal wife, if not&#8212;"</p>
<p>Slipping down on her knees Sue buried her face in the bed and wept.</p>
<p>"I never knew such an unreasonable&#8212;such a dog-in-the-manger feeling," said Jude. "I am not to approach you, nor anybody else!"</p>
<p>"Oh don't you <i>understand</i> my feeling! Why don't you! Why are you so gross! <i>I</i> jumped out of the window!"</p>
<p>"Jumped out of window?"</p>
<p>"I can't explain!"</p>
<p>It was true that he did not understand her feelings very well. But he did a little; and began to love her none the less.</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I thought you cared for nobody&#8212;desired nobody in the world but me at that time&#8212;and ever since!" continued Sue.</p>
<p>"It is true. I did not, and don't now!" said Jude, as distressed as she.</p>
<p>"But you must have thought much of her! Or&#8212;"</p>
<p>"No&#8212;I need not&#8212;you don't understand me either&#8212;women never do! Why should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?"</p>
<p>Looking up from the quilt she pouted provokingly: "If it hadn't been for that, perhaps I would have gone on to the Temperance Hotel, after all, as you proposed; for I was beginning to think I did belong to you!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it is of no consequence!" said Jude distantly.</p>
<p>"I thought, of course, that she had never been really your wife since she left you of her own accord years and years ago! My sense of it was, that a parting such as yours from her, and mine from him, ended the marriage."</p>
<p>"I can't say more without speaking against her, and I don't want to do that," said he. "Yet I must tell you one thing, which would settle the matter in any case. She has married another man&#8212;really married him! I knew nothing about it till after the visit we made here."</p>
<p>"Married another? &#8230; It is a crime&#8212;as the world treats it, but does not believe."</p>
<p>"There&#8212;now you are yourself again. Yes, it is a crime&#8212;as you don't hold, but would fearfully concede. But I shall never inform against her! And it is evidently a prick of conscience in her that has led her to urge me to get a divorce, that she may remarry this man legally. So you perceive I shall not be likely to see her again."</p>
<p>"And you didn't really know anything of this when you saw her?" said Sue more gently, as she rose.</p>
<p>"I did not. Considering all things, I don't think you ought to be angry, darling!"</p>
<p>"I am not. But I shan't go to the Temperance Hotel!"</p>
<p>He laughed. "Never mind!" he said. "So that I am near you, I am comparatively happy. It is more than this earthly wretch called Me deserves&#8212;you spirit, you disembodied creature, you dear, sweet, tantalizing phantom&#8212;hardly flesh at all; so that when I put my arms round you I almost expect them to pass through you as through air! Forgive me for being gross, as you call it! Remember that our calling cousins when really strangers was a snare. The enmity of our parents gave a piquancy to you in my eyes that was intenser even than the novelty of ordinary new acquaintance."</p>
<p>"Say those pretty lines, then, from Shelley's 'Epipsychidion' as if they meant me!" she solicited, slanting up closer to him as they stood. "Don't you know them?"</p>
<p>"I know hardly any poetry," he replied mournfully.</p>
<p>"Don't you? These are some of them:<br/>

<p>Oh it is too flattering, so I won't go on! But say it's me! Say it's me!"</p>
<p>"It is you, dear; exactly like you!"</p>
<p>"Now I forgive you! And you shall kiss me just once there&#8212;not very long." She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek; and he did as commanded. "You do care for me very much, don't you, in spite of my not&#8212;you know?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sweet!" he said with a sigh; and bade her good-night.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00045">VI</h2>
<p>In returning to his native town of Shaston as schoolmaster Phillotson had won the interest and awakened the memories of the inhabitants, who, though they did not honour him for his miscellaneous aquirements as he would have been honoured elsewhere, retained for him a sincere regard. When, shortly after his arrival, he brought home a pretty wife&#8212;awkwardly pretty for him, if he did not take care, they said&#8212;they were glad to have her settle among them.</p>
<p>For some time after her flight from that home Sue's absence did not excite comment. Her place as monitor in the school was taken by another young woman within a few days of her vacating it, which substitution also passed without remark, Sue's services having been of a provisional nature only. When, however, a month had passed, and Phillotson casually admitted to an acquaintance that he did not know where his wife was staying, curiosity began to be aroused; till, jumping to conclusions, people ventured to affirm that Sue had played him false and run away from him. The schoolmaster's growing languor and listlessness over his work gave countenance to the idea.</p>
<p>Though Phillotson had held his tongue as long as he could, except to his friend Gillingham, his honesty and directness would not allow him to do so when misapprehensions as to Sue's conduct spread abroad. On a Monday morning the chairman of the school committee called, and after attending to the business of the school drew Phillotson aside out of earshot of the children.</p>
<p>"You'll excuse my asking, Phillotson, since everybody is talking of it: is this true as to your domestic affairs&#8212;that your wife's going away was on no visit, but a secret elopement with a lover? If so, I condole with you."</p>
<p>"Don't," said Phillotson. "There was no secret about it."</p>
<p>"She has gone to visit friends?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then what has happened?"</p>
<p>"She has gone away under circumstances that usually call for condolence with the husband. But I gave my consent."</p>
<p>The chairman looked as if he had not apprehended the remark.</p>
<p>"What I say is quite true," Phillotson continued testily. "She asked leave to go away with her lover, and I let her. Why shouldn't I? A woman of full age, it was a question of her own conscience&#8212;not for me. I was not her gaoler. I can't explain any further. I don't wish to be questioned."</p>
<p>The children observed that much seriousness marked the faces of the two men, and went home and told their parents that something new had happened about Mrs. Phillotson. Then Phillotson's little maidservant, who was a schoolgirl just out of her standards, said that Mr. Phillotson had helped in his wife's packing, had offered her what money she required, and had written a friendly letter to her young man, telling him to take care of her. The chairman of committee thought the matter over, and talked to the other managers of the school, till a request came to Phillotson to meet them privately. The meeting lasted a long time, and at the end the school-master came home, looking as usual pale and worn. Gillingham was sitting in his house awaiting him.</p>
<p>"Well; it is as you said," observed Phillotson, flinging himself down wearily in a chair. "They have requested me to send in my resignation on account of my scandalous conduct in giving my tortured wife her liberty&#8212;or, as they call it, condoning her adultery. But I shan't resign!"</p>
<p>"I think I would."</p>
<p>"I won't. It is no business of theirs. It doesn't affect me in my public capacity at all. They may expel me if they like."</p>
<p>"If you make a fuss it will get into the papers, and you'll never get appointed to another school. You see, they have to consider what you did as done by a teacher of youth&#8212;and its effects as such upon the morals of the town; and, to ordinary opinion, your position is indefensible. You must let me say that."</p>
<p>To this good advice, however, Phillotson would not listen.</p>
<p>"I don't care," he said. "I don't go unless I am turned out. And for this reason; that by resigning I acknowledge I have acted wrongly by her; when I am more and more convinced every day that in the sight of Heaven and by all natural, straightforward humanity, I have acted rightly."</p>
<p>Gillingham saw that his rather headstrong friend would not be able to maintain such a position as this; but he said nothing further, and in due time&#8212;indeed, in a quarter of an hour&#8212;the formal letter of dismissal arrived, the managers having remained behind to write it after Phillotson's withdrawal. The latter replied that he should not accept dismissal; and called a public meeting, which he attended, although he looked so weak and ill that his friend implored him to stay at home. When he stood up to give his reasons for contesting the decision of the managers he advanced them firmly, as he had done to his friend, and contended, moreover, that the matter was a domestic theory which did not concern them. This they over-ruled, insisting that the private eccentricities of a teacher came quite within their sphere of control, as it touched the morals of those he taught. Phillotson replied that he did not see how an act of natural charity could injure morals.</p>
<p>All the respectable inhabitants and well-to-do fellow-natives of the town were against Phillotson to a man. But, somewhat to his surprise, some dozen or more champions rose up in his defence as from the ground.</p>
<p>It has been stated that Shaston was the anchorage of a curious and interesting group of itinerants, who frequented the numerous fairs and markets held up and down Wessex during the summer and autumn months. Although Phillotson had never spoken to one of these gentlemen they now nobly led the forlorn hope in his defence. The body included two cheap Jacks, a shooting-gallery proprietor and the ladies who loaded the guns, a pair of boxing-masters, a steam-roundabout manager, two travelling broom-makers, who called themselves widows, a gingerbread-stall keeper, a swing-boat owner, and a "test-your-strength" man.</p>
<p>This generous phalanx of supporters, and a few others of independent judgment, whose own domestic experiences had been not without vicissitude, came up and warmly shook hands with Phillotson; after which they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting that issue was joined, the result being a general scuffle, wherein a black board was split, three panes of the school windows were broken, an inkbottle was spilled over a town-councillor's shirt front, a churchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of Palestine that his head went right through Samaria, and many black eyes and bleeding noses were given, one of which, to everybody's horror, was the venerable incumbent's, owing to the zeal of an emancipated chimney-sweep, who took the side of Phillotson's party. When Phillotson saw the blood running down the rector's face he deplored almost in groans the untoward and degrading circumstances, regretted that he had not resigned when called upon, and went home so ill that next morning he could not leave his bed.</p>
<p>The farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious illness for him; and he lay in his lonely bed in the pathetic state of mind of a middle-aged man who perceives at length that his life, intellectual and domestic, is tending to failure and gloom. Gillingham came to see him in the evenings, and on one occasion mentioned Sue's name.</p>
<p>"She doesn't care anything about me!" said Phillotson. "Why should she?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't know you are ill."</p>
<p>"So much the better for both of us."</p>
<p>"Where are her lover and she living?"</p>
<p>"At Melchester&#8212;I suppose; at least he was living there some time ago."</p>
<p>When Gillingham reached home he sat and reflected, and at last wrote an anonymous line to Sue, on the bare chance of its reaching her, the letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the diocesan capital. Arriving at that place it was forwarded to Marygreen in North Wessex, and thence to Aldbrickham by the only person who knew his present address&#8212;the widow who had nursed his aunt.</p>
<p>Three days later, in the evening, when the sun was going down in splendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor, and making the Shaston windows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale, the sick man fancied that he heard somebody come to the house, and a few minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door. Phillotson did not speak; the door was hesitatingly opened, and there entered&#8212;Sue.</p>
<p>She was in light spring clothing, and her advent seemed ghostly&#8212;like the flitting in of a moth. He turned his eyes upon her, and flushed; but appeared to check his primary impulse to speak.</p>
<p>"I have no business here," she said, bending her frightened face to him. "But I heard you were ill&#8212;very ill; and&#8212;and as I know that you recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical love, I have come."</p>
<p>"I am not very ill, my dear friend. Only unwell."</p>
<p>"I didn't know that; and I am afraid that only a severe illness would have justified my coming!"</p>
<p>"Yes&#8230; yes. And I almost wish you had not come! It is a little too soon&#8212;that's all I mean. Still, let us make the best of it. You haven't heard about the school, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"No&#8212;what about it?"</p>
<p>"Only that I am going away from here to another place. The managers and I don't agree, and we are going to part&#8212;that's all."</p>
<p>Sue did not for a moment, either now or later, suspect what troubles had resulted to him from letting her go; it never once seemed to cross her mind, and she had received no news whatever from Shaston. They talked on slight and ephemeral subjects, and when his tea was brought up he told the amazed little servant that a cup was to be set for Sue. That young person was much more interested in their history than they supposed, and as she descended the stairs she lifted her eyes and hands in grotesque amazement. While they sipped Sue went to the window and thoughtfully said, "It is such a beautiful sunset, Richard."</p>
<p>"They are mostly beautiful from here, owing to the rays crossing the mist of the vale. But I lose them all, as they don't shine into this gloomy corner where I lie."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like to see this particular one? It is like heaven opened."</p>
<p>"Ah yes! But I can't."</p>
<p>"I'll help you to."</p>
<p>"No&#8212;the bedstead can't be shifted."</p>
<p>"But see how I mean."</p>
<p>She went to where a swing-glass stood, and taking it in her hands carried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine, moving the glass till the beams were reflected into Phillotson's face.</p>
<p>"There&#8212;you can see the great red sun now!" she said. "And I am sure it will cheer you&#8212;I do so hope it will!" She spoke with a childlike, repentant kindness, as if she could not do too much for him.</p>
<p>Phillotson smiled sadly. "You are an odd creature!" he murmured as the sun glowed in his eyes. "The idea of your coming to see me after what has passed!"</p>
<p>"Don't let us go back upon that!" she said quickly. "I have to catch the omnibus for the train, as Jude doesn't know I have come; he was out when I started; so I must return home almost directly. Richard, I am so very glad you are better. You don't hate me, do you? You have been such a kind friend to me!"</p>
<p>"I am glad to know you think so," said Phillotson huskily. "No. I don't hate you!"</p>
<p>It grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent chat, and when candles were brought and it was time to leave she put her hand in his or rather allowed it to flit through his; for she was significantly light in touch. She had nearly closed the door when he said, "Sue!" He had noticed that, in turning away from him, tears were on her face and a quiver in her lip.</p>
<p>It was bad policy to recall her&#8212;he knew it while he pursued it. But he could not help it. She came back.</p>
<p>"Sue," he murmured, "do you wish to make it up, and stay? I'll forgive you and condone everything!"</p>
<p>"Oh you can't, you can't!" she said hastily. "You can't condone it now!"</p>
<p>"<i>He</i> is your husband now, in effect, you mean, of course?"</p>
<p>"You may assume it. He is obtaining a divorce from his wife Arabella."</p>
<p>"His wife! It is altogether news to me that he has a wife."</p>
<p>"It was a bad marriage."</p>
<p>"Like yours."</p>
<p>"Like mine. He is not doing it so much on his own account as on hers. She wrote and told him it would be a kindness to her, since then she could marry and live respectably. And Jude has agreed."</p>
<p>"A wife&#8230; A kindness to her. Ah, yes; a kindness to her to release her altogether&#8230; But I don't like the sound of it. I can forgive, Sue."</p>
<p>"No, no! You can't have me back now I have been so wicked&#8212;as to do what I have done!"</p>
<p>There had arisen in Sue's face that incipient fright which showed itself whenever he changed from friend to husband, and which made her adopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him. "I <i>must</i> go now. I'll come again&#8212;may I?"</p>
<p>"I don't ask you to go, even now. I ask you to stay."</p>
<p>"I thank you, Richard; but I must. As you are not so ill as I thought, I <i>cannot</i> stay!"</p>
<p>"She's his&#8212;his from lips to heel!" said Phillotson; but so faintly that in closing the door she did not hear it. The dread of a reactionary change in the schoolmaster's sentiments, coupled, perhaps, with a faint shamefacedness at letting even him know what a slipshod lack of thoroughness, from a man's point of view, characterized her transferred allegiance, prevented her telling him of her, thus far, incomplete relations with Jude; and Phillotson lay writhing like a man in hell as he pictured the prettily dressed, maddening compound of sympathy and averseness who bore his name, returning impatiently to the home of her lover.</p>
<p>Gillingham was so interested in Phillotson's affairs, and so seriously concerned about him, that he walked up the hill-side to Shaston two or three times a week, although, there and back, it was a journey of nine miles, which had to be performed between tea and supper, after a hard day's work in school. When he called on the next occasion after Sue's visit his friend was downstairs, and Gillingham noticed that his restless mood had been supplanted by a more fixed and composed one.</p>
<p>"She's been here since you called last," said Phillotson.</p>
<p>"Not Mrs. Phillotson?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Ah! You have made it up?"</p>
<p>"No&#8230; She just came, patted my pillow with her little white hand, played the thoughtful nurse for half an hour, and went away."</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;I'm hanged! A little hussy!"</p>
<p>"What do you say?"</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;nothing!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean, what a tantalizing, capricious little woman! If she were not your wife&#8212;"</p>
<p>"She is not; she's another man's except in name and law. And I have been thinking&#8212;it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with her&#8212;that, in kindness to her, I ought to dissolve the legal tie altogether; which, singularly enough, I think I can do, now she has been back, and refused my request to stay after I said I had forgiven her. I believe that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it, though I did not see it at the moment. What's the use of keeping her chained on to me if she doesn't belong to me? I know&#8212;I feel absolutely certain&#8212;that she would welcome my taking such a step as the greatest charity to her. For though as a fellow-creature she sympathizes with, and pities me, and even weeps for me, as a husband she cannot endure me&#8212;she loathes me&#8212;there's no use in mincing words&#8212;she loathes me, and my only manly, and dignified, and merciful course is to complete what I have begun&#8230; And for worldly reasons, too, it will be better for her to be independent. I have hopelessly ruined my prospects because of my decision as to what was best for us, though she does not know it; I see only dire poverty ahead from my feet to the grave; for I can be accepted as teacher no more. I shall probably have enough to do to make both ends meet during the remainder of my life, now my occupation's gone; and I shall be better able to bear it alone. I may as well tell you that what has suggested my letting her go is some news she brought me&#8212;the news that Fawley is doing the same."</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;he had a spouse, too? A queer couple, these lovers!"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;I don't want your opinion on that. What I was going to say is that my liberating her can do her no possible harm, and will open up a chance of happiness for her which she has never dreamt of hitherto. For then they'll be able to marry, as they ought to have done at first."</p>
<p>Gillingham did not hurry to reply. "I may disagree with your motive," he said gently, for he respected views he could not share. "But I think you are right in your determination&#8212;if you can carry it out. I doubt, however, if you can."</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00048">I</h2>
<p>How Gillingham's doubts were disposed of will most quickly appear by passing over the series of dreary months and incidents that followed the events of the last chapter, and coming on to a Sunday in the February of the year following.</p>
<p>Sue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham, in precisely the same relations that they had established between themselves when she left Shaston to join him the year before. The proceedings in the law-courts had reached their consciousness, but as a distant sound and an occasional missive which they hardly understood.</p>
<p>They had met, as usual, to breakfast together in the little house with Jude's name on it, that he had taken at fifteen pounds a year, with three-pounds-ten extra for rates and taxes, and furnished with his aunt's ancient and lumbering goods, which had cost him about their full value to bring all the way from Marygreen. Sue kept house, and managed everything.</p>
<p>As he entered the room this morning Sue held up a letter she had just received.</p>
<p>"Well; and what is it about?" he said after kissing her.</p>
<p>"That the decree <i>nisi</i> in the case of Phillotson <i>versus</i> Phillotson and Fawley, pronounced six months ago, has just been made absolute."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Jude, as he sat down.</p>
<p>The same concluding incident in Jude's suit against Arabella had occurred about a month or two earlier. Both cases had been too insignificant to be reported in the papers, further than by name in a long list of other undefended cases.</p>
<p>"Now then, Sue, at any rate, you can do what you like!" He looked at his sweetheart curiously.</p>
<p>"Are we&#8212;you and I&#8212;just as free now as if we had never married at all?"</p>
<p>"Just as free&#8212;except, I believe, that a clergyman may object personally to remarry you, and hand the job on to somebody else."</p>
<p>"But I wonder&#8212;do you think it is really so with us? I know it is generally. But I have an uncomfortable feeling that my freedom has been obtained under false pretences!"</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;if the truth about us had been known, the decree wouldn't have been pronounced. It is only, is it, because we have made no defence, and have led them into a false supposition? Therefore is my freedom lawful, however proper it may be?"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;why did you let it be under false pretences? You have only yourself to blame," he said mischievously.</p>
<p>"Jude&#8212;don't! You ought not to be touchy about that still. You must take me as I am."</p>
<p>"Very well, darling: so I will. Perhaps you were right. As to your question, we were not obliged to prove anything. That was their business. Anyhow we are living together."</p>
<p>"Yes. Though not in their sense."</p>
<p>"One thing is certain, that however the decree may be brought about, a marriage is dissolved when it is dissolved. There is this advantage in being poor obscure people like us&#8212;that these things are done for us in a rough and ready fashion. It was the same with me and Arabella. I was afraid her criminal second marriage would have been discovered, and she punished; but nobody took any interest in her&#8212;nobody inquired, nobody suspected it. If we'd been patented nobilities we should have had infinite trouble, and days and weeks would have been spent in investigations."</p>
<p>By degrees Sue acquired her lover's cheerfulness at the sense of freedom, and proposed that they should take a walk in the fields, even if they had to put up with a cold dinner on account of it. Jude agreed, and Sue went up-stairs and prepared to start, putting on a joyful coloured gown in observance of her liberty; seeing which Jude put on a lighter tie.</p>
<p>"Now we'll strut arm and arm," he said, "like any other engaged couple. We've a legal right to."</p>
<p>They rambled out of the town, and along a path over the low-lying lands that bordered it, though these were frosty now, and the extensive seed-fields were bare of colour and produce. The pair, however, were so absorbed in their own situation that their surroundings were little in their consciousness.</p>
<p>"Well, my dearest, the result of all this is that we can marry after a decent interval."</p>
<p>"Yes; I suppose we can," said Sue, without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"And aren't we going to?"</p>
<p>"I don't like to say no, dear Jude; but I feel just the same about it now as I have done all along. I have just the same dread lest an iron contract should extinguish your tenderness for me, and mine for you, as it did between our unfortunate parents."</p>
<p>"Still, what can we do? I do love you, as you know, Sue."</p>
<p>"I know it abundantly. But I think I would much rather go on living always as lovers, as we are living now, and only meeting by day. It is so much sweeter&#8212;for the woman at least, and when she is sure of the man. And henceforward we needn't be so particular as we have been about appearances."</p>
<p>"Our experiences of matrimony with others have not been encouraging, I own," said he with some gloom; "either owing to our own dissatisfied, unpractical natures, or by our misfortune. But we two&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Should be two dissatisfied ones linked together, which would be twice as bad as before&#8230; I think I should begin to be afraid of you, Jude, the moment you had contracted to cherish me under a Government stamp, and I was licensed to be loved on the premises by you&#8212;Ugh, how horrible and sordid! Although, as you are, free, I trust you more than any other man in the world."</p>
<p>"No, no&#8212;don't say I should change!" he expostulated; yet there was misgiving in his own voice also.</p>
<p>"Apart from ourselves, and our unhappy peculiarities, it is foreign to a man's nature to go on loving a person when he is told that he must and shall be that person's lover. There would be a much likelier chance of his doing it if he were told not to love. If the marriage ceremony consisted in an oath and signed contract between the parties to cease loving from that day forward, in consideration of personal possession being given, and to avoid each other's society as much as possible in public, there would be more loving couples than there are now. Fancy the secret meetings between the perjuring husband and wife, the denials of having seen each other, the clambering in at bedroom windows, and the hiding in closets! There'd be little cooling then."</p>
<p>"Yes; but admitting this, or something like it, to be true, you are not the only one in the world to see it, dear little Sue. People go on marrying because they can't resist natural forces, although many of them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a month's pleasure with a life's discomfort. No doubt my father and mother, and your father and mother, saw it, if they at all resembled us in habits of observation. But then they went and married just the same, because they had ordinary passions. But you, Sue, are such a phantasmal, bodiless creature, one who&#8212;if you'll allow me to say it&#8212;has so little animal passion in you, that you can act upon reason in the matter, when we poor unfortunate wretches of grosser substance can't."</p>
<p>"Well," she sighed, "you've owned that it would probably end in misery for us. And I am not so exceptional a woman as you think. Fewer women like marriage than you suppose, only they enter into it for the dignity it is assumed to confer, and the social advantages it gains them sometimes&#8212;a dignity and an advantage that I am quite willing to do without."</p>
<p>Jude fell back upon his old complaint&#8212;that, intimate as they were, he had never once had from her an honest, candid declaration that she loved or could love him. "I really fear sometimes that you cannot," he said, with a dubiousness approaching anger. "And you are so reticent. I know that women are taught by other women that they must never admit the full truth to a man. But the highest form of affection is based on full sincerity on both sides. Not being men, these women don't know that in looking back on those he has had tender relations with, a man's heart returns closest to her who was the soul of truth in her conduct. The better class of man, even if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying, is not retained by them. A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of elusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her that, sooner or later, her old admirers feel; under which they allow her to go unlamented to her grave."</p>
<p>Sue, who was regarding the distance, had acquired a guilty look; and she suddenly replied in a tragic voice: "I don't think I like you to-day so well as I did, Jude!"</p>
<p>"Don't you? Why?"</p>
<p>"Oh, well&#8212;you are not nice&#8212;too sermony. Though I suppose I am so bad and worthless that I deserve the utmost rigour of lecturing!"</p>
<p>"No, you are not bad. You are a dear. But as slippery as an eel when I want to get a confession from you."</p>
<p>"Oh yes I am bad, and obstinate, and all sorts! It is no use your pretending I am not! People who are good don't want scolding as I do&#8230; But now that I have nobody but you, and nobody to defend me, it is very hard that I mustn't have my own way in deciding how I'll live with you, and whether I'll be married or no!"</p>
<p>"Sue, my own comrade and sweetheart, I don't want to force you either to marry or to do the other thing&#8212;of course I don't! It is too wicked of you to be so pettish! Now we won't say any more about it, and go on just the same as we have done; and during the rest of our walk we'll talk of the meadows only, and the floods, and the prospect of the farmers this coming year."</p>
<p>After this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for several days, though living as they were with only a landing between them it was constantly in their minds. Sue was assisting Jude very materially now: he had latterly occupied himself on his own account in working and lettering headstones, which he kept in a little yard at the back of his little house, where in the intervals of domestic duties she marked out the letters full size for him, and blacked them in after he had cut them. It was a lower class of handicraft than were his former performances as a cathedral mason, and his only patrons were the poor people who lived in his own neighbourhood, and knew what a cheap man this "Jude Fawley: Monumental Mason" (as he called himself on his front door) was to employ for the simple memorials they required for their dead. But he seemed more independent than before, and it was the only arrangement under which Sue, who particularly wished to be no burden on him, could render any assistance.</p>
<p>&#160;<a id="id_5-2"></a><br/>
&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00049">II</h2>
<p>It was an evening at the end of the month, and Jude had just returned home from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not far off. When he entered, Sue, who had been keeping indoors during his absence, laid out supper for him. Contrary to custom she did not speak. Jude had taken up some illustrated paper, which he perused till, raising his eyes, he saw that her face was troubled.</p>
<p>"Are you depressed, Sue?" he said.</p>
<p>She paused a moment. "I have a message for you," she answered.</p>
<p>"Somebody has called?"</p>
<p>"Yes. A woman." Sue's voice quavered as she spoke, and she suddenly sat down from her preparations, laid her hands in her lap, and looked into the fire. "I don't know whether I did right or not!" she continued. "I said you were not at home, and when she said she would wait, I said I thought you might not be able to see her."</p>
<p>"Why did you say that, dear? I suppose she wanted a headstone. Was she in mourning?"</p>
<p>"No. She wasn't in mourning, and she didn't want a headstone; and I thought you couldn't see her." Sue looked critically and imploringly at him.</p>
<p>"But who was she? Didn't she say?"</p>
<p>"No. She wouldn't give her name. But I know who she was&#8212;I think I do! It was Arabella!"</p>
<p>"Heaven save us! What should Arabella come for? What made you think it was she?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I can hardly tell. But I know it was! I feel perfectly certain it was&#8212;by the light in her eyes as she looked at me. She was a fleshy, coarse woman."</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;I should not have called Arabella coarse exactly, except in speech, though she may be getting so by this time under the duties of the public house. She was rather handsome when I knew her."</p>
<p>"Handsome! But yes!&#8212;so she is!"</p>
<p>"I think I heard a quiver in your little mouth. Well, waiving that, as she is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why should she come troubling us?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure she's married? Have you definite news of it?"</p>
<p>"No&#8212;not definite news. But that was why she asked me to release her. She and the man both wanted to lead a proper life, as I understood."</p>
<p>"Oh Jude&#8212;it was, it <i>was</i> Arabella!" cried Sue, covering her eyes with her hand. "And I am so miserable! It seems such an ill omen, whatever she may have come for. You could not possibly see her, could you?"</p>
<p>"I don't really think I could. It would be so very painful to talk to her now&#8212;for her as much as for me. However, she's gone. Did she say she would come again?"</p>
<p>"No. But she went away very reluctantly."</p>
<p>Sue, whom the least thing upset, could not eat any supper, and when Jude had finished his he prepared to go to bed. He had no sooner raked out the fire, fastened the doors, and got to the top of the stairs than there came a knock. Sue instantly emerged from her room, which she had but just entered.</p>
<p>"There she is again!" Sue whispered in appalled accents.</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"She knocked like that last time."</p>
<p>They listened, and the knocking came again. No servant was kept in the house, and if the summons were to be responded to one of them would have to do it in person. "I'll open a window," said Jude. "Whoever it is cannot be expected to be let in at this time."</p>
<p>He accordingly went into his bedroom and lifted the sash. The lonely street of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of one figure&#8212;that of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few yards off.</p>
<p>"Who's there?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Is that Mr. Fawley?" came up from the woman, in a voice which was unmistakably Arabella's.</p>
<p>Jude replied that it was.</p>
<p>"Is it she?" asked Sue from the door, with lips apart.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear," said Jude. "What do you want, Arabella?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, Jude, for disturbing you," said Arabella humbly. "But I called earlier&#8212;I wanted particularly to see you to-night, if I could. I am in trouble, and have nobody to help me!"</p>
<p>"In trouble, are you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>There was a silence. An inconvenient sympathy seemed to be rising in Jude's breast at the appeal. "But aren't you married?" he said.</p>
<p>Arabella hesitated. "No, Jude, I am not," she returned. "He wouldn't, after all. And I am in great difficulty. I hope to get another situation as barmaid soon. But it takes time, and I really am in great distress because of a sudden responsibility that's been sprung upon me from Australia; or I wouldn't trouble you&#8212;believe me I wouldn't. I want to tell you about it."</p>
<p>Sue remained at gaze, in painful tension, hearing every word, but speaking none.</p>
<p>"You are not really in want of money, Arabella?" he asked, in a distinctly softened tone.</p>
<p>"I have enough to pay for the night's lodging I have obtained, but barely enough to take me back again."</p>
<p>"Where are you living?"</p>
<p>"In London still." She was about to give the address, but she said, "I am afraid somebody may hear, so I don't like to call out particulars of myself so loud. If you could come down and walk a little way with me towards the Prince Inn, where I am staying to-night, I would explain all. You may as well, for old time's sake!"</p>
<p>"Poor thing! I must do her the kindness of hearing what's the matter, I suppose," said Jude in much perplexity. "As she's going back to-morrow it can't make much difference."</p>
<p>"But you can go and see her to-morrow, Jude! Don't go now, Jude!" came in plaintive accents from the doorway. "Oh, it is only to entrap you, I know it is, as she did before! Don't go, dear! She is such a low-passioned woman&#8212;I can see it in her shape, and hear it in her voice!</p>
<p>"But I shall go," said Jude. "Don't attempt to detain me, Sue. God knows I love her little enough now, but I don't want to be cruel to her." He turned to the stairs.</p>
<p>"But she's not your wife!" cried Sue distractedly. "And I&#8212;"</p>
<p>"And you are not either, dear, yet," said Jude.</p>
<p>"Oh, but are you going to her? Don't! Stay at home! Please, please stay at home, Jude, and not go to her, now she's not your wife any more than I!"</p>
<p>"Well, she is, rather more than you, come to that," he said, taking his hat determinedly. "I've wanted you to be, and I've waited with the patience of Job, and I don't see that I've got anything by my self-denial. I shall certainly give her something, and hear what it is she is so anxious to tell me; no man could do less!"</p>
<p>There was that in his manner which she knew it would be futile to oppose. She said no more, but, turning to her room as meekly as a martyr, heard him go downstairs, unbolt the door, and close it behind him. With a woman's disregard of her dignity when in the presence of nobody but herself, she also trotted down, sobbing articulately as she went. She listened. She knew exactly how far it was to the inn that Arabella had named as her lodging. It would occupy about seven minutes to get there at an ordinary walking pace; seven to come back again. If he did not return in fourteen minutes he would have lingered. She looked at the clock. It was twenty-five minutes to eleven. He <i>might</i> enter the inn with Arabella, as they would reach it before closing time; she might get him to drink with her; and Heaven only knew what disasters would befall him then.</p>
<p>In a still suspense she waited on. It seemed as if the whole time had nearly elapsed when the door was opened again, and Jude appeared.</p>
<p>Sue gave a little ecstatic cry. "Oh, I knew I could trust you!&#8212;how good you are!"&#8212;she began.</p>
<p>"I can't find her anywhere in this street, and I went out in my slippers only. She has walked on, thinking I've been so hard-hearted as to refuse her requests entirely, poor woman. I've come back for my boots, as it is beginning to rain."</p>
<p>"Oh, but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served you so badly!" said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment.</p>
<p>"But, Sue, she's a woman, and I once cared for her; and one can't be a brute in such circumstances."</p>
<p>"She isn't your wife any longer!" exclaimed Sue, passionately excited. "You <i>mustn't</i> go out to find her! It isn't right! You <i>can't</i> join her, now she's a stranger to you. How can you forget such a thing, my dear, dear one!"</p>
<p>"She seems much the same as ever&#8212;an erring, careless, unreflecting fellow-creature," he said, continuing to pull on his boots. "What those legal fellows have been playing at in London makes no difference in my real relations to her. If she was my wife while she was away in Australia with another husband she's my wife now."</p>
<p>"But she wasn't! That's just what I hold! There's the absurdity!&#8212; Well&#8212;you'll come straight back, after a few minutes, won't you, dear? She is too low, too coarse for you to talk to long, Jude, and was always!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I am coarse too, worse luck! I have the germs of every human infirmity in me, I verily believe&#8212;that was why I saw it was so preposterous of me to think of being a curate. I have cured myself of drunkenness I think; but I never know in what new form a suppressed vice will break out in me! I do love you, Sue, though I have danced attendance on you so long for such poor returns! All that's best and noblest in me loves you, and your freedom from everything that's gross has elevated me, and enabled me to do what I should never have dreamt myself capable of, or any man, a year or two ago. It is all very well to preach about self-control, and the wickedness of coercing a woman. But I should just like a few virtuous people who have condemned me in the past, about Arabella and other things, to have been in my tantalizing position with you through these late weeks!&#8212;they'd believe, I think, that I have exercised some little restraint in always giving in to your wishes&#8212;living here in one house, and not a soul between us."</p>
<p>"Yes, you have been good to me, Jude; I know you have, my dear protector."</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;Arabella has appealed to me for help. I must go out and speak to her, Sue, at least!"</p>
<p>"I can't say any more!&#8212;Oh, if you must, you must!" she said, bursting out into sobs that seemed to tear her heart. "I have nobody but you, Jude, and you are deserting me! I didn't know you were like this&#8212;I can't bear it, I can't! If she were yours it would be different!"</p>
<p>"Or if you were."</p>
<p>"Very well then&#8212;if I must I must. Since you will have it so, I agree! I will be. Only I didn't mean to! And I didn't want to marry again, either! &#8230; But, yes&#8212;I agree, I agree! I do love you. I ought to have known that you would conquer in the long run, living like this!"</p>
<p>She ran across and flung her arms round his neck. "I am not a cold-natured, sexless creature, am I, for keeping you at such a distance? I am sure you don't think so! Wait and see! I do belong to you, don't I? I give in!"</p>
<p>"And I'll arrange for our marriage to-morrow, or as soon as ever you wish."</p>
<p>"Yes, Jude."</p>
<p>"Then I'll let her go," said he, embracing Sue softly. "I do feel that it would be unfair to you to see her, and perhaps unfair to her. She is not like you, my darling, and never was: it is only bare justice to say that. Don't cry any more. There; and there; and there!" He kissed her on one side, and on the other, and in the middle, and rebolted the front door.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The next morning it was wet.</p>
<p>"Now, dear," said Jude gaily at breakfast; "as this is Saturday I mean to call about the banns at once, so as to get the first publishing done to-morrow, or we shall lose a week. Banns will do? We shall save a pound or two."</p>
<p>Sue absently agreed to banns. But her mind for the moment was running on something else. A glow had passed away from her, and depression sat upon her features.</p>
<p>"I feel I was wickedly selfish last night!" she murmured. "It was sheer unkindness in me&#8212;or worse&#8212;to treat Arabella as I did. I didn't care about her being in trouble, and what she wished to tell you! Perhaps it was really something she was justified in telling you. That's some more of my badness, I suppose! Love has its own dark morality when rivalry enters in&#8212;at least, mine has, if other people's hasn't&#8230; I wonder how she got on? I hope she reached the inn all right, poor woman."</p>
<p>"Oh yes: she got on all right," said Jude placidly.</p>
<p>"I hope she wasn't shut out, and that she hadn't to walk the streets in the rain. Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if she got in? I've been thinking of her all the morning."</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;is it necessary? You haven't the least idea how Arabella is able to shift for herself. Still, darling, if you want to go and inquire you can."</p>
<p>There was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which Sue would meekly undertake when in a contrite mood; and this going to see all sorts of extraordinary persons whose relation to her was precisely of a kind that would have made other people shun them was her instinct ever, so that the request did not surprise him.</p>
<p>"And when you come back," he added, "I'll be ready to go about the banns. You'll come with me?"</p>
<p>Sue agreed, and went off under cloak and umbrella letting Jude kiss her freely, and returning his kisses in a way she had never done before. Times had decidedly changed. "The little bird is caught at last!" she said, a sadness showing in her smile.</p>
<p>"No&#8212;only nested," he assured her.</p>
<p>She walked along the muddy street till she reached the public house mentioned by Arabella, which was not so very far off. She was informed that Arabella had not yet left, and in doubt how to announce herself so that her predecessor in Jude's affections would recognize her, she sent up word that a friend from Spring Street had called, naming the place of Jude's residence. She was asked to step upstairs, and on being shown into a room found that it was Arabella's bedroom, and that the latter had not yet risen. She halted on the turn of her toe till Arabella cried from the bed, "Come in and shut the door," which Sue accordingly did.</p>
<p>Arabella lay facing the window, and did not at once turn her head: and Sue was wicked enough, despite her penitence, to wish for a moment that Jude could behold her forerunner now, with the daylight full upon her. She may have seemed handsome enough in profile under the lamps, but a frowsiness was apparent this morning; and the sight of her own fresh charms in the looking-glass made Sue's manner bright, till she reflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in her, and hated herself for it.</p>
<p>"I've just looked in to see if you got back comfortably last night, that's all," she said gently. "I was afraid afterwards that you might have met with any mishap?"</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;how stupid this is! I thought my visitor was&#8212;your friend&#8212;your husband&#8212;Mrs. Fawley, as I suppose you call yourself?" said Arabella, flinging her head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss, and ceasing to retain the dimple she had just taken the trouble to produce.</p>
<p>"Indeed I don't," said Sue.</p>
<p>"Oh, I thought you might have, even if he's not really yours. Decency is decency, any hour of the twenty-four."</p>
<p>"I don't know what you mean," said Sue stiffly. "He is mine, if you come to that!"</p>
<p>"He wasn't yesterday."</p>
<p>Sue coloured roseate, and said, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>"From your manner when you talked to me at the door. Well, my dear, you've been quick about it, and I expect my visit last night helped it on&#8212;ha-ha! But I don't want to get him away from you."</p>
<p>Sue looked out at the rain, and at the dirty toilet-cover, and at the detached tail of Arabella's hair hanging on the looking-glass, just as it had done in Jude's time; and wished she had not come. In the pause there was a knock at the door, and the chambermaid brought in a telegram for "Mrs. Cartlett."</p>
<p>Arabella opened it as she lay, and her ruffled look disappeared.</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me," she said blandly when the maid had gone; "but it is not necessary you should feel it. My man finds he can't do without me after all, and agrees to stand by the promise to marry again over here that he has made me all along. See here! This is in answer to one from me." She held out the telegram for Sue to read, but Sue did not take it. "He asks me to come back. His little corner public in Lambeth would go to pieces without me, he says. But he isn't going to knock me about when he has had a drop, any more after we are spliced by English law than before! &#8230; As for you, I should coax Jude to take me before the parson straight off, and have done with it, if I were in your place. I say it as a friend, my dear."</p>
