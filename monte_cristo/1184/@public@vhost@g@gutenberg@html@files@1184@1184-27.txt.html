<p id="id07519">Noirtier was prepared to receive them, dressed in black, and installed
in his arm-chair. When the three persons he expected had entered, he
looked at the door, which his valet immediately closed.</p>

<p id="id07520">"Listen," whispered Villefort to Valentine, who could not conceal her
joy; "if M. Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay
your marriage, I forbid you to understand him." Valentine blushed,
but did not answer. Villefort, approaching Noirtier—"Here is M. Franz
d'Epinay," said he; "you requested to see him. We have all wished for
this interview, and I trust it will convince you how ill-formed are your
objections to Valentine's marriage."</p>

<p id="id07521">Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villefort's blood run cold.
He motioned to Valentine to approach. In a moment, thanks to her habit
of conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for a
key. Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the
windows. She opened the drawer, and found a key; and, understanding that
was what he wanted, again watched his eyes, which turned toward an old
secretary which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to
contain nothing but useless documents. "Shall I open the secretary?"
asked Valentine.</p>

<p id="id07522">"Yes," said the old man.</p>

<p id="id07523">"And the drawers?"</p>

<p id="id07524">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07525">"Those at the side?"</p>

<p id="id07526">"No."</p>

<p id="id07527">"The middle one?"</p>

<p id="id07528">"Yes." Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers. "Is that
what you wish for?" asked she.</p>

<p id="id07529">"No."</p>

<p id="id07530">She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was
empty. "But there are no more," said she. Noirtier's eye was fixed on
the dictionary. "Yes, I understand, grandfather," said the young girl.</p>

<p id="id07531">He pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man
stopped her. She opened, and found the word "secret."</p>

<p id="id07532">"Ah, is there a secret spring?" said Valentine.</p>

<p id="id07533">"Yes," said Noirtier.</p>

<p id="id07534">"And who knows it?" Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had
gone out. "Barrois?" said she.</p>

<p id="id07535">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07536">"Shall I call him?"</p>

<p id="id07537">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07538">Valentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefort's impatience
during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and
Franz was stupefied. The old servant came. "Barrois," said Valentine,
"my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretary, but
there is a secret spring in it, which you know—will you open it?"</p>

<p id="id07539">Barrois looked at the old man. "Obey," said Noirtier's intelligent eye.
Barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a
bundle of papers tied with a black string.</p>

<p id="id07540">"Is that what you wish for?" said Barrois.</p>

<p id="id07541">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07542">"Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?"</p>

<p id="id07543">"No."</p>

<p id="id07544">"To Mademoiselle Valentine?"</p>

<p id="id07545">"No."</p>

<p id="id07546">"To M. Franz d'Epinay?"</p>

<p id="id07547">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07548">Franz, astonished, advanced a step. "To me, sir?" said he.</p>

<p id="id07549">"Yes." Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover,
read:—</p>

<p id="id07550">"'To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall bequeath the
packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing an
important document.'</p>

<p id="id07551">"Well, sir," asked Franz, "what do you wish me to do with this paper?"</p>

<p id="id07552">"To preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless," said the procureur.</p>

<p id="id07553">"No," replied Noirtier eagerly.</p>

<p id="id07554">"Do you wish him to read it?" said Valentine.</p>

<p id="id07555">"Yes," replied the old man. "You understand, baron, my grandfather
wishes you to read this paper," said Valentine.</p>

<p id="id07556">"Then let us sit down," said Villefort impatiently, "for it will take
some time."</p>

<p id="id07557">"Sit down," said the old man. Villefort took a chair, but Valentine
remained standing by her father's side, and Franz before him, holding
the mysterious paper in his hand. "Read," said the old man. Franz untied
it, and in the midst of the most profound silence read:</p>

<p id="id07558">"'Extract from the Report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the<br/>

Rue Saint-Jacques, held February 5th, 1815.'"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07559">Franz stopped. "February 5th, 1815!" said he; "it is the day my father
was murdered." Valentine and Villefort were dumb; the eye of the old man
alone seemed to say clearly, "Go on."</p>

<p id="id07560">"But it was on leaving this club," said he, "my father disappeared."<br/>

Noirtier's eye continued to say, "Read." He resumed:—<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07561">"'The undersigned Louis Jacques Beaurepaire, lieutenant-colonel of
artillery, Etienne Duchampy, general of brigade, and Claude Lecharpal,
keeper of woods and forests, Declare, that on the 4th of February, a
letter arrived from the Island of Elba, recommending to the kindness and
the confidence of the Bonapartist Club, General Flavien de Quesnel, who
having served the emperor from 1804. to 1814 was supposed to be devoted
to the interests of the Napoleon dynasty, notwithstanding the title
of baron which Louis XVIII. had just granted to him with his estate of
Epinay.</p>

<p id="id07562">"'A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel, begging
him to be present at the meeting next day, the 5th. The note indicated
neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to
be held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that
some one would call for him if he would be ready at nine o'clock. The
meetings were always held from that time till midnight. At nine o'clock
the president of the club presented himself; the general was ready, the
president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction
was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting, and
that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged, swearing that he would
not endeavor to take off the bandage. General de Quesnel accepted the
condition, and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road
they took. The general's carriage was ready, but the president told him
it was impossible for him to use it, since it was useless to blindfold
the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went. "What must
be done then?" asked the general.—"I have my carriage here," said the
president.</p>

<p id="id07563">"'"Have you, then, so much confidence in your servant that you can
intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know?"</p>

<p id="id07564">"'"Our coachman is a member of the club," said the president; "we shall
be driven by a State-Councillor."</p>

<p id="id07565">"'"Then we run another risk," said the general, laughing, "that of being
upset." We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the
least compelled to attend the meeting, but that he came willingly. When
they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general
of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged, to which he made no
opposition. On the road the president thought he saw the general make an
attempt to remove the handkerchief, and reminded him of his oath. "Sure
enough," said the general. The carriage stopped at an alley leading out
of the Rue Saint-Jacques. The general alighted, leaning on the arm of
the president, of whose dignity he was not aware, considering him simply
as a member of the club; they went through the alley, mounted a flight
of stairs, and entered the assembly-room.</p>

<p id="id07566">"'The deliberations had already begun. The members, apprised of the
sort of presentation which was to be made that evening, were all in
attendance. When in the middle of the room the general was invited to
remove his bandage, he did so immediately, and was surprised to see so
many well-known faces in a society of whose existence he had till
then been ignorant. They questioned him as to his sentiments, but he
contented himself with answering, that the letters from the Island of
Elba ought to have informed them'"—</p>

<p id="id07567">Franz interrupted himself by saying, "My father was a royalist; they
need not have asked his sentiments, which were well known."</p>

<p id="id07568">"And hence," said Villefort, "arose my affection for your father, my
dear M. Franz. Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union."</p>

<p id="id07569">"Read again," said the old man. Franz continued:—</p>

<p id="id07570">"'The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly, but M. de
Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him.
He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of
Elba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be
likely to advance the interests of their party. One paragraph spoke of
the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details,
on the arrival of the Pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel, of
Marseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor. During
all this time, the general, on whom they thought to have relied as on a
brother, manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance. When
the reading was finished, he remained silent, with knitted brows.</p>

<p id="id07571">"'"Well," asked the president, "what do you say to this letter,
general?"</p>

<p id="id07572">"'"I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII. to
break my vow in behalf of the ex-emperor." This answer was too clear
to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments. "General," said the
president, "we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII., or an ex-emperor,
but his majesty the emperor and king, driven from France, which is his
kingdom, by violence and treason."</p>

<p id="id07573">"'"Excuse me, gentlemen," said the general; "you may not acknowledge
Louis XVIII., but I do, as he has made me a baron and a field-marshal,
and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his
happy return to France."</p>

<p id="id07574">"'"Sir," said the president, rising with gravity, "be careful what you
say; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you
in the Island of Elba, and have deceived us! The communication has been
made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you, and which
does you honor. Now we discover our error; a title and promotion attach
you to the government we wish to overturn. We will not constrain you to
help us; we enroll no one against his conscience, but we will compel you
to act generously, even if you are not disposed to do so."</p>

<p id="id07575">"'"You would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy and
not informing against you, that is what I should call becoming your
accomplice. You see I am more candid than you."'"</p>

<p id="id07576">"Ah, my father!" said Franz, interrupting himself. "I understand now why
they murdered him." Valentine could not help casting one glance towards
the young man, whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold.
Villefort walked to and fro behind them. Noirtier watched the expression
of each one, and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude. Franz
returned to the manuscript, and continued:—</p>

<p id="id07577">"'"Sir," said the president, "you have been invited to join this
assembly—you were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come
blindfolded—you accepted. When you complied with this twofold request
you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII., or
we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police. It
would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you
in the discovery of our secret, and then to remove it that you may
ruin those who have confided in you. No, no, you must first say if
you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns, or for his
majesty the emperor."</p>

<p id="id07578">"'"I am a royalist," replied the general; "I have taken the oath of
allegiance to Louis XVIII., and I will adhere to it." These words were
followed by a general murmur, and it was evident that several of the
members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of
his rashness.</p>

<p id="id07579">"'The president again arose, and having imposed silence, said,—"Sir,
you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the
consequences of our present situation, and your candor has already
dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you." The
general, putting his hand on his sword, exclaimed,—"If you talk of
honor, do not begin by disavowing its laws, and impose nothing by
violence."</p>

<p id="id07580">"'"And you, sir," continued the president, with a calmness still more
terrible than the general's anger, "I advise you not to touch your
sword." The general looked around him with slight uneasiness; however
he did not yield, but calling up all his fortitude, said,—"I will not
swear."</p>

<p id="id07581">"'"Then you must die," replied the president calmly. M. d'Epinay became
very pale; he looked round him a second time, several members of the
club were whispering, and getting their arms from under their cloaks.
"General," said the president, "do not alarm yourself; you are among men
of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to
the last extremity, but as you have said, you are among conspirators,
you are in possession of our secret, and you must restore it to us."
A significant silence followed these words, and as the general did not
reply,—"Close the doors," said the president to the door-keeper.</p>

<p id="id07582">"'The same deadly silence succeeded these words. Then the general
advanced, and making a violent effort to control his feelings,—"I have
a son," said he, "and I ought to think of him, finding myself among
assassins."</p>

<p id="id07583">"'"General," said the chief of the assembly, "one man may insult
fifty—it is the privilege of weakness. But he does wrong to use his
privilege. Follow my advice, swear, and do not insult." The general,
again daunted by the superiority of the chief, hesitated a moment; then
advancing to the president's desk,—"What is the form, said he.</p>

<p id="id07584">"'"It is this:—'I swear by my honor not to reveal to any one what I
have seen and heard on the 5th of February, 1815, between nine and
ten o'clock in the evening; and I plead guilty of death should I ever
violate this oath.'" The general appeared to be affected by a nervous
tremor, which prevented his answering for some moments; then, overcoming
his manifest repugnance, he pronounced the required oath, but in so low
a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members, who
insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly, which he did.</p>

<p id="id07585">"'"Now am I at liberty to retire?" said the general. The president rose,
appointed three members to accompany him, and got into the carriage with
the general after bandaging his eyes. One of those three members was
the coachman who had driven them there. The other members
silently dispersed. "Where do you wish to be taken?" asked the
president.—"Anywhere out of your presence," replied M. d'Epinay.
"Beware, sir," replied the president, "you are no longer in the
assembly, and have only to do with individuals; do not insult them
unless you wish to be held responsible." But instead of listening, M.
d'Epinay went on,—"You are still as brave in your carriage as in your
assembly because you are still four against one." The president stopped
the coach. They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps
lead down to the river. "Why do you stop here?" asked d'Epinay.</p>

<p id="id07586">"'"Because, sir," said the president, "you have insulted a man, and
that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable
reparation."</p>

<p id="id07587">"'"Another method of assassination?" said the general, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p id="id07588">"'"Make no noise, sir, unless you wish me to consider you as one of the
men of whom you spoke just now as cowards, who take their weakness for
a shield. You are alone, one alone shall answer you; you have a sword
by your side, I have one in my cane; you have no witness, one of these
gentlemen will serve you. Now, if you please, remove your bandage."
The general tore the handkerchief from his eyes. "At last," said he, "I
shall know with whom I have to do." They opened the door and the four
men alighted.'"</p>

<p id="id07589">Franz again interrupted himself, and wiped the cold drops from his brow;
there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling
pallor these details of his father's death, which had hitherto been a
mystery. Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer. Noirtier looked at
Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride. Franz
continued:—</p>

<p id="id07590">"'It was, as we said, the fifth of February. For three days the mercury
had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered
with ice. The general was stout and tall, the president offered him the
side of the railing to assist him in getting down. The two witnesses
followed. It was a dark night. The ground from the steps to the river
was covered with snow and hoarfrost, the water of the river looked black
and deep. One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal-barge near,
and by its light they examined the weapons. The president's sword, which
was simply, as he had said, one he carried in his cane, was five inches
shorter than the general's, and had no guard. The general proposed to
cast lots for the swords, but the president said it was he who had given
the provocation, and when he had given it he had supposed each would use
his own arms. The witnesses endeavored to insist, but the president
bade them be silent. The lantern was placed on the ground, the two
adversaries took their stations, and the duel began. The light made the
two swords appear like flashes of lightning; as for the men, they were
scarcely perceptible, the darkness was so great.</p>

<p id="id07591">"'General d'Epinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army, but
he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell.
The witnesses thought he was dead, but his adversary, who knew he had
not struck him, offered him the assistance of his hand to rise. The
circumstance irritated instead of calming the general, and he rushed on
his adversary. But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken.
He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on
finding himself too closely engaged, and then returned to the charge. At
the third he fell again. They thought he slipped, as at first, and the
witnesses, seeing he did not move, approached and endeavored to raise
him, but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was
moistened with blood. The general, who had almost fainted, revived.
"Ah," said he, "they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me."
The president, without answering, approached the witness who held the
lantern, and raising his sleeve, showed him two wounds he had received
in his arm; then opening his coat, and unbuttoning his waistcoat,
displayed his side, pierced with a third wound. Still he had not even
uttered a sigh. General d'Epinay died five minutes after.'"</p>

<p id="id07592">Franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly
audible, and then stopped, passing his hand over his eyes as if to
dispel a cloud; but after a moment's silence, he continued:—</p>

<p id="id07593">"'The president went up the steps, after pushing his sword into his
cane; a track of blood on the snow marked his course. He had scarcely
arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water—it was the
general's body, which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after
ascertaining that he was dead. The general fell, then, in a loyal duel,
and not in ambush as it might have been reported. In proof of this we
have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts, lest the
moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene
should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws
of honor.</p>

<p id="id07594">"'Signed, Beaurepaire, Deschamps, and Lecharpal.'"</p>

<p id="id07595">When Franz had finished reading this account, so dreadful for a
son; when Valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear; when
Villefort, trembling, and crouched in a corner, had endeavored to lessen
the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man,—"Sir,"
said d'Epinay to Noirtier, "since you are well acquainted with all these
details, which are attested by honorable signatures,—since you appear
to take some interest in me, although you have only manifested
it hitherto by causing me sorrow, refuse me not one final
satisfaction—tell me the name of the president of the club, that I may
at least know who killed my father." Villefort mechanically felt for
the handle of the door; Valentine, who understood sooner than anyone her
grandfather's answer, and who had often seen two scars upon his right
arm, drew back a few steps. "Mademoiselle," said Franz, turning towards
Valentine, "unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man
who made me an orphan at two years of age." Valentine remained dumb and
motionless.</p>

<p id="id07596">"Hold, sir," said Villefort, "do not prolong this dreadful scene. The
names have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know who
this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper names
are not in the dictionary."</p>

<p id="id07597">"Oh, misery," cried Franz: "the only hope which sustained me and enabled
me to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name of him who
killed my father! Sir, sir," cried he, turning to Noirtier, "do what you
can—make me understand in some way!"</p>

<p id="id07598">"Yes," replied Noirtier.</p>

<p id="id07599">"Oh, mademoiselle,—mademoiselle!" cried Franz, "your grandfather says
he can indicate the person. Help me,—lend me your assistance!" Noirtier
looked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a nervous trembling, and
repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until he came to M.
At that letter the old man signified "Yes."</p>

<p id="id07600">"M," repeated Franz. The young man's finger, glided over the words, but
at each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine hid her head
between her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word MYSELF.</p>

<p id="id07601">"Yes!"</p>

<p id="id07602">"You?" cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; "you, M. Noirtier—you
killed my father?"</p>

<p id="id07603">"Yes!" replied Noirtier, fixing a majestic look on the young man. Franz
fell powerless on a chair; Villefort opened the door and escaped, for
the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the
heart of this terrible old man.</p>

<h3 id="id07604" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 76. Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger.</h3>

<p id="id07605">Meanwhile M. Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in
the army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table
of the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous
courtiers. He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his
journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had
maintained his assumed character of father. M. Andrea at his departure
inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor
of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva
Corsinari. He was now fairly launched in that Parisian society which
gives such ready access to foreigners, and treats them, not as they
really are, but as they wish to be considered. Besides, what is required
of a young man in Paris? To speak its language tolerably, to make a
good appearance, to be a good gamester, and to pay in cash. They are
certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a Frenchman. Andrea
had, then, in a fortnight, attained a very fair position. He was called
count, he was said to possess 50,000 livres per annum; and his father's
immense riches, buried in the quarries of Saravezza, were a constant
theme. A learned man, before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as
a fact, declared he had seen the quarries in question, which gave great
weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful, but which now assumed
the garb of reality.</p>

<p id="id07606">Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our
readers, when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M. Danglars a visit.
M. Danglars was out, but the count was asked to go and see the baroness,
and he accepted the invitation. It was never without a nervous shudder,
since the dinner at Auteuil, and the events which followed it, that
Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristo's name announced. If he did not
come, the painful sensation became most intense; if, on the contrary, he
appeared, his noble countenance, his brilliant eyes, his amiability,
his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars, soon dispelled every
impression of fear. It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of
such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against
her; besides, the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would
answer some interested end—useless injury is repugnant to every mind.
When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir,—to which we have already once
introduced our readers, and where the baroness was examining some
drawings, which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them
with M. Cavalcanti,—his presence soon produced its usual effect, and it
was with smiles that the baroness received the count, although she had
been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name. The latter
took in the whole scene at a glance.</p>

<p id="id07607">The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa, Eugenie sat near her,
and Cavalcanti was standing. Cavalcanti, dressed in black, like one
of Goethe's heroes, with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked
stockings, passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his
light hair, and so displayed a sparkling diamond, that in spite of Monte
Cristo's advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on
his little finger. This movement was accompanied by killing glances
at Mademoiselle Danglars, and by sighs launched in the same direction.
Mademoiselle Danglars was still the same—cold, beautiful, and
satirical. Not one of these glances, nor one sigh, was lost on her;
they might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva, which some
philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sappho. Eugenie
bowed coldly to the count, and availed herself of the first moment when
the conversation became earnest to escape to her study, whence very soon
two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional
notes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars
preferred to his society and to that of M. Cavalcanti the company of
Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly, her singing teacher.</p>

<p id="id07608">It was then, especially while conversing with Madame Danglars, and
apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation, that the count
noticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti's solicitude, his manner of listening
to the music at the door he dared not pass, and of manifesting his
admiration. The banker soon returned. His first look was certainly
directed towards Monte Cristo, but the second was for Andrea. As for his
wife, he bowed to her, as some husbands do to their wives, but in a way
that bachelors will never comprehend, until a very extensive code is
published on conjugal life.</p>

<p id="id07609">"Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano?" said
Danglars to Andrea. "Alas, no, sir," replied Andrea with a sigh, still
more remarkable than the former ones. Danglars immediately advanced
towards the door and opened it.</p>

<p id="id07610">The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair, at the piano,
accompanying themselves, each with one hand, a fancy to which they had
accustomed themselves, and performed admirably. Mademoiselle d'Armilly,
whom they then perceived through the open doorway, formed with Eugenie
one of the tableaux vivants of which the Germans are so fond. She was
somewhat beautiful, and exquisitely formed—a little fairy-like figure,
with large curls falling on her neck, which was rather too long, as
Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins, and her eyes dull from fatigue.
She was said to have a weak chest, and like Antonia in the "Cremona
Violin," she would die one day while singing. Monte Cristo cast one
rapid and curious glance round this sanctum; it was the first time he
had ever seen Mademoiselle d'Armilly, of whom he had heard much. "Well,"
said the banker to his daughter, "are we then all to be excluded?" He
then led the young man into the study, and either by chance or manoeuvre
the door was partially closed after Andrea, so that from the place where
they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see anything; but as
the banker had accompanied Andrea, Madame Danglars appeared to take no
notice of it.</p>

<p id="id07611">The count soon heard Andrea's voice, singing a Corsican song,
accompanied by the piano. While the count smiled at hearing this song,
which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto,
Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband's strength
of mind, who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand
francs by a failure at Milan. The praise was well deserved, for had not
the count heard it from the baroness, or by one of those means by which
he knew everything, the baron's countenance would not have led him
to suspect it. "Hem," thought Monte Cristo, "he begins to conceal his
losses; a month since he boasted of them." Then aloud,—"Oh, madame, M.
Danglars is so skilful, he will soon regain at the Bourse what he loses
elsewhere."</p>

<p id="id07612">"I see that you participate in a prevalent error," said Madame Danglars.<br/>

"What is it?" said Monte Cristo.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07613">"That M. Danglars speculates, whereas he never does."</p>

<p id="id07614">"Truly, madame, I recollect M. Debray told me—apropos, what is become
of him? I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days."</p>

<p id="id07615">"Nor I," said Madame Danglars; "but you began a sentence, sir, and did
not finish."</p>

<p id="id07616">"Which?"</p>

<p id="id07617">"M. Debray had told you"—</p>

<p id="id07618">"Ah, yes; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of
speculation."</p>

<p id="id07619">"I was once very fond of it, but I do not indulge now."</p>

<p id="id07620">"Then you are wrong, madame. Fortune is precarious; and if I were
a woman and fate had made me a banker's wife, whatever might be my
confidence in my husband's good fortune, still in speculation you
know there is great risk. Well, I would secure for myself a fortune
independent of him, even if I acquired it by placing my interests in
hands unknown to him." Madame Danglars blushed, in spite of all her
efforts. "Stay," said Monte Cristo, as though he had not observed her
confusion, "I have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the
Neapolitan bonds."</p>

<p id="id07621">"I have none—nor have I ever possessed any; but really we have talked
long enough of money, count, we are like two stockbrokers; have you
heard how fate is persecuting the poor Villeforts?"</p>

<p id="id07622">"What has happened?" said the count, simulating total ignorance.</p>

<p id="id07623">"You know the Marquis of Saint-Meran died a few days after he had set
out on his journey to Paris, and the marchioness a few days after her
arrival?"</p>

<p id="id07624">"Yes," said Monte Cristo, "I have heard that; but, as Claudius said to
Hamlet, 'it is a law of nature; their fathers died before them, and they
mourned their loss; they will die before their children, who will, in
their turn, grieve for them.'"</p>

<p id="id07625">"But that is not all."</p>

<p id="id07626">"Not all!"</p>

<p id="id07627">"No; they were going to marry their daughter"—</p>

<p id="id07628">"To M. Franz d'Epinay. Is it broken off?"</p>

<p id="id07629">"Yesterday morning, it appears, Franz declined the honor."</p>

<p id="id07630">"Indeed? And is the reason known?"</p>

<p id="id07631">"No."</p>

<p id="id07632">"How extraordinary! And how does M. de Villefort bear it?"</p>

<p id="id07633">"As usual. Like a philosopher." Danglars returned at this moment
alone. "Well," said the baroness, "do you leave M. Cavalcanti with your
daughter?"</p>

<p id="id07634">"And Mademoiselle d'Armilly," said the banker; "do you consider her no
one?" Then, turning to Monte Cristo, he said, "Prince Cavalcanti is a
charming young man, is he not? But is he really a prince?"</p>

<p id="id07635">"I will not answer for it," said Monte Cristo. "His father was
introduced to me as a marquis, so he ought to be a count; but I do not
think he has much claim to that title."</p>

<p id="id07636">"Why?" said the banker. "If he is a prince, he is wrong not to maintain
his rank; I do not like any one to deny his origin."</p>

<p id="id07637">"Oh, you are a thorough democrat," said Monte Cristo, smiling.</p>

<p id="id07638">"But do you see to what you are exposing yourself?" said the baroness.
"If, perchance, M. de Morcerf came, he would find M. Cavalcanti in that
room, where he, the betrothed of Eugenie, has never been admitted."</p>

<p id="id07639">"You may well say, perchance," replied the banker; "for he comes so
seldom, it would seem only chance that brings him."</p>

<p id="id07640">"But should he come and find that young man with your daughter, he might
be displeased."</p>

<p id="id07641">"He? You are mistaken. M. Albert would not do us the honor to be
jealous; he does not like Eugenie sufficiently. Besides, I care not for
his displeasure."</p>

<p id="id07642">"Still, situated as we are"—</p>

<p id="id07643">"Yes, do you know how we are situated? At his mother's ball he danced
once with Eugenie, and M. Cavalcanti three times, and he took no notice
of it." The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf. The baroness
rose hastily, and was going into the study, when Danglars stopped her.
"Let her alone," said he. She looked at him in amazement. Monte Cristo
appeared to be unconscious of what passed. Albert entered, looking
very handsome and in high spirits. He bowed politely to the baroness,
familiarly to Danglars, and affectionately to Monte Cristo. Then turning
to the baroness: "May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is?" said he.</p>

<p id="id07644">"She is quite well," replied Danglars quickly; "she is at the piano
with M. Cavalcanti." Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner; he
might feel perhaps annoyed, but he knew Monte Cristo's eye was on him.
"M. Cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice," said he, "and Mademoiselle
Eugenie a splendid soprano, and then she plays the piano like Thalberg.
The concert must be a delightful one."</p>

<p id="id07645">"They suit each other remarkably well," said Danglars. Albert appeared
not to notice this remark, which was, however, so rude that Madame
Danglars blushed.</p>

<p id="id07646">"I, too," said the young man, "am a musician—at least, my masters used
to tell me so; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any
other, and a soprano less than any." Danglars smiled, and seemed to say,
"It is of no consequence." Then, hoping doubtless to effect his
purpose, he said,—"The prince and my daughter were universally admired
yesterday. You were not of the party, M. de Morcerf?"</p>

<p id="id07647">"What prince?" asked Albert. "Prince Cavalcanti," said Danglars, who
persisted in giving the young man that title.</p>

<p id="id07648">"Pardon me," said Albert, "I was not aware that he was a prince. And
Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugenie yesterday? It must have
been charming, indeed. I regret not having heard them. But I was unable
to accept your invitation, having promised to accompany my mother to
a German concert given by the Baroness of Chateau-Renaud." This was
followed by rather an awkward silence. "May I also be allowed," said
Morcerf, "to pay my respects to Mademoiselle Danglars?" "Wait a moment,"
said the banker, stopping the young man; "do you hear that delightful
cavatina? Ta, ta, ta, ti, ta, ti, ta, ta; it is charming, let them
finish—one moment. Bravo, bravi, brava!" The banker was enthusiastic in
his applause.</p>

<p id="id07649">"Indeed," said Albert, "it is exquisite; it is impossible to understand
the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti does. You said
prince, did you not? But he can easily become one, if he is not
already; it is no uncommon thing in Italy. But to return to the charming
musicians—you should give us a treat, Danglars, without telling them
there is a stranger. Ask them to sing one more song; it is so delightful
to hear music in the distance, when the musicians are unrestrained by
observation."</p>

<p id="id07650">Danglars was quite annoyed by the young man's indifference. He took<br/>

Monte Cristo aside. "What do you think of our lover?" said he.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07651">"He appears cool. But, then your word is given."</p>

<p id="id07652">"Yes, doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves
her, but not to one who does not. See him there, cold as marble and
proud like his father. If he were rich, if he had Cavalcanti's fortune,
that might be pardoned. Ma foi, I haven't consulted my daughter; but if
she has good taste"—</p>

<p id="id07653">"Oh," said Monte Cristo, "my fondness may blind me, but I assure you
I consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter
happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction,
and his father's position is good."</p>

<p id="id07654">"Hem," said Danglars.</p>

<p id="id07655">"Why do you doubt?"</p>

<p id="id07656">"The past—that obscurity on the past."</p>

<p id="id07657">"But that does not affect the son."</p>

<p id="id07658">"Very true."</p>

<p id="id07659">"Now, I beg of you, don't go off your head. It's a month now that you
have been thinking of this marriage, and you must see that it throws
some responsibility on me, for it was at my house you met this young
Cavalcanti, whom I do not really know at all."</p>

<p id="id07660">"But I do."</p>

<p id="id07661">"Have you made inquiry?"</p>

<p id="id07662">"Is there any need of that! Does not his appearance speak for him? And
he is very rich."</p>

<p id="id07663">"I am not so sure of that."</p>

<p id="id07664">"And yet you said he had money."</p>

<p id="id07665">"Fifty thousand livres—a mere trifle."</p>

<p id="id07666">"He is well educated."</p>

<p id="id07667">"Hem," said Monte Cristo in his turn.</p>

<p id="id07668">"He is a musician."</p>

<p id="id07669">"So are all Italians."</p>

<p id="id07670">"Come, count, you do not do that young man justice."</p>

<p id="id07671">"Well, I acknowledge it annoys me, knowing your connection with the
Morcerf family, to see him throw himself in the way." Danglars burst out
laughing. "What a Puritan you are!" said he; "that happens every day."</p>

<p id="id07672">"But you cannot break it off in this way; the Morcerfs are depending on
this union."</p>

<p id="id07673">"Indeed."</p>

<p id="id07674">"Positively."</p>

<p id="id07675">"Then let them explain themselves; you should give the father a hint,
you are so intimate with the family."</p>

<p id="id07676">"I?—where the devil did you find out that?"</p>

<p id="id07677">"At their ball; it was apparent enough. Why, did not the countess, the
proud Mercedes, the disdainful Catalane, who will scarcely open her lips
to her oldest acquaintances, take your arm, lead you into the garden,
into the private walks, and remain there for half an hour?"</p>

<p id="id07678">"Ah, baron, baron," said Albert, "you are not listening—what barbarism
in a megalomaniac like you!"</p>

<p id="id07679">"Oh, don't worry about me, Sir Mocker," said Danglars; then turning to
the count he said, "but will you undertake to speak to the father?"</p>

<p id="id07680">"Willingly, if you wish it."</p>

<p id="id07681">"But let it be done explicitly and positively. If he demands my daughter
let him fix the day—declare his conditions; in short, let us either
understand each other, or quarrel. You understand—no more delay."</p>

<p id="id07682">"Yes, sir, I will give my attention to the subject."</p>

<p id="id07683">"I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision, but I do await
it. A banker must, you know, be a slave to his promise." And Danglars
sighed as M. Cavalcanti had done half an hour before. "Bravi, bravo,
brava!" cried Morcerf, parodying the banker, as the selection came to an
end. Danglars began to look suspiciously at Morcerf, when some one came
and whispered a few words to him. "I shall soon return," said the banker
to Monte Cristo; "wait for me. I shall, perhaps, have something to say
to you." And he went out.</p>

<p id="id07684">The baroness took advantage of her husband's absence to push open the
door of her daughter's study, and M. Andrea, who was sitting before
the piano with Mademoiselle Eugenie, started up like a jack-in-the-box.
Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars, who did not appear
in the least disturbed, and returned his bow with her usual coolness.
Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed; he bowed to Morcerf, who replied
with the most impertinent look possible. Then Albert launched out in
praise of Mademoiselle Danglars' voice, and on his regret, after what
he had just heard, that he had been unable to be present the previous
evening. Cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id07685">"Come," said Madame Danglars, "leave music and compliments, and let us
go and take tea."</p>

<p id="id07686">"Come, Louise," said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend. They passed
into the next drawing-room, where tea was prepared. Just as they were
beginning, in the English fashion, to leave the spoons in their cups,
the door again opened and Danglars entered, visibly agitated. Monte
Cristo observed it particularly, and by a look asked the banker for
an explanation. "I have just received my courier from Greece," said
Danglars.</p>

<p id="id07687">"Ah, yes," said the count; "that was the reason of your running away
from us."</p>

<p id="id07688">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07689">"How is King Otho getting on?" asked Albert in the most sprightly tone.
Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering, and
Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which
passed over his features, but which was gone in a moment. "We shall go
together, shall we not?" said Albert to the count.</p>

<p id="id07690">"If you like," replied the latter. Albert could not understand
the banker's look, and turning to Monte Cristo, who understood it
perfectly,—"Did you see," said he, "how he looked at me?"</p>

<p id="id07691">"Yes," said the count; "but did you think there was anything particular
in his look?"</p>

<p id="id07692">"Indeed, I did; and what does he mean by his news from Greece?"</p>

<p id="id07693">"How can I tell you?"</p>

<p id="id07694">"Because I imagine you have correspondents in that country." Monte<br/>

Cristo smiled significantly.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07695">"Stop," said Albert, "here he comes. I shall compliment Mademoiselle<br/>

Danglars on her cameo, while the father talks to you."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07696">"If you compliment her at all, let it be on her voice, at least," said<br/>

Monte Cristo.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07697">"No, every one would do that."</p>

<p id="id07698">"My dear viscount, you are dreadfully impertinent." Albert advanced
towards Eugenie, smiling. Meanwhile, Danglars, stooping to Monte
Cristo's ear, "Your advice was excellent," said he; "there is a whole
history connected with the names Fernand and Yanina."</p>

<p id="id07699">"Indeed?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id07700">"Yes, I will tell you all; but take away the young man; I cannot endure
his presence."</p>

<p id="id07701">"He is going with me. Shall I send the father to you?"</p>

<p id="id07702">"Immediately."</p>

<p id="id07703">"Very well." The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to
the ladies, and took their leave, Albert perfectly indifferent to
Mademoiselle Danglars' contempt, Monte Cristo reiterating his advice
to Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker's wife should exercise in
providing for the future. M. Cavalcanti remained master of the field.</p>

<h3 id="id07704" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 77. Haidee.</h3>

<p id="id07705">Scarcely had the count's horses cleared the angle of the boulevard,
than Albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of
laughter—much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather
forced and unnatural. "Well," said he, "I will ask you the same question
which Charles IX. put to Catherine de Medicis, after the massacre of
Saint Bartholomew, 'How have I played my little part?'"</p>

<p id="id07706">"To what do you allude?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id07707">"To the installation of my rival at M. Danglars'."</p>

<p id="id07708">"What rival?"</p>

<p id="id07709">"Ma foi, what rival? Why, your protege, M. Andrea Cavalcanti!"</p>

<p id="id07710">"Ah, no joking, viscount, if you please; I do not patronize M.<br/>

Andrea—at least, not as concerns M. Danglars."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07711">"And you would be to blame for not assisting him, if the young man
really needed your help in that quarter, but, happily for me, he can
dispense with it."</p>

<p id="id07712">"What, do you think he is paying his addresses?"</p>

<p id="id07713">"I am certain of it; his languishing looks and modulated tones when
addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions. He
aspires to the hand of the proud Eugenie."</p>

<p id="id07714">"What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?"</p>

<p id="id07715">"But it is not the case, my dear count: on the contrary. I am repulsed
on all sides."</p>

<p id="id07716">"What!"</p>

<p id="id07717">"It is so indeed; Mademoiselle Eugenie scarcely answers me, and<br/>

Mademoiselle d'Armilly, her confidant, does not speak to me at all."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07718">"But the father has the greatest regard possible for you," said Monte<br/>

Cristo.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07719">"He? Oh, no, he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart,
tragedy-weapons, I own, which instead of wounding sheathe their points
in their own handles, but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be
real and deadly."</p>

<p id="id07720">"Jealousy indicates affection."</p>

<p id="id07721">"True; but I am not jealous."</p>

<p id="id07722">"He is."</p>

<p id="id07723">"Of whom?—of Debray?"</p>

<p id="id07724">"No, of you."</p>

<p id="id07725">"Of me? I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be
closed against me."</p>

<p id="id07726">"You are mistaken, my dear viscount."</p>

<p id="id07727">"Prove it to me."</p>

<p id="id07728">"Do you wish me to do so?"</p>

<p id="id07729">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07730">"Well, I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the<br/>

Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07731">"By whom are you charged?"</p>

<p id="id07732">"By the baron himself."</p>

<p id="id07733">"Oh," said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable. "You
surely will not do that, my dear count?"</p>

<p id="id07734">"Certainly I shall, Albert, as I have promised to do it."</p>

<p id="id07735">"Well," said Albert, with a sigh, "it seems you are determined to marry
me."</p>

<p id="id07736">"I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody, at all
events," said Monte Cristo. "But apropos of Debray, how is it that I
have not seen him lately at the baron's house?"</p>

<p id="id07737">"There has been a misunderstanding."</p>

<p id="id07738">"What, with the baroness?"</p>

<p id="id07739">"No, with the baron."</p>

<p id="id07740">"Has he perceived anything?"</p>

<p id="id07741">"Ah, that is a good joke!"</p>

<p id="id07742">"Do you think he suspects?" said Monte Cristo with charming artlessness.</p>

<p id="id07743">"Where have you come from, my dear count?" said Albert.</p>

<p id="id07744">"From Congo, if you will."</p>

<p id="id07745">"It must be farther off than even that."</p>

<p id="id07746">"But what do I know of your Parisian husbands?"</p>

<p id="id07747">"Oh, my dear count, husbands are pretty much the same everywhere; an
individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole
race."</p>

<p id="id07748">"But then, what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray?
They seemed to understand each other so well," said Monte Cristo with
renewed energy.</p>

<p id="id07749">"Ah, now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis, in
which I am not initiated. When M. Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of
the family, you can ask him that question." The carriage stopped. "Here
we are," said Monte Cristo; "it is only half-past ten o'clock, come in."</p>

<p id="id07750">"Certainly I will."</p>

<p id="id07751">"My carriage shall take you back."</p>

<p id="id07752">"No, thank you; I gave orders for my coupe to follow me."</p>

<p id="id07753">"There it is, then," said Monte Cristo, as he stepped out of the
carriage. They both went into the house; the drawing-room was lighted
up—they went in there. "You will make tea for us, Baptistin," said the
count. Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer, and in
two seconds reappeared, bringing on a waiter all that his master had
ordered, ready prepared, and appearing to have sprung from the ground,
like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales. "Really, my dear
count," said Morcerf, "what I admire in you is, not so much your riches,
for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself, nor is it
only your wit, for Beaumarchais might have possessed as much,—but it
is your manner of being served, without any questions, in a moment, in
a second; it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of
ringing, and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire
in constant readiness."</p>

<p id="id07754">"What you say is perhaps true; they know my habits. For instance, you
shall see; how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea-time?"</p>

<p id="id07755">"Ma foi, I should like to smoke."</p>

<p id="id07756">Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it once. In about the space of a
second a private door opened, and Ali appeared, bringing two chibouques
filled with excellent latakia. "It is quite wonderful," said Albert.</p>

<p id="id07757">"Oh no, it is as simple as possible," replied Monte Cristo. "Ali knows I
generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee; he has heard that I
ordered tea, and he also knows that I brought you home with me; when I
summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so, and as he
comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through
the medium of smoking, he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in
company, and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one—and now the
mystery is solved."</p>

<p id="id07758">"Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation, but
it is not the less true that you—Ah, but what do I hear?" and Morcerf
inclined his head towards the door, through which sounds seemed to issue
resembling those of a guitar.</p>

<p id="id07759">"Ma foi, my dear viscount, you are fated to hear music this evening; you
have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars' piano, to be attacked by
Haidee's guzla."</p>

<p id="id07760">"Haidee—what an adorable name! Are there, then, really women who bear
the name of Haidee anywhere but in Byron's poems?"</p>

<p id="id07761">"Certainly there are. Haidee is a very uncommon name in France, but is<br/>

common enough in Albania and Epirus; it is as if you said, for example,<br/>

Chastity, Modesty, Innocence,—it is a kind of baptismal name, as you<br/>

Parisians call it."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07762">"Oh, that is charming," said Albert, "how I should like to hear my
countrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness, Mademoiselle Silence,
Mademoiselle Christian Charity! Only think, then, if Mademoiselle
Danglars, instead of being called Claire-Marie-Eugenie, had been named
Mademoiselle Chastity-Modesty-Innocence Danglars; what a fine effect
that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage!"</p>

<p id="id07763">"Hush," said the count, "do not joke in so loud a tone; Haidee may hear
you, perhaps."</p>

<p id="id07764">"And you think she would be angry?"</p>

<p id="id07765">"No, certainly not," said the count with a haughty expression.</p>

<p id="id07766">"She is very amiable, then, is she not?" said Albert.</p>

<p id="id07767">"It is not to be called amiability, it is her duty; a slave does not
dictate to a master."</p>

<p id="id07768">"Come; you are joking yourself now. Are there any more slaves to be had
who bear this beautiful name?"</p>

<p id="id07769">"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p id="id07770">"Really, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people.<br/>

The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo! Why, it is a rank of itself in<br/>

France, and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that<br/>

must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id07771">"A hundred thousand francs! The poor girl originally possessed much
more than that; she was born to treasures in comparison with which those
recorded in the 'Thousand and One Nights' would seem but poverty."</p>

<p id="id07772">"She must be a princess then."</p>

<p id="id07773">"You are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too."</p>

<p id="id07774">"I thought so. But how did it happen that such a great princess became a
slave?"</p>

<p id="id07775">"How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster? The fortune
of war, my dear viscount,—the caprice of fortune; that is the way in
which these things are to be accounted for."</p>

<p id="id07776">"And is her name a secret?"</p>

<p id="id07777">"As regards the generality of mankind it is; but not for you, my dear
viscount, who are one of my most intimate friends, and on whose silence
I feel I may rely, if I consider it necessary to enjoin it—may I not do
so?"</p>

<p id="id07778">"Certainly; on my word of honor."</p>

<p id="id07779">"You know the history of the Pasha  of Yanina, do you not?"</p>

<p id="id07780">"Of Ali Tepelini? [*] Oh, yes; it was in his service that my father made
his fortune."</p>

<p id="id07781">"True, I had forgotten that."</p>

<p id="id07782" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     * Ali Pasha, "The Lion," was born at Tepelini, an Albanian
     village at the foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741. By
     diplomacy and success in arms he became almost supreme ruler
     of Albania, Epirus, and adjacent territory. Having aroused
     the enmity of the Sultan, he was proscribed and put to death
     by treachery in 1822, at the age of eighty.—Ed.</p>

<p id="id07783">"Well, what is Haidee to Ali Tepelini?"</p>

<p id="id07784">"Merely his daughter."</p>

<p id="id07785">"What? the daughter of Ali Pasha?"</p>

<p id="id07786">"Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki."</p>

<p id="id07787">"And your slave?"</p>

<p id="id07788">"Ma foi, yes."</p>

<p id="id07789">"But how did she become so?"</p>

<p id="id07790">"Why, simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day, as I
was passing through the market at Constantinople."</p>

<p id="id07791">"Wonderful! Really, my dear count, you seem to throw a sort of magic
influence over all in which you are concerned; when I listen to you,
existence no longer seems reality, but a waking dream. Now, I am perhaps
going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request, but"—</p>

<p id="id07792">"Say on."</p>

<p id="id07793">"But, since you go out with Haidee, and sometimes even take her to the
opera"—</p>

<p id="id07794">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id07795">"I think I may venture to ask you this favor."</p>

<p id="id07796">"You may venture to ask me anything."</p>

<p id="id07797">"Well then, my dear count, present me to your princess."</p>

<p id="id07798">"I will do so; but on two conditions."</p>

<p id="id07799">"I accept them at once."</p>

<p id="id07800">"The first is, that you will never tell any one that I have granted the
interview."</p>

<p id="id07801">"Very well," said Albert, extending his hand; "I swear I will not."</p>

<p id="id07802">"The second is, that you will not tell her that your father ever served
hers."</p>

<p id="id07803">"I give you my oath that I will not."</p>

<p id="id07804">"Enough, viscount; you will remember those two vows, will you not? But
I know you to be a man of honor." The count again struck the gong. Ali
reappeared. "Tell Haidee," said he, "that I will take coffee with her,
and give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my
friends to her." Ali bowed and left the room. "Now, understand me," said
the count, "no direct questions, my dear Morcerf; if you wish to know
anything, tell me, and I will ask her."</p>

<p id="id07805">"Agreed." Ali reappeared for the third time, and drew back the
tapestried hanging which concealed the door, to signify to his master
and Albert that they were at liberty to pass on. "Let us go in," said
Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id07806">Albert passed his hand through his hair, and curled his mustache, then,
having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance, followed the
count into the room, the latter having previously resumed his hat and
gloves. Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard, and the door was
kept by the three French attendants, commanded by Myrtho. Haidee was
awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments, which was the
drawing-room. Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation,
for it was the first time that any man, except Monte Cristo, had been
accorded an entrance into her presence. She was sitting on a sofa placed
in an angle of the room, with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern
fashion, and seemed to have made for herself, as it were, a kind of
nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped her. Near her was
the instrument on which she had just been playing; it was elegantly
fashioned, and worthy of its mistress. On perceiving Monte Cristo, she
arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself, expressive at
once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love. Monte
Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand, which she as usual
raised to her lips.</p>

<p id="id07807">Albert had proceeded no farther than the door, where he remained rooted
to the spot, being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing
beauty, beheld as it was for the first time, and of which an inhabitant
of more northern climes could form no adequate idea.</p>

<p id="id07808">"Whom do you bring?" asked the young girl in Romaic, of Monte Cristo;
"is it a friend, a brother, a simple acquaintance, or an enemy."</p>

<p id="id07809">"A friend," said Monte Cristo in the same language.</p>

<p id="id07810">"What is his name?"</p>

<p id="id07811">"Count Albert; it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the
banditti at Rome."</p>

<p id="id07812">"In what language would you like me to converse with him?"</p>

<p id="id07813">Monte Cristo turned to Albert. "Do you know modern Greek," asked he.</p>

<p id="id07814">"Alas, no," said Albert; "nor even ancient Greek, my dear count; never
had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself."</p>

<p id="id07815">"Then," said Haidee, proving by her remark that she had quite understood
Monte Cristo's question and Albert's answer, "then I will speak either
in French or Italian, if my lord so wills it."</p>

<p id="id07816">Monte Cristo reflected one instant. "You will speak in Italian," said
he. Then, turning towards Albert,—"It is a pity you do not understand
either ancient or modern Greek, both of which Haidee speaks so fluently;
the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian, which will
give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation." The
count made a sign to Haidee to address his visitor. "Sir," she said to
Morcerf, "you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master."
This was said in excellent Tuscan, and with that soft Roman accent which
makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of Homer. Then, turning
to Ali, she directed him to bring coffee and pipes, and when he had left
the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert
to approach nearer to her. Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats
towards a small table, on which were arranged music, drawings, and vases
of flowers. Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques; as to M.
Baptistin, this portion of the building was interdicted to him. Albert
refused the pipe which the Nubian offered him. "Oh, take it—take it,"
said the count; "Haidee is almost as civilized as a Parisian; the smell
of an Havana is disagreeable to her, but the tobacco of the East is a
most delicious perfume, you know."</p>

<p id="id07817">Ali left the room. The cups of coffee were all prepared, with the
addition of sugar, which had been brought for Albert. Monte Cristo and
Haidee took the beverage in the original Arabian manner, that is to
say, without sugar. Haidee took the porcelain cup in her little slender
fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness
of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes. At this
moment two women entered, bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet,
which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose.
"My dear host, and you, signora," said Albert, in Italian, "excuse my
apparent stupidity. I am quite bewildered, and it is natural that it
should be so. Here I am in the heart of Paris; but a moment ago I heard
the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the
lemonade-sellers, and now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to
the East; not such as I have seen it, but such as my dreams have painted
it. Oh, signora, if I could but speak Greek, your conversation, added
to the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evening of such
delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget."</p>

<p id="id07818">"I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,"
said Haidee quietly; "and if you like what is Eastern, I will do my best
to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here."</p>

<p id="id07819">"On what subject shall I converse with her?" said Albert, in a low tone
to Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id07820">"Just what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful
reminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of Rome, Naples, or
Florence."</p>

<p id="id07821">"Oh," said Albert, "it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if
one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian; let me speak to
her of the East."</p>

<p id="id07822">"Do so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be the
most agreeable to her taste." Albert turned towards Haidee. "At what age
did you leave Greece, signora?" asked he.</p>

<p id="id07823">"I left it when I was but five years old," replied Haidee.</p>

<p id="id07824">"And have you any recollection of your country?"</p>

<p id="id07825">"When I shut my eyes and think, I seem to see it all again. The mind can
see as well as the body. The body forgets sometimes—but the mind never
forgets."</p>

<p id="id07826">"And how far back into the past do your recollections extend?"</p>

<p id="id07827">"I could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki, which
means royal," said the young girl, tossing her head proudly, "took me by
the hand, and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed, we
went out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for the prisoners,
saying, 'He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.' Then when our
purse was full we returned to the palace, and without saying a word to
my father, we sent it to the convent, where it was divided amongst the
prisoners."</p>

<p id="id07828">"And how old were you at that time?"</p>

<p id="id07829">"I was three years old," said Haidee.</p>

<p id="id07830">"Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when
you were three years old?" said Albert.</p>

<p id="id07831">"Everything."</p>

<p id="id07832">"Count," said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo, "do allow
the signora to tell me something of her history. You prohibited my
mentioning my father's name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him
of her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea
how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful
lips." Monte Cristo turned to Haidee, and with an expression of
countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to
his words, he said in Greek,—"Tell us the fate of your father; but
neither the name of the traitor nor the treason." Haidee sighed deeply,
and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow.</p>

<p id="id07833">"What are you saying to her?" said Morcerf in an undertone.</p>

<p id="id07834">"I again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not
conceal anything from you."</p>

<p id="id07835">"Then," said Albert, "this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners
was your first remembrance; what is the next?"</p>

<p id="id07836">"Oh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade
of some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters of which
the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror. Under the oldest and
thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my father; my mother
was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by playing with his
long white beard which descended to his girdle, or with the diamond-hilt
of the scimitar attached to his girdle. Then from time to time there
came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention,
but which he always answered in the same tone of voice, either 'Kill,'
or 'Pardon.'"</p>

<p id="id07837">"It is very strange," said Albert, "to hear such words proceed from the
mouth of any one but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly
to be saying to one's self, 'This is no fiction, it is all reality,' in
order to believe it. And how does France appear in your eyes, accustomed
as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?"</p>

<p id="id07838">"I think it is a fine country," said Haidee, "but I see France as it
really is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my own
country, which I can only judge of from the impression produced on my
childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which is
luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or
joyous."</p>

<p id="id07839">"So young," said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Count's command
that he should ask no questions of the slave herself, "is it possible
that you can have known what suffering is except by name?"</p>

<p id="id07840">Haidee turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same
time some imperceptible sign, murmured,—"Go on."</p>

<p id="id07841">"Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our
early childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just
described to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest
sadness."</p>

<p id="id07842">"Speak, speak, signora," said Albert, "I am listening with the most
intense delight and interest to all you say."</p>

<p id="id07843">Haidee answered his remark with a melancholy smile. "You wish me, then,
to relate the history of my past sorrows?" said she.</p>

<p id="id07844">"I beg you to do so," replied Albert.</p>

<p id="id07845">"Well, I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened
by my mother. We were in the palace of Yanina; she snatched me from
the cushions on which I was sleeping, and on opening my eyes I saw hers
filled with tears. She took me away without speaking. When I saw her
weeping I began to cry too. 'Hush, child!' said she. At other times in
spite of maternal endearments or threats, I had with a child's caprice
been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as
much as I felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an intonation
of such extreme terror in my mother's voice when she enjoined me to
silence, that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given. She bore
me rapidly away.</p>
