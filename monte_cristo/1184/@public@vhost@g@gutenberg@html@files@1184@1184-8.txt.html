  <body><p id="id02296">"But why into five parts?" asked Caderousse; "you only mentioned four
persons."</p>

<p id="id02297">"Because the fifth is dead, as I hear. The fifth sharer in Edmond's
bequest, was his own father."</p>

<p id="id02298">"Too true, too true!" ejaculated Caderousse, almost suffocated by the
contending passions which assailed him, "the poor old man did die."</p>

<p id="id02299">"I learned so much at Marseilles," replied the abbe, making a strong
effort to appear indifferent; "but from the length of time that has
elapsed since the death of the elder Dantes, I was unable to obtain any
particulars of his end. Can you enlighten me on that point?"</p>

<p id="id02300">"I do not know who could if I could not," said Caderousse. "Why, I lived
almost on the same floor with the poor old man. Ah, yes, about a year
after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died."</p>

<p id="id02301">"Of what did he die?"</p>

<p id="id02302">"Why, the doctors called his complaint gastro-enteritis, I believe;
his acquaintances say he died of grief; but I, who saw him in his dying
moments, I say he died of"—Caderousse paused.</p>

<p id="id02303">"Of what?" asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.</p>

<p id="id02304">"Why, of downright starvation."</p>

<p id="id02305">"Starvation!" exclaimed the abbe, springing from his seat. "Why, the
vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that. The very
dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying
hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a Christian,
should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who
call themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief. Oh, it is
impossible—utterly impossible!"</p>

<p id="id02306">"What I have said, I have said," answered Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02307">"And you are a fool for having said anything about it," said a voice
from the top of the stairs. "Why should you meddle with what does not
concern you?"</p>

<p id="id02308">The two men turned quickly, and saw the sickly countenance of La
Carconte peering between the baluster rails; attracted by the sound of
voices, she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs, and, seated
on the lower step, head on knees, she had listened to the foregoing
conversation. "Mind your own business, wife," replied Caderousse
sharply. "This gentleman asks me for information, which common
politeness will not permit me to refuse."</p>

<p id="id02309">"Politeness, you simpleton!" retorted La Carconte. "What have you to
do with politeness, I should like to know? Better study a little common
prudence. How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to
extract all he can from you?"</p>

<p id="id02310">"I pledge you my word, madam," said the abbe, "that my intentions are
good; and that you husband can incur no risk, provided he answers me
candidly."</p>

<p id="id02311">"Ah, that's all very fine," retorted the woman. "Nothing is easier than
to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when
poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to
tell all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly
forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold
trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the
unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions
come."</p>

<p id="id02312">"Nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of
you. Whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my
instrumentality, that I solemnly promise you."</p>

<p id="id02313">La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again
drop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two
speakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to
hear every word they uttered. Again the abbe had been obliged to swallow
a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower
him. When he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, "It appears,
then, that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken
by every one. Surely, had not such been the case, he would not have
perished by so dreadful a death."</p>

<p id="id02314">"Why, he was not altogether forsaken," continued Caderousse, "for
Mercedes the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him;
but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for
Fernand—the very person," added Caderousse with a bitter smile,
"that you named just now as being one of Dantes' faithful and attached
friends."</p>

<p id="id02315">"And was he not so?" asked the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02316">"Gaspard, Gaspard!" murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs,
"mind what you are saying!" Caderousse made no reply to these words,
though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption, but,
addressing the abbe, said, "Can a man be faithful to another whose wife
he covets and desires for himself? But Dantes was so honorable and
true in his own nature, that he believed everybody's professions of
friendship. Poor Edmond, he was cruelly deceived; but it was fortunate
that he never knew, or he might have found it more difficult, when on
his deathbed, to pardon his enemies. And, whatever people may say,"
continued Caderousse, in his native language, which was not altogether
devoid of rude poetry, "I cannot help being more frightened at the idea
of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living."</p>

<p id="id02317">"Imbecile!" exclaimed La Carconte.</p>

<p id="id02318">"Do you, then, know in what manner Fernand injured Dantes?" inquired the
abbe of Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02319">"Do I? No one better."</p>

<p id="id02320">"Speak out then, say what it was!"</p>

<p id="id02321">"Gaspard!" cried La Carconte, "do as you will; you are master—but if
you take my advice you'll hold your tongue."</p>

<p id="id02322">"Well, wife," replied Caderousse, "I don't know but what you're right!"</p>

<p id="id02323">"So you will say nothing?" asked the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02324">"Why, what good would it do?" asked Caderousse. "If the poor lad were
living, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which
were his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should not
hesitate. But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing
to do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with
him."</p>

<p id="id02325">"You prefer, then," said the abbe, "that I should bestow on men you say
are false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful friendship?"</p>

<p id="id02326">"That is true enough," returned Caderousse. "You say truly, the gift
of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars;
besides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of water in the
ocean."</p>

<p id="id02327">"Remember," chimed in La Carconte, "those two could crush you at a
single blow!"</p>

<p id="id02328">"How so?" inquired the abbe. "Are these persons, then, so rich and
powerful?"</p>

<p id="id02329">"Do you not know their history?"</p>

<p id="id02330">"I do not. Pray relate it to me!" Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few
moments, then said, "No, truly, it would take up too much time."</p>

<p id="id02331">"Well, my good friend," returned the abbe, in a tone that indicated
utter indifference on his part, "you are at liberty, either to speak or
be silent, just as you please; for my own part, I respect your scruples
and admire your sentiments; so let the matter end. I shall do my duty
as conscientiously as I can, and fulfil my promise to the dying man. My
first business will be to dispose of this diamond." So saying, the abbe
again draw the small box from his pocket, opened it, and contrived to
hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed
before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02332">"Wife, wife!" cried he in a hoarse voice, "come here!"</p>

<p id="id02333">"Diamond!" exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber
with a tolerably firm step; "what diamond are you talking about?"</p>

<p id="id02334">"Why, did you not hear all we said?" inquired Caderousse. "It is a
beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantes, to be sold, and the money
divided between his father, Mercedes, his betrothed bride, Fernand,
Danglars, and myself. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand
francs."</p>

<p id="id02335">"Oh, what a magnificent jewel!" cried the astonished woman.</p>

<p id="id02336">"The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does
it not?" asked Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02337">"It does," replied the abbe; "with the addition of an equal division
of that part intended for the elder Dantes, which I believe myself at
liberty to divide equally with the four survivors."</p>

<p id="id02338">"And why among us four?" inquired Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02339">"As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him."</p>

<p id="id02340">"I don't call those friends who betray and ruin you," murmured the wife
in her turn, in a low, muttering voice.</p>

<p id="id02341">"Of course not!" rejoined Caderousse quickly; "no more do I, and that
was what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said I looked
upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps
crime."</p>

<p id="id02342">"Remember," answered the abbe calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its
case in the pocket of his cassock, "it is your fault, not mine, that I
do so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both
Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond's last
wishes." The agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of
perspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abbe rise from
his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse
were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his
wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.</p>

<p id="id02343">"There, you see, wife," said the former, "this splendid diamond might
all be ours, if we chose!"</p>

<p id="id02344">"Do you believe it?"</p>

<p id="id02345">"Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!"</p>

<p id="id02346">"Well," replied La Carconte, "do as you like. For my part, I wash my
hands of the affair." So saying, she once more climbed the staircase
leading to her chamber, her body convulsed with chills, and her teeth
rattling in her head, in spite of the intense heat of the weather.
Arrived at the top stair, she turned round, and called out, in a warning
tone, to her husband, "Gaspard, consider well what you are about to do!"</p>

<p id="id02347">"I have both reflected and decided," answered he. La Carconte then
entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy,
uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her arm-chair, into which she
fell as though exhausted.</p>

<p id="id02348">"Well," asked the abbe, as he returned to the apartment below, "what
have you made up your mind to do?"</p>

<p id="id02349">"To tell you all I know," was the reply.</p>

<p id="id02350">"I certainly think you act wisely in so doing," said the priest. "Not
because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to
conceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could
distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so
much the better, that is all."</p>

<p id="id02351">"I hope it may be so," replied Caderousse, his face flushed with
cupidity.</p>

<p id="id02352">"I am all attention," said the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02353">"Stop a minute," answered Caderousse; "we might be interrupted in the
most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as
well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves."
With these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and,
by way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was
accustomed to do at night. During this time the abbe had chosen his
place for listening at his ease. He removed his seat into a corner of
the room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the light
would be fully thrown on the narrator; then, with head bent down and
hands clasped, or rather clinched together, he prepared to give his
whole attention to Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool,
exactly opposite to him.</p>

<p id="id02354">"Remember, this is no affair of mine," said the trembling voice of La
Carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the
scene that was enacting below.</p>

<p id="id02355">"Enough, enough!" replied Caderousse; "say no more about it; I will take
all the consequences upon myself." And he began his story.</p>

<h3 id="id02356" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 27. The Story.</h3>

<p id="id02357">"First, sir," said Caderousse, "you must make me a promise."</p>

<p id="id02358">"What is that?" inquired the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02359">"Why, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you, that
you will never let any one know that it was I who supplied them; for the
persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if they
only laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to pieces like
glass."</p>

<p id="id02360">"Make yourself easy, my friend," replied the abbe. "I am a priest, and
confessions die in my breast. Recollect, our only desire is to carry
out, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. Speak, then,
without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; I
do not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to speak;
besides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to God, and
not to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I have
only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man." This positive
assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage.</p>

<p id="id02361">"Well, then, under these circumstances," said Caderousse, "I will, I
even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor
Edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable."</p>

<p id="id02362">"Begin with his father, if you please." said the abbe; "Edmond talked to
me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love."</p>

<p id="id02363">"The history is a sad one, sir," said Caderousse, shaking his head;
"perhaps you know all the earlier part of it?"</p>

<p id="id02364">"Yes." answered the abbe; "Edmond related to me everything until the
moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id02365">"At La Reserve! Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment."</p>

<p id="id02366">"Was it not his betrothal feast?"</p>

<p id="id02367">"It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending;
a police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dantes was
arrested."</p>

<p id="id02368">"Yes, and up to this point I know all," said the priest. "Dantes himself
only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never beheld again
the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of any one of
them."</p>

<p id="id02369">"Well, when Dantes was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the
particulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his
home, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up
and down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all,
for I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for
myself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the poor
father gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my heart
as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast. The next day
Mercedes came to implore the protection of M. de Villefort; she did not
obtain it, however, and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so
miserable and heart-broken, having passed a sleepless night, and not
touched food since the previous day, she wished him to go with her that
she might take care of him; but the old man would not consent. 'No,' was
the old man's reply, 'I will not leave this house, for my poor dear boy
loves me better than anything in the world; and if he gets out of prison
he will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if I
did not wait here for him?' I heard all this from the window, for I was
anxious that Mercedes should persuade the old man to accompany her, for
his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment's
repose."</p>

<p id="id02370">"But did you not go up-stairs and try to console the poor old man?"
asked the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02371">"Ah, sir," replied Caderousse, "we cannot console those who will not
be consoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not why, but he
seemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his sobs, and I
could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his door
he was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you, sir,
all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was
more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter, and
hate the Jesuits, said then to myself, 'It is really well, and I am very
glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt such
excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory or
heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at once,
for I could not bear it.'"</p>

<p id="id02372">"Poor father!" murmured the priest.</p>

<p id="id02373">"From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M.
Morrel and Mercedes came to see him, but his door was closed; and,
although I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer.
One day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Mercedes, and the
poor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to console
him, he said to her,—'Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead; and
instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite happy,
for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.' However well
disposed a person may be, why you see we leave off after a time seeing
persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and so at last
old Dantes was left all to himself, and I only saw from time to time
strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried
to hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he sold by
degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the poor old
fellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters' rent, and
they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week, which was
granted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into my apartment
when he left his. For the first three days I heard him walking about as
usual, but, on the fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to
him at all risks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole,
and saw him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and
told M. Morrel and then ran on to Mercedes. They both came immediately,
M. Morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation
of the bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I
never shall forget the old man's smile at this prescription. From that
time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more;
the doctor had put him on a diet." The abbe uttered a kind of groan.
"The story interests you, does it not, sir?" inquired Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02374">"Yes," replied the abbe, "it is very affecting."</p>

<p id="id02375">"Mercedes came again, and she found him so altered that she was even
more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M.
Morrel's wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against his
consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were actually
frightened. Mercedes remained, therefore, by his bedside, and M. Morrel
went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on
the chimney-piece. But availing himself of the doctor's order, the old
man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair
and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery,
and saying to Mercedes, 'If you ever see my Edmond again, tell him I die
blessing him.'" The abbe rose from his chair, made two turns round the
chamber, and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat. "And
you believe he died"—</p>

<p id="id02376">"Of hunger, sir, of hunger," said Caderousse. "I am as certain of it as
that we two are Christians."</p>

<p id="id02377">The abbe, with a shaking hand, seized a glass of water that was standing
by him half-full, swallowed it at one gulp, and then resumed his seat,
with red eyes and pale cheeks. "This was, indeed, a horrid event." said
he in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p id="id02378">"The more so, sir, as it was men's and not God's doing."</p>

<p id="id02379">"Tell me of those men," said the abbe, "and remember too," he added in
an almost menacing tone, "you have promised to tell me everything. Tell
me, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and
the father with famine?"</p>

<p id="id02380">"Two men jealous of him, sir; one from love, and the other from
ambition,—Fernand and Danglars."</p>

<p id="id02381">"How was this jealousy manifested? Speak on."</p>

<p id="id02382">"They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent."</p>

<p id="id02383">"Which of the two denounced him? Which was the real delinquent?"</p>

<p id="id02384">"Both, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post."</p>

<p id="id02385">"And where was this letter written?"</p>

<p id="id02386">"At La Reserve, the day before the betrothal feast."</p>

<p id="id02387">"'Twas so, then—'twas so, then," murmured the abbe. "Oh, Faria, Faria,
how well did you judge men and things!"</p>

<p id="id02388">"What did you please to say, sir?" asked Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02389">"Nothing, nothing," replied the priest; "go on."</p>

<p id="id02390">"It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand, that his
writing might not be recognized, and Fernand who put it in the post."</p>

<p id="id02391">"But," exclaimed the abbe suddenly, "you were there yourself."</p>

<p id="id02392">"I!" said Caderousse, astonished; "who told you I was there?"</p>

<p id="id02393">The abbe saw he had overshot the mark, and he added quickly,—"No one;
but in order to have known everything so well, you must have been an
eye-witness."</p>

<p id="id02394">"True, true!" said Caderousse in a choking voice, "I was there."</p>

<p id="id02395">"And did you not remonstrate against such infamy?" asked the abbe; "if
not, you were an accomplice."</p>

<p id="id02396">"Sir," replied Caderousse, "they had made me drink to such an
excess that I nearly lost all perception. I had only an indistinct
understanding of what was passing around me. I said all that a man in
such a state could say; but they both assured me that it was a jest they
were carrying on, and perfectly harmless."</p>

<p id="id02397">"Next day—next day, sir, you must have seen plain enough what they had
been doing, yet you said nothing, though you were present when Dantes
was arrested."</p>

<p id="id02398">"Yes, sir, I was there, and very anxious to speak; but Danglars
restrained me. 'If he should really be guilty,' said he, 'and did really
put in to the Island of Elba; if he is really charged with a letter for
the Bonapartist committee at Paris, and if they find this letter upon
him, those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices.' I
confess I had my fears, in the state in which politics then were, and I
held my tongue. It was cowardly, I confess, but it was not criminal."</p>

<p id="id02399">"I understand—you allowed matters to take their course, that was all."</p>

<p id="id02400">"Yes, sir," answered Caderousse; "and remorse preys on me night and day.
I often ask pardon of God, I swear to you, because this action, the only
one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life, is
no doubt the cause of my abject condition. I am expiating a moment of
selfishness, and so I always say to La Carconte, when she complains,
'Hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of God.'" And Caderousse bowed
his head with every sign of real repentance.</p>

<p id="id02401">"Well, sir," said the abbe, "you have spoken unreservedly; and thus to
accuse yourself is to deserve pardon."</p>

<p id="id02402">"Unfortunately, Edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me."</p>

<p id="id02403">"He did not know," said the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02404">"But he knows it all now," interrupted Caderousse; "they say the dead
know everything." There was a brief silence; the abbe rose and paced up
and down pensively, and then resumed his seat. "You have two or three
times mentioned a M. Morrel," he said; "who was he?"</p>

<p id="id02405">"The owner of the Pharaon and patron of Dantes."</p>

<p id="id02406">"And what part did he play in this sad drama?" inquired the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02407">"The part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. Twenty
times he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote,
implored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second
restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told
you, he came to see Dantes' father, and offered to receive him in his
own house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already
said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old
man's debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmond's father died, as
he had lived, without doing harm to any one. I have the purse still by
me—a large one, made of red silk."</p>

<p id="id02408">"And," asked the abbe, "is M. Morrel still alive?"</p>

<p id="id02409">"Yes," replied Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02410">"In that case," replied the abbe, "he should be rich, happy."</p>

<p id="id02411">Caderousse smiled bitterly. "Yes, happy as myself," said he.</p>

<p id="id02412">"What! M. Morrel unhappy?" exclaimed the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02413">"He is reduced almost to the last extremity—nay, he is almost at the
point of dishonor."</p>

<p id="id02414">"How?"</p>

<p id="id02415">"Yes," continued Caderousse, "so it is; after five and twenty years
of labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of
Marseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two
years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his
only hope now is in that very Pharaon which poor Dantes commanded, and
which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo.
If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man."</p>

<p id="id02416">"And has the unfortunate man wife or children?" inquired the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02417">"Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel;
he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose
family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he
has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose,
all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were
alone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an
end."</p>

<p id="id02418">"Horrible!" ejaculated the priest.</p>

<p id="id02419">"And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir," added Caderousse. "You
see, I, who never did a bad action but that I have told you of—am in
destitution, with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes, and
I unable to do anything in the world for her; I shall die of hunger, as
old Dantes did, while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth."</p>

<p id="id02420">"How is that?"</p>

<p id="id02421">"Because their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest men
have been reduced to misery."</p>

<p id="id02422">"What has become of Danglars, the instigator, and therefore the most
guilty?"</p>

<p id="id02423">"What has become of him? Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on the
recommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier
into a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the
commissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that
money he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his capital;
and, having first married his banker's daughter, who left him a widower,
he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne, daughter of
M. de Servieux, the king's chamberlain, who is in high favor at court.
He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron, and now he is the
Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue de Mont-Blanc, with ten
horses in his stables, six footmen in his ante-chamber, and I know not
how many millions in his strongbox."</p>

<p id="id02424">"Ah!" said the abbe, in a peculiar tone, "he is happy."</p>

<p id="id02425">"Happy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the secret
known but to one's self and the walls—walls have ears but no tongue;
but if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy."</p>

<p id="id02426">"And Fernand?"</p>

<p id="id02427">"Fernand? Why, much the same story."</p>

<p id="id02428">"But how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or
resources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me."</p>

<p id="id02429">"And it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life some
strange secret that no one knows."</p>

<p id="id02430">"But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or
high position?"</p>

<p id="id02431">"Both, sir—he has both fortune and position—both."</p>

<p id="id02432">"This must be impossible!"</p>

<p id="id02433">"It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days before
the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons left him
quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy
was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was
older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent
to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active troop, went to the
frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night
after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on
a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general
was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him;
Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general.
Fernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on
the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to
France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of
the general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was
a captain in 1823, during the Spanish war—that is to say, at the time
when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and
being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen,
found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the
support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received
promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths
known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held
by the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief
campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and
received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of
Honor."</p>

<p id="id02434">"Destiny! destiny!" murmured the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02435">"Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended,
Fernand's career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to
endure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had
begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it
was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government,
without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to
volunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve
in Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll. Some time after,
it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had
entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general.
Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed
the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he
returned to France, when he was gazetted lieutenant-general."</p>

<p id="id02436">"So that now?"—inquired the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02437">"So that now," continued Caderousse, "he owns a magnificent house—No.
27, Rue du Helder, Paris." The abbe opened his mouth, hesitated for
a moment, then, making an effort at self-control, he said, "And
Mercedes—they tell me that she has disappeared?"</p>

<p id="id02438">"Disappeared," said Caderousse, "yes, as the sun disappears, to rise the
next day with still more splendor."</p>

<p id="id02439">"Has she made a fortune also?" inquired the abbe, with an ironical
smile.</p>

<p id="id02440">"Mercedes is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,"
replied Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02441">"Go on," said the abbe; "it seems as if I were listening to the story of
a dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me
seems less astonishing than it otherwise might."</p>

<p id="id02442">"Mercedes was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived
her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de
Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dantes. In the midst of her
despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of
Fernand—of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded
as her brother. Fernand went, and Mercedes remained alone. Three months
passed and still she wept—no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand, no
companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair. One
evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads
leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home
more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned
anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform
of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her. It was not the one she wished for
most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her.
Mercedes seized Fernand's hands with a transport which he took for love,
but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing
at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow. And then, it must
be confessed, Fernand had never been hated—he was only not precisely
loved. Another possessed all Mercedes' heart; that other was absent, had
disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought Mercedes burst into
a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which
she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another,
came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old Dantes
incessantly said to her, 'Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would
return to us.' The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived,
Mercedes, perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would
have been there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when
he learned of the old man's death he returned. He was now a lieutenant.
At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercedes; at the
second he reminded her that he loved her. Mercedes begged for six months
more in which to await and mourn for Edmond."</p>

<p id="id02443">"So that," said the abbe, with a bitter smile, "that makes eighteen
months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?" Then he
murmured the words of the English poet, "'Frailty, thy name is woman.'"</p>

<p id="id02444">"Six months afterwards," continued Caderousse, "the marriage took place
in the church of Accoules."</p>

<p id="id02445">"The very church in which she was to have married Edmond," murmured the
priest; "there was only a change of bride-grooms."</p>

<p id="id02446">"Well, Mercedes was married," proceeded Caderousse; "but although in the
eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed
La Reserve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had been
celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she
looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not more at
his ease—for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmond's
return—Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to depart
himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with
the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id02447">"Did you ever see Mercedes again?" inquired the priest.</p>

<p id="id02448">"Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her;
she was attending to the education of her son." The abbe started. "Her
son?" said he.</p>

<p id="id02449">"Yes," replied Caderousse, "little Albert."</p>

<p id="id02450">"But, then, to be able to instruct her child," continued the abbe, "she
must have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that
she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated."</p>

<p id="id02451">"Oh," replied Caderousse, "did he know so little of his lovely
betrothed? Mercedes might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to
be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernand's
fortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing
fortune. She learned drawing, music—everything. Besides, I believe,
between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she
might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the
weight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured," continued
Caderousse; "no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her; she is
rich, a countess, and yet"—Caderousse paused.</p>

<p id="id02452">"And yet what?" asked the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02453">"Yet, I am sure, she is not happy," said Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id02454">"What makes you believe this?"</p>

<p id="id02455">"Why, when I found myself utterly destitute, I thought my old friends
would, perhaps, assist me. So I went to Danglars, who would not even
receive me. I called on Fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his
valet-de-chambre."</p>

<p id="id02456">"Then you did not see either of them?"</p>

<p id="id02457">"No, but Madame de Morcerf saw me."</p>

<p id="id02458">"How was that?"</p>

<p id="id02459">"As I went away a purse fell at my feet—it contained five and twenty
louis; I raised my head quickly, and saw Mercedes, who at once shut the
blind."</p>

<p id="id02460">"And M. de Villefort?" asked the abbe.</p>

<p id="id02461">"Oh, he never was a friend of mine, I did not know him, and I had
nothing to ask of him."</p>

<p id="id02462">"Do you not know what became of him, and the share he had in Edmond's
misfortunes?"</p>

<p id="id02463">"No; I only know that some time after Edmond's arrest, he married
Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran, and soon after left Marseilles; no doubt
he has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars,
as high in station as Fernand. I only, as you see, have remained poor,
wretched, and forgotten."</p>

<p id="id02464">"You are mistaken, my friend," replied the abbe; "God may seem sometimes
to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there always comes
a moment when he remembers—and behold—a proof!" As he spoke, the
abbe took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it to Caderousse,
said,—"Here, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours."</p>

<p id="id02465">"What, for me only?" cried Caderousse, "ah, sir, do not jest with me!"</p>

<p id="id02466">"This diamond was to have been shared among his friends. Edmond had one
friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and
sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that
this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness."</p>

<p id="id02467">"Oh, sir," said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the
other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,—"Oh, sir, do
not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man."</p>

<p id="id02468">"I know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of
such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange—"</p>

<p id="id02469">Caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand. The abbe smiled.
"In exchange," he continued, "give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel
left on old Dantes' chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in
your hands." Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large
oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbe a long purse of faded red
silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The
abbe took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.</p>

<p id="id02470">"Oh, you are a man of God, sir," cried Caderousse; "for no one knew that<br/>

Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02471">"Which," said the abbe to himself, "you would have done." The abbe
rose, took his hat and gloves. "Well," he said, "all you have told me is
perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular."</p>

<p id="id02472">"See, sir," replied Caderousse, "in this corner is a crucifix in holy
wood—here on this shelf is my wife's testament; open this book, and I
will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix. I will swear to you by
my soul's salvation, my faith as a Christian, I have told everything to
you as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear
of God at the day of the last judgment!"</p>

<p id="id02473">"'Tis well," said the abbe, convinced by his manner and tone that
Caderousse spoke the truth. "'Tis well, and may this money profit you!
Adieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other."
The abbe with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of
Caderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his horse, once
more saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud farewells, and
then returned by the road he had travelled in coming. When Caderousse
turned around, he saw behind him La Carconte, paler and trembling more
than ever. "Is, then, all that I have heard really true?" she inquired.</p>

<p id="id02474">"What? That he has given the diamond to us only?" inquired Caderousse,
half bewildered with joy; "yes, nothing more true! See, here it is." The
woman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a gloomy voice, "Suppose
it's false?" Caderousse started and turned pale. "False!" he muttered.
"False! Why should that man give me a false diamond?"</p>

<p id="id02475">"To get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!"</p>

<p id="id02476">Caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an
idea. "Oh!" he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red
handkerchief tied round his head, "we will soon find out."</p>

<p id="id02477">"In what way?"</p>

<p id="id02478">"Why, the fair is on at Beaucaire, there are always jewellers from Paris
there, and I will show it to them. Look after the house, wife, and I
shall be back in two hours," and Caderousse left the house in haste,
and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had
taken. "Fifty thousand francs!" muttered La Carconte when left alone;
"it is a large sum of money, but it is not a fortune."</p>

<h3 id="id02479" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 28. The Prison Register.</h3>

<p id="id02480">The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken
place on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about
thirty or two and thirty, dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen
trousers, and a white waistcoat, having the appearance and accent of
an Englishman, presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles. "Sir,"
said he, "I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French, of Rome. We
are, and have been these ten years, connected with the house of Morrel
&amp; Son, of Marseilles. We have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts
loaned on their securities, and we are a little uneasy at reports that
have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin. I have come,
therefore, express from Rome, to ask you for information."</p>

<p id="id02481">"Sir," replied the mayor. "I know very well that during the last four or
five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M. Morrel. He has lost four
or five vessels, and suffered by three or four bankruptcies; but it
is not for me, although I am a creditor myself to the amount of
ten thousand francs, to give any information as to the state of his
finances. Ask of me, as mayor, what is my opinion of M. Morrel, and I
shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree, and who has
up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality.
This is all I can say, sir; if you wish to learn more, address yourself
to M. de Boville, the inspector of prisons, No. 15, Rue de Nouailles;
he has, I believe, two hundred thousand francs in Morrel's hands, and if
there be any grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount than
mine, you will most probably find him better informed than myself."</p>

<p id="id02482">The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy, made his bow
and went away, proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards
the street mentioned. M. de Boville was in his private room, and the
Englishman, on perceiving him, made a gesture of surprise, which seemed
to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence.
As to M. de Boville, he was in such a state of despair, that it was
evident all the faculties of his mind, absorbed in the thought which
occupied him at the moment, did not allow either his memory or his
imagination to stray to the past. The Englishman, with the coolness of
his nation, addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which
he had accosted the mayor of Marseilles. "Oh, sir," exclaimed M. de
Boville, "your fears are unfortunately but too well founded, and you see
before you a man in despair. I had two hundred thousand francs placed
in the hands of Morrel &amp; Son; these two hundred thousand francs were the
dowry of my daughter, who was to be married in a fortnight, and these
two hundred thousand francs were payable, half on the 15th of this
month, and the other half on the 15th of next month. I had informed M.
Morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually, and he has been
here within the last half-hour to tell me that if his ship, the Pharaon,
did not come into port on the 15th, he would be wholly unable to make
this payment."</p>

<p id="id02483">"But," said the Englishman, "this looks very much like a suspension of
payment."</p>

<p id="id02484">"It looks more like bankruptcy!" exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly.</p>

<p id="id02485">The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said,—"From which
it would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with considerable
apprehension?"</p>

<p id="id02486">"To tell you the truth, I consider it lost."</p>

<p id="id02487">"Well, then, I will buy it of you!"</p>

<p id="id02488">"You?"</p>

<p id="id02489">"Yes, I!"</p>

<p id="id02490">"But at a tremendous discount, of course?"</p>

<p id="id02491">"No, for two hundred thousand francs. Our house," added the Englishman
with a laugh, "does not do things in that way."</p>

<p id="id02492">"And you will pay"—</p>

<p id="id02493">"Ready money." And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of
bank-notes, which might have been twice the sum M. de Boville feared
to lose. A ray of joy passed across M. de Boville's countenance, yet
he made an effort at self-control, and said,—"Sir, I ought to tell
you that, in all probability, you will not realize six per cent of this
sum."</p>

<p id="id02494">"That's no affair of mine," replied the Englishman, "that is the affair
of the house of Thomson &amp; French, in whose name I act. They have,
perhaps, some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm.
But all I know, sir, is, that I am ready to hand you over this sum in
exchange for your assignment of the debt. I only ask a brokerage."</p>

<p id="id02495">"Of course, that is perfectly just," cried M. de Boville. "The
commission is usually one and a half; will you have two—three—five per
cent, or even more? Whatever you say."</p>

<p id="id02496">"Sir," replied the Englishman, laughing, "I am like my house, and do not
do such things—no, the commission I ask is quite different."</p>

<p id="id02497">"Name it, sir, I beg."</p>

<p id="id02498">"You are the inspector of prisons?"</p>

<p id="id02499">"I have been so these fourteen years."</p>

<p id="id02500">"You keep the registers of entries and departures?"</p>

<p id="id02501">"I do."</p>

<p id="id02502">"To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners?"</p>

<p id="id02503">"There are special reports on every prisoner."</p>

<p id="id02504">"Well, sir, I was educated at home by a poor devil of an abbe, who
disappeared suddenly. I have since learned that he was confined in the
Chateau d'If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his death."</p>

<p id="id02505">"What was his name?"</p>

<p id="id02506">"The Abbe Faria."</p>

<p id="id02507">"Oh, I recollect him perfectly," cried M. de Boville; "he was crazy."</p>

<p id="id02508">"So they said."</p>

<p id="id02509">"Oh, he was, decidedly."</p>

<p id="id02510">"Very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?"</p>

<p id="id02511">"He pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums to
the government if they would liberate him."</p>

<p id="id02512">"Poor devil!—and he is dead?"</p>

<p id="id02513">"Yes, sir, five or six months ago—last February."</p>

<p id="id02514">"You have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well."</p>

<p id="id02515">"I recollect this, because the poor devil's death was accompanied by a
singular incident."</p>

<p id="id02516">"May I ask what that was?" said the Englishman with an expression
of curiosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at
discovering in his phlegmatic countenance.</p>

<p id="id02517">"Oh dear, yes, sir; the abbe's dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant
from that of one of Bonaparte's emissaries,—one of those who had
contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815,—a very
resolute and very dangerous man."</p>

<p id="id02518">"Indeed!" said the Englishman.</p>

<p id="id02519">"Yes," replied M. de Boville; "I myself had occasion to see this man
in 1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of
soldiers. That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget
his countenance!" The Englishman smiled imperceptibly.</p>

<p id="id02520">"And you say, sir," he interposed, "that the two dungeons"—</p>

<p id="id02521">"Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this<br/>

Edmond Dantes"—<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02522">"This dangerous man's name was"—</p>

<p id="id02523">"Edmond Dantes. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantes had procured
tools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners
held communication with one another."</p>

<p id="id02524">"This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?"</p>

<p id="id02525">"No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbe Faria had an
attack of catalepsy, and died."</p>

<p id="id02526">"That must have cut short the projects of escape."</p>

<p id="id02527">"For the dead man, yes," replied M. de Boville, "but not for the
survivor; on the contrary, this Dantes saw a means of accelerating his
escape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Chateau
d'If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the
dead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they had
sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment."</p>

<p id="id02528">"It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage," remarked the<br/>

Englishman.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02529">"As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,
fortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears
it had on his account."</p>

<p id="id02530">"How was that?"</p>

<p id="id02531">"How? Do you not comprehend?"</p>

<p id="id02532">"No."</p>

<p id="id02533">"The Chateau d'If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into
the sea, after fastening a thirty-six pound cannon-ball to their feet."</p>

<p id="id02534">"Well," observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.</p>

<p id="id02535">"Well, they fastened a thirty-six pound ball to his feet, and threw him
into the sea."</p>

<p id="id02536">"Really!" exclaimed the Englishman.</p>

<p id="id02537">"Yes, sir," continued the inspector of prisons. "You may imagine the
amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the
rocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment."</p>

<p id="id02538">"That would have been difficult."</p>

<p id="id02539">"No matter," replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty
of recovering his two hundred thousand francs,—"no matter, I can fancy
it." And he shouted with laughter.</p>

<p id="id02540">"So can I," said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as
the English do, "at the end of his teeth."</p>

<p id="id02541">"And so," continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, "he
was drowned?"</p>

<p id="id02542">"Unquestionably."</p>

<p id="id02543">"So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at
the same time?"</p>

<p id="id02544">"Precisely."</p>

<p id="id02545">"But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?"
inquired the Englishman.</p>

<p id="id02546">"Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition. You understand, Dantes' relations,
if he had any, might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or
alive."</p>

<p id="id02547">"So that now, if there were anything to inherit from him, they may do so
with easy conscience. He is dead, and no mistake about it."</p>

<p id="id02548">"Oh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please."</p>

<p id="id02549">"So be it," said the Englishman. "But to return to these registers."</p>

<p id="id02550">"True, this story has diverted our attention from them. Excuse me."</p>

<p id="id02551">"Excuse you for what? For the story? By no means; it really seems to me
very curious."</p>

<p id="id02552">"Yes, indeed. So, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor abbe,
who really was gentleness itself."</p>

<p id="id02553">"Yes, you will much oblige me."</p>

<p id="id02554">"Go into my study here, and I will show it to you." And they both
entered M. de Boville's study. Everything was here arranged in perfect
order; each register had its number, each file of papers its place. The
inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself in an arm-chair, and
placed before him the register and documents relative to the Chateau
d'If, giving him all the time he desired for the examination, while De
Boville seated himself in a corner, and began to read his newspaper. The
Englishman easily found the entries relative to the Abbe Faria; but it
seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him
greatly, for after having perused the first documents he turned over the
leaves until he reached the deposition respecting Edmond Dantes. There
he found everything arranged in due order,—the accusation, examination,
Morrel's petition, M. de Villefort's marginal notes. He folded up
the accusation quietly, and put it as quietly in his pocket; read the
examination, and saw that the name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it;
perused, too, the application dated 10th April, 1815, in which Morrel,
by the deputy procureur's advice, exaggerated with the best intentions
(for Napoleon was then on the throne) the services Dantes had rendered
to the imperial cause—services which Villefort's certificates rendered
indispensable. Then he saw through the whole thing. This petition
to Napoleon, kept back by Villefort, had become, under the second
restoration, a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king's
attorney. He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the
register this note, placed in a bracket against his name:—</p>

<p id="id02555">Edmond Dantes.</p>

<p id="id02556">An inveterate Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from the<br/>

Island of Elba.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02557">To be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched and
guarded.</p>

<p id="id02558">Beneath these lines was written in another hand: "See note
above—nothing can be done." He compared the writing in the bracket with
the writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrel's petition, and
discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the
certificate—that is to say, was in Villefort's handwriting. As to the
note which accompanied this, the Englishman understood that it might
have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in
Dantes' situation, but who had, from the remarks we have quoted, found
it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt.</p>

<p id="id02559">As we have said, the inspector, from discretion, and that he might not
disturb the Abbe Faria's pupil in his researches, had seated himself
in a corner, and was reading Le Drapeau Blanc. He did not see the
Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by
Danglars under the arbor of La Reserve, and which had the postmark,
"Marseilles, 27th Feb., delivery 6 o'clock, P.M." But it must be said
that if he had seen it, he attached so little importance to this scrap
of paper, and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs,
that he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do, however
irregular it might be.</p>

<p id="id02560">"Thanks," said the latter, closing the register with a slam, "I have
all I want; now it is for me to perform my promise. Give me a simple
assignment of your debt; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash,
and I will hand you over the money." He rose, gave his seat to M. de
Boville, who took it without ceremony, and quickly drew up the required
assignment, while the Englishman counted out the bank-notes on the other
side of the desk.</p>

<h3 id="id02561" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 29. The House of Morrel &amp; Son.</h3>

<p id="id02562">Any one who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously, well
acquainted with the interior of Morrel's warehouse, and had returned at
this date, would have found a great change. Instead of that air of life,
of comfort, and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous
business establishment—instead of merry faces at the windows, busy
clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors—instead of the court
filled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and the jokes of
porters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and
gloom. Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted
corridor and the empty office, but two remained. One was a young man of
three or four and twenty, who was in love with M. Morrel's daughter, and
had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce
him to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed cashier, called "Cocles,"
or "Cock-eye," a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng
this vast now almost deserted bee-hive, and which had so completely
replaced his real name that he would not, in all probability, have
replied to any one who addressed him by it.</p>

<p id="id02563">Cocles remained in M. Morrel's service, and a most singular change had
taken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank
of cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant. He was, however, the
same Cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of
arithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against the
world, even against M. Morrel; and strong in the multiplication-table,
which he had at his fingers' ends, no matter what scheme or what trap
was laid to catch him. In the midst of the disasters that befell the
house, Cocles was the only one unmoved. But this did not arise from a
want of affection; on the contrary, from a firm conviction. Like the
rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel
weighs anchor, so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the
office and the warehouse. Cocles had seen them go without thinking of
inquiring the cause of their departure. Everything was as we have said,
a question of arithmetic to Cocles, and during twenty years he had
always seen all payments made with such exactitude, that it seemed as
impossible to him that the house should stop payment, as it would to a
miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to
flow.</p>

<p id="id02564">Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles' belief; the last month's
payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; Cocles had
detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same
evening he had brought them to M. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile,
threw them into an almost empty drawer, saying:—</p>

<p id="id02565">"Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers."</p>

<p id="id02566">Cocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel,
himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more
than a present of fifty crowns. But since the end of the month M. Morrel
had passed many an anxious hour. In order to meet the payments then due;
he had collected all his resources, and, fearing lest the report of his
distress should get bruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be
reduced to such an extremity, he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his
wife's and daughter's jewels and a portion of his plate. By this means
the end of the month was passed, but his resources were now exhausted.
Credit, owing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had; and to
meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 10th of the present
month, and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next
month to M. de Boville, M. Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the
return of the Pharaon, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel
which had weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived
in harbor. But this vessel which, like the Pharaon, came from Calcutta,
had been in for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been received of
the Pharaon.</p>

<p id="id02567">Such was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with M.
de Boville, the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French
of Rome, presented himself at M. Morrel's. Emmanuel received him; this
young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face, for every new
face might be that of a new creditor, come in anxiety to question the
head of the house. The young man, wishing to spare his employer the pain
of this interview, questioned the new-comer; but the stranger declared
that he had nothing to say to M. Emmanuel, and that his business was
with M. Morrel in person. Emmanuel sighed, and summoned Cocles. Cocles
appeared, and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel's
apartment. Cocles went first, and the stranger followed him. On the
staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen, who looked
with anxiety at the stranger.</p>

<p id="id02568">"M. Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?" said the
cashier.</p>

<p id="id02569">"Yes; I think so, at least," said the young girl hesitatingly. "Go and
see, Cocles, and if my father is there, announce this gentleman."</p>

<p id="id02570">"It will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle," returned the
Englishman. "M. Morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has
only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French
of Rome, with whom your father does business."</p>

<p id="id02571">The young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger
and Cocles continued to mount the staircase. She entered the office
where Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed,
opened a door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase,
conducted the stranger into an ante-chamber, opened a second door, which
he closed behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of
Thomson &amp; French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.
The Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning over
the formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of his
liabilities. At the sight of the stranger, M. Morrel closed the ledger,
arose, and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen him
seated, resumed his own chair. Fourteen years had changed the worthy
merchant, who, in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this history,
was now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white, time and sorrow
had ploughed deep furrows on his brow, and his look, once so firm and
penetrating, was now irresolute and wandering, as if he feared being
forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person. The
Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently mingled
with interest. "Monsieur," said Morrel, whose uneasiness was increased
by this examination, "you wish to speak to me?"</p>

<p id="id02572">"Yes, monsieur; you are aware from whom I come?"</p>

<p id="id02573">"The house of Thomson &amp; French; at least, so my cashier tells me."</p>

<p id="id02574">"He has told you rightly. The house of Thomson &amp; French had 300,000 or
400,000 francs to pay this month in France; and, knowing your strict
punctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature, and
charged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money
otherwise." Morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead,
which was covered with perspiration.</p>

<p id="id02575">"So then, sir," said Morrel, "you hold bills of mine?"</p>

<p id="id02576">"Yes, and for a considerable sum."</p>

<p id="id02577">"What is the amount?" asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render
firm.</p>

<p id="id02578">"Here is," said the Englishman, taking a quantity of papers from his
pocket, "an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M. de Boville,
the inspector of prisons, to whom they are due. You acknowledge, of
course, that you owe this sum to him?"</p>

<p id="id02579">"Yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly
five years ago."</p>

<p id="id02580">"When are you to pay?"</p>

<p id="id02581">"Half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next."</p>

<p id="id02582">"Just so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are all
signed by you, and assigned to our house by the holders."</p>

<p id="id02583">"I recognize them," said Morrel, whose face was suffused, as he thought
that, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to honor his
own signature. "Is this all?"</p>

<p id="id02584">"No, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been
assigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild &amp; Turner of
Marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000. francs; in all, 287,500
francs." It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during
this enumeration. "Two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred
francs," repeated he.</p>

<p id="id02585">"Yes, sir," replied the Englishman. "I will not," continued he, after
a moment's silence, "conceal from you, that while your probity and
exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged, yet the
report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your
liabilities." At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly
pale. "Sir," said he, "up to this time—and it is now more than
four-and-twenty years since I received the direction of this house from
my father, who had himself conducted it for five and thirty years—never
has anything bearing the signature of Morrel &amp; Son been dishonored."</p>

<p id="id02586">"I know that," replied the Englishman. "But as a man of honor should
answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same
punctuality?" Morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with
more assurance than he had hitherto shown. "To questions frankly put,"
said he, "a straightforward answer should be given. Yes, I shall pay,
if, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely; for its arrival will again
procure me the credit which the numerous accidents, of which I have been
the victim, have deprived me; but if the Pharaon should be lost, and
this last resource be gone"—the poor man's eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p id="id02587">"Well," said the other, "if this last resource fail you?"</p>

<p id="id02588">"Well," returned Morrel, "it is a cruel thing to be forced to say, but,
already used to misfortune, I must habituate myself to shame. I fear I
shall be forced to suspend payment."</p>

<p id="id02589">"Have you no friends who could assist you?" Morrel smiled mournfully.<br/>

"In business, sir," said he, "one has no friends, only correspondents."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02590">"It is true," murmured the Englishman; "then you have but one hope."</p>

<p id="id02591">"But one."</p>

<p id="id02592">"The last?"</p>

<p id="id02593">"The last."</p>

<p id="id02594">"So that if this fail"—</p>

<p id="id02595">"I am ruined,—completely ruined!"</p>

<p id="id02596">"As I was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port."</p>

<p id="id02597">"I know it, sir; a young man, who still adheres to my fallen fortunes,
passes a part of his time in a belvidere at the top of the house, in
hopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has informed me
of the arrival of this ship."</p>

<p id="id02598">"And it is not yours?"</p>

<p id="id02599">"No, she is a Bordeaux vessel, La Gironde; she comes from India also;
but she is not mine."</p>
