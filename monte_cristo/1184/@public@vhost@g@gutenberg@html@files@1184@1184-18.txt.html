  <body><p id="id04657">"Alas, sir," said Monte Cristo "this spectacle is neither strange to
my eye nor my thought. I am something of a physician, and have, like
my fellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead
matter; yet, like providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes,
although present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca,
St. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison
you have made, and yet I can well understand that a father's sufferings
may effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on you,
sir, since you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this
terrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to
your family."</p>

<p id="id04658">"It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a
compensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way
to the tomb, are two children just entering into life—Valentine,
the daughter by my first wife—Mademoiselle Renee de Saint-Meran—and
Edward, the boy whose life you have this day saved."</p>

<p id="id04659">"And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?" inquired Monte<br/>

Cristo.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id04660">"My deduction is," replied Villefort, "that my father, led away by his
passions, has committed some fault unknown to human justice, but marked
by the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but
one person, has visited this justice on him alone." Monte Cristo with a
smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would
have made Villefort fly had he but heard it. "Adieu, sir," said the
magistrate, who had risen from his seat; "I leave you, bearing a
remembrance of you—a remembrance of esteem, which I hope will not be
disagreeable to you when you know me better; for I am not a man to bore
my friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have made an eternal friend
of Madame de Villefort." The count bowed, and contented himself with
seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet, the procureur being
escorted to his carriage by two footmen, who, on a signal from their
master, followed him with every mark of attention. When he had gone,
Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh, and said,—"Enough of this
poison, let me now seek the antidote." Then sounding his bell, he said
to Ali, who entered, "I am going to madam's chamber—have the carriage
ready at one o'clock."</p>

<h3 id="id04661" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 49. Haidee.</h3>

<p id="id04662">It will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the
Count of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other than
Maximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel. The very anticipations of delight to
be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits—the bright, pure gleam of heavenly
happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had
voluntarily engaged, illumined his whole countenance with a look of
ineffable joy and calmness, as, immediately after Villefort's departure,
his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting,
at least, a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his
mind. Even Ali, who had hastened to obey the Count's summons, went forth
from his master's presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation
and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while,
as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over
his patron's meditations, whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked
on tiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound
should dissipate his master's happy reverie.</p>

<p id="id04663">It was noon, and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the
apartments of Haidee, as though his oppressed spirit could not all at
once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy, but required a gradual
succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive
full and perfect happiness, in the same manner as ordinary natures
demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent
sensations. The young Greek, as we have already said, occupied
apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count. The rooms had
been fitted up in strict accordance with Oriental ideas; the floors were
covered with the richest carpets Turkey could produce; the walls hung
with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture; while
around each chamber luxurious divans were placed, with piles of soft and
yielding cushions, that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or
convenience of such as sought repose. Haidee and three French maids,
and one who was a Greek. The first three remained constantly in a small
waiting-room, ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell, or to
receive the orders of the Romaic slave, who knew just enough French
to be able to transmit her mistress's wishes to the three other
waiting-women; the latter had received most peremptory instructions from
Monte Cristo to treat Haidee with all the deference they would observe
to a queen.</p>

<p id="id04664">The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the
farther end of her apartments. This was a sort of boudoir, circular,
and lighted only from the roof, which consisted of rose-colored glass.
Haidee was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin
spotted with silver; her head, supported by one of her exquisitely
moulded arms, rested on the divan immediately behind her, while the
other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich
narghile, through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its
passage through perfumed water. Her attitude, though perfectly natural
for an Eastern woman would, in a European, have been deemed too full
of coquettish straining after effect. Her dress, which was that of
the women of Epirus, consisted of a pair of white satin trousers,
embroidered with pink roses, displaying feet so exquisitely formed and
so delicately fair, that they might well have been taken for Parian
marble, had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they
constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned
toes, beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls. She wore a blue and
white-striped vest, with long open sleeves, trimmed with silver loops
and buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice, which, closing only from
the centre to the waist, exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and
upper part of the bosom; it was fastened with three magnificent diamond
clasps. The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed
by one of the many-colored scarfs, whose brilliant hues and rich silken
fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles.
Tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold-colored silk,
embroidered with pearls; while on the other a purple rose mingled its
glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of which the
blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue. The extreme
beauty of the countenance, that shone forth in loveliness that mocked
the vain attempts of dress to augment it, was peculiarly and purely
Grecian; there were the large, dark, melting eyes, the finely formed
nose, the coral lips, and pearly teeth, that belonged to her race and
country. And, to complete the whole, Haidee was in the very springtide
and fulness of youthful charms—she had not yet numbered more than
twenty summers.</p>

<p id="id04665">Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant, and bade her inquire whether
it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit. Haidee's
only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the
tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir, the
framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the
graceful tableau presented by the young girl's picturesque attitude and
appearance. As Monte Cristo approached, she leaned upon the elbow of the
arm that held the narghile, and extending to him her other hand, said,
with a smile of captivating sweetness, in the sonorous language spoken
by the women of Athens and Sparta, "Why demand permission ere you enter?
Are you no longer my master, or have I ceased to be your slave?" Monte
Cristo returned her smile. "Haidee," said he, "you well know."</p>

<p id="id04666">"Why do you address me so coldly—so distantly?" asked the young Greek.
"Have I by any means displeased you? Oh, if so, punish me as you
will; but do not—do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and
constrained."</p>

<p id="id04667">"Haidee," replied the count, "you know that you are now in France, and
are free."</p>

<p id="id04668">"Free to do what?" asked the young girl.</p>

<p id="id04669">"Free to leave me."</p>

<p id="id04670">"Leave you? Why should I leave you?"</p>

<p id="id04671">"That is not for me to say; but we are now about to mix in society—to
visit and be visited."</p>

<p id="id04672">"I don't wish to see anybody but you."</p>

<p id="id04673">"And should you see one whom you could prefer, I would not be so
unjust"—</p>

<p id="id04674">"I have never seen any one I preferred to you, and I have never loved
any one but you and my father."</p>

<p id="id04675">"My poor child," replied Monte Cristo, "that is merely because your
father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you."</p>

<p id="id04676">"I don't want anybody else to talk to me. My father said I was his
'joy'—you style me your 'love,'—and both of you have called me 'my
child.'"</p>

<p id="id04677">"Do you remember your father, Haidee?" The young Greek smiled. "He is
here, and here," said she, touching her eyes and her heart. "And where
am I?" inquired Monte Cristo laughingly.</p>

<p id="id04678">"You?" cried she, with tones of thrilling tenderness, "you are
everywhere!" Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in
his, and was about to raise it to his lips, when the simple child
of nature hastily withdrew it, and presented her cheek. "You now
understand, Haidee," said the count, "that from this moment you are
absolutely free; that here you exercise unlimited sway, and are at
liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country, as it may
suit your inclination. Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of
your actions, and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem
most agreeable to you. A carriage waits your orders, and Ali and Myrtho
will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go. There is but one
favor I would entreat of you."</p>

<p id="id04679">"Speak."</p>

<p id="id04680">"Guard carefully the secret of your birth. Make no allusion to the
past; nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your
illustrious father or ill-fated mother."</p>

<p id="id04681">"I have already told you, my lord, that I shall see no one."</p>

<p id="id04682">"It is possible, Haidee, that so perfect a seclusion, though conformable
with the habits and customs of the East, may not be practicable in
Paris. Endeavor, then, to accustom yourself to our manner of living in
these northern climes as you did to those of Rome, Florence, Milan, and
Madrid; it may be useful to you one of these days, whether you remain
here or return to the East." The young girl raised her tearful eyes
towards Monte Cristo as she said with touching earnestness, "Whether we
return to the East, you mean to say, my lord, do you not?"</p>

<p id="id04683">"My child," returned Monte Cristo "you know full well that whenever we
part, it will be no fault or wish of mine; the tree forsakes not the
flower—the flower falls from the tree."</p>

<p id="id04684">"My lord," replied Haidee, "I never will leave you, for I am sure I
could not exist without you."</p>

<p id="id04685">"My poor girl, in ten years I shall be old, and you will be still
young."</p>

<p id="id04686">"My father had a long white beard, but I loved him; he was sixty years
old, but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw."</p>

<p id="id04687">"Then tell me, Haidee, do you believe you shall be able to accustom
yourself to our present mode of life?"</p>

<p id="id04688">"Shall I see you?"</p>

<p id="id04689">"Every day."</p>

<p id="id04690">"Then what do you fear, my lord?"</p>

<p id="id04691">"You might find it dull."</p>

<p id="id04692">"No, my lord. In the morning, I shall rejoice in the prospect of your
coming, and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have
enjoyed in your presence; then too, when alone, I can call forth mighty
pictures of the past, see vast horizons bounded only by the towering
mountains of Pindus and Olympus. Oh, believe me, that when three great
passions, such as sorrow, love, and gratitude fill the heart, ennui can
find no place."</p>

<p id="id04693">"You are a worthy daughter of Epirus, Haidee, and your charming and
poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who
claim your country as their birthplace. Depend on my care to see
that your youth is not blighted, or suffered to pass away in ungenial
solitude; and of this be well assured, that if you love me as a father,
I love you as a child."</p>

<p id="id04694">"You are wrong, my lord. The love I have for you is very different from
the love I had for my father. My father died, but I did not die. If
you were to die, I should die too." The Count, with a smile of profound
tenderness, extended his hand, and she carried it to her lips. Monte
Cristo, thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with Morrel
and his family, departed, murmuring as he went these lines of Pindar,
"Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit; happy is he who, after
having watched its silent growth, is permitted to gather and call it
his own." The carriage was prepared according to orders, and stepping
lightly into it, the count drove off at his usual rapid pace.</p>

<h3 id="id04695" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 50. The Morrel Family.</h3>

<p id="id04696">In a very few minutes the count reached No. 7 in the Rue Meslay. The
house was of white stone, and in a small court before it were two small
beds full of beautiful flowers. In the concierge that opened the gate
the count recognized Cocles; but as he had but one eye, and that eye
had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years, Cocles did not
recognize the count. The carriages that drove up to the door were
compelled to turn, to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of
rockwork,—an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole
quarter, and had gained for the place the appellation of "The Little
Versailles." It is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish
in the basin. The house, with kitchens and cellars below, had above
the ground-floor, two stories and attics. The whole of the property,
consisting of an immense workshop, two pavilions at the bottom of the
garden, and the garden itself, had been purchased by Emmanuel, who had
seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation. He
had reserved the house and half the garden, and building a wall between
the garden and the workshops, had let them upon lease with the pavilions
at the bottom of the garden. So that for a trifling sum he was as well
lodged, and as perfectly shut out from observation, as the inhabitants
of the finest mansion in the Faubourg St. Germain. The breakfast-room
was finished in oak; the salon in mahogany, and the furnishings were of
blue velvet; the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask. There was
a study for Emmanuel, who never studied, and a music-room for Julie,
who never played. The whole of the second story was set apart for
Maximilian; it was precisely similar to his sister's apartments, except
that for the breakfast-parlor he had a billiard-room, where he received
his friends. He was superintending the grooming of his horse, and
smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden, when the count's
carriage stopped at the gate.</p>

<p id="id04697">Cocles opened the gate, and Baptistin, springing from the box, inquired
whether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel
would see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo. "The Count of Monte
Cristo?" cried Morrel, throwing away his cigar and hastening to the
carriage; "I should think we would see him. Ah, a thousand thanks,
count, for not having forgotten your promise." And the young officer
shook the count's hand so warmly, that Monte Cristo could not be
mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy, and he saw that he had been
expected with impatience, and was received with pleasure. "Come, come,"
said Maximilian, "I will serve as your guide; such a man as you are
ought not to be introduced by a servant. My sister is in the garden
plucking the dead roses; my brother is reading his two papers, the
Presse and the Debats, within six steps of her; for wherever you see
Madame Herbault, you have only to look within a circle of four yards
and you will find M. Emmanuel, and 'reciprocally,' as they say at the
Polytechnic School." At the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty
to five and twenty, dressed in a silk morning gown, and busily engaged
in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose-tree, raised her head.
This was Julie, who had become, as the clerk of the house of Thomson
&amp; French had predicted, Madame Emmanuel Herbault. She uttered a cry
of surprise at the sight of a stranger, and Maximilian began to laugh.
"Don't disturb yourself, Julie," said he. "The count has only been two
or three days in Paris, but he already knows what a fashionable woman of
the Marais is, and if he does not, you will show him."</p>

<p id="id04698">"Ah, monsieur," returned Julie, "it is treason in my brother to bring
you thus, but he never has any regard for his poor sister. Penelon,
Penelon!" An old man, who was digging busily at one of the beds, stuck
his spade in the earth, and approached, cap in hand, striving to conceal
a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek. A few locks of
gray mingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his
bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had
braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics. "I think
you hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?" said he. Penelon had still preserved
the habit of calling his master's daughter "Mademoiselle Julie," and
had never been able to change the name to Madame Herbault. "Penelon,"
replied Julie, "go and inform M. Emmanuel of this gentleman's visit,
and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon." Then, turning to Monte
Cristo,—"I hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes,"
continued she; and without awaiting any reply, disappeared behind a
clump of trees, and escaped to the house by a lateral alley.</p>

<p id="id04699">"I am sorry to see," observed Monte Cristo to Morrel, "that I cause no
small disturbance in your house."</p>

<p id="id04700">"Look there," said Maximilian, laughing; "there is her husband changing
his jacket for a coat. I assure you, you are well known in the Rue
Meslay."</p>

<p id="id04701">"Your family appears to be a very happy one," said the count, as if
speaking to himself.</p>

<p id="id04702">"Oh, yes, I assure you, count, they want nothing that can render them
happy; they are young and cheerful, they are tenderly attached to each
other, and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves
as rich as Rothschild."</p>

<p id="id04703">"Five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum, however,"
replied Monte Cristo, with a tone so sweet and gentle, that it went to
Maximilian's heart like the voice of a father; "but they will not be
content with that. Your brother-in-law is a barrister? a doctor?"</p>

<p id="id04704">"He was a merchant, monsieur, and had succeeded to the business of my
poor father. M. Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were
divided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children. Her
husband, who, when he married her, had no other patrimony than his noble
probity, his first-rate ability, and his spotless reputation, wished to
possess as much as his wife. He labored and toiled until he had amassed
250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object. Oh, I assure
you, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures,
destined by their talents for higher stations, toiling together, and
through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their
paternal house, taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous
people would have effected in two or three. Marseilles resounded with
their well-earned praises. At last, one day, Emmanuel came to his wife,
who had just finished making up the accounts. 'Julie,' said he to her,
'Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs; that
completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains.
Can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess
for the future? Listen to me. Our house transacts business to the amount
of a million a year, from which we derive an income of 40,000 francs.
We can dispose of the business, if we please, in an hour, for I have
received a letter from M. Delaunay, in which he offers to purchase
the good-will of the house, to unite with his own, for 300,000 francs.
Advise me what I had better do.'—'Emmanuel,' returned my sister, 'the
house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel. Is it not worth
300,000 francs to save our father's name from the chances of evil
fortune and failure?'—'I thought so,' replied Emmanuel; 'but I wished
to have your advice.'—'This is my counsel:—Our accounts are made up
and our bills paid; all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more,
and close our office.' This was done instantly. It was three o'clock; at
a quarter past, a merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was
a clear profit of 15,000. francs. 'Monsieur,' said Emmanuel, 'have
the goodness to address yourself to M. Delaunay. We have quitted
business.'—'How long?' inquired the astonished merchant. 'A quarter of
an hour,' was the reply. And this is the reason, monsieur," continued
Maximilian, "of my sister and brother-in-law having only 25,000 francs a
year."</p>

<p id="id04705">Maximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the count's
heart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and
coat. He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the
rank of his guest; then, after having led Monte Cristo around the little
garden, he returned to the house. A large vase of Japan porcelain,
filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume, stood in
the salon. Julie, suitably dressed, and her hair arranged (she had
accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes), received the count on
his entrance. The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by,
and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite
framework to the blue velvet curtains. Everything in this charming
retreat, from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress,
breathed tranquillity and repose. The count had felt the influence of
this happiness from the moment he entered the house, and he remained
silent and pensive, forgetting that he was expected to renew the
conversation, which had ceased after the first salutations had been
exchanged. The silence became almost painful when, by a violent effort,
tearing himself from his pleasing reverie—"Madame," said he at length,
"I pray you to excuse my emotion, which must astonish you who are only
accustomed to the happiness I meet here; but contentment is so new a
sight to me, that I could never be weary of looking at yourself and your
husband."</p>

<p id="id04706">"We are very happy, monsieur," replied Julie; "but we have also known
unhappiness, and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than
ourselves." The Count's features displayed an expression of the most
intense curiosity.</p>

<p id="id04707">"Oh, all this is a family history, as Chateau-Renaud told you the other
day," observed Maximilian. "This humble picture would have but little
interest for you, accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the
misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious; but such as we are, we have
experienced bitter sorrows."</p>

<p id="id04708">"And God has poured balm into your wounds, as he does into those of all
who are in affliction?" said Monte Cristo inquiringly.</p>

<p id="id04709">"Yes, count," returned Julie, "we may indeed say he has, for he has done
for us what he grants only to his chosen; he sent us one of his angels."
The count's cheeks became scarlet, and he coughed, in order to have an
excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth. "Those born to wealth,
and who have the means of gratifying every wish," said Emmanuel, "know
not what is the real happiness of life, just as those who have been
tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone
realize the blessings of fair weather."</p>

<p id="id04710">Monte Cristo rose, and without making any answer (for the tremulousness
of his voice would have betrayed his emotion) walked up and down the
apartment with a slow step.</p>

<p id="id04711">"Our magnificence makes you smile, count," said Maximilian, who had
followed him with his eyes. "No, no," returned Monte Cristo, pale as
death, pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings, while
with the other he pointed to a crystal cover, beneath which a silken
purse lay on a black velvet cushion. "I was wondering what could be
the significance of this purse, with the paper at one end and the large
diamond at the other."</p>

<p id="id04712">"Count," replied Maximilian, with an air of gravity, "those are our most
precious family treasures."</p>

<p id="id04713">"The stone seems very brilliant," answered the count.</p>

<p id="id04714">"Oh, my brother does not allude to its value, although it has been
estimated at 100,000 francs; he means, that the articles contained in
this purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now."</p>

<p id="id04715">"This I do not comprehend; and yet I may not ask for an explanation,
madame," replied Monte Cristo bowing. "Pardon me, I had no intention of
committing an indiscretion."</p>

<p id="id04716">"Indiscretion,—oh, you make us happy by giving us an excuse for
expatiating on this subject. If we wanted to conceal the noble action
this purse commemorates, we should not expose it thus to view. Oh, would
we could relate it everywhere, and to every one, so that the emotion of
our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence."</p>

<p id="id04717">"Ah, really," said Monte Cristo in a half-stifled voice.</p>

<p id="id04718">"Monsieur," returned Maximilian, raising the glass cover, and
respectfully kissing the silken purse, "this has touched the hand of a
man who saved my father from suicide, us from ruin, and our name from
shame and disgrace,—a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor
children, doomed to want and wretchedness, can at present hear every
one envying our happy lot. This letter" (as he spoke, Maximilian drew
a letter from the purse and gave it to the count)—"this letter was
written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution,
and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as
her dowry." Monte Cristo opened the letter, and read it with an
indescribable feeling of delight. It was the letter written (as our
readers know) to Julie, and signed "Sinbad the Sailor." "Unknown you
say, is the man who rendered you this service—unknown to you?"</p>

<p id="id04719">"Yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand," continued
Maximilian. "We have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this
favor, but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we
cannot comprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand,—a hand as
powerful as that of an enchanter."</p>

<p id="id04720">"Oh," cried Julie, "I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that
hand, as I now kiss the purse which he has touched. Four years ago,
Penelon was at Trieste—Penelon, count, is the old sailor you saw in the
garden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardener—Penelon, when
he was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the point
of embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person
who called on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this
letter on the fifth of September. He felt convinced of his identity, but
he did not venture to address him."</p>

<p id="id04721">"An Englishman," said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the attention
with which Julie looked at him. "An Englishman you say?"</p>

<p id="id04722">"Yes," replied Maximilian, "an Englishman, who represented himself as
the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French, at Rome. It was
this that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de Morcerf's,
that Messrs. Thomson &amp; French were your bankers. That happened, as
I told you, in 1829. For God's sake, tell me, did you know this
Englishman?"</p>

<p id="id04723">"But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson &amp; French have
constantly denied having rendered you this service?"</p>

<p id="id04724">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id04725">"Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be some one who,
grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself
had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?"</p>

<p id="id04726">"Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle."</p>

<p id="id04727">"What was his name?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04728">"He gave no other name," answered Julie, looking earnestly at the count,
"than that at the end of his letter—'Sinbad the Sailor.'"</p>

<p id="id04729">"Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one."</p>

<p id="id04730">Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice,—</p>

<p id="id04731">"Tell me," continued he, "was he not about my height, perhaps a little
taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat
closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?"</p>

<p id="id04732">"Oh, do you then know him?" cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.</p>

<p id="id04733">"No," returned Monte Cristo "I only guessed. I knew a Lord Wilmore, who
was constantly doing actions of this kind."</p>

<p id="id04734">"Without revealing himself?"</p>

<p id="id04735">"He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of
gratitude."</p>

<p id="id04736">"Oh, heaven," exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, "in what did he
believe, then?"</p>

<p id="id04737">"He did not credit it at the period which I knew him," said Monte
Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie's voice; "but,
perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist."</p>

<p id="id04738">"And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?" inquired Emmanuel.</p>

<p id="id04739">"Oh, if you do know him," cried Julie, "can you tell us where he
is—where we can find him? Maximilian—Emmanuel—if we do but discover
him, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!" Monte Cristo felt
tears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily up and down the
room.</p>

<p id="id04740">"In the name of heaven," said Maximilian, "if you know anything of him,
tell us what it is."</p>

<p id="id04741">"Alas," cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, "if Lord
Wilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him
again. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on
the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he
will never return."</p>

<p id="id04742">"Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you," said Julie, much affected; and the
young lady's eyes swam with tears.</p>

<p id="id04743">"Madame," replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two
liquid pearls that trickled down Julie's cheeks, "had Lord Wilmore seen
what I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you shed
would reconcile him to mankind;" and he held out his hand to Julie, who
gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the count. "But,"
continued she, "Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must have known
some one, can we not—"</p>

<p id="id04744">"Oh, it is useless to inquire," returned the count; "perhaps, after all,
he was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no secrets
from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me."</p>

<p id="id04745">"And he told you nothing?"</p>

<p id="id04746">"Not a word."</p>

<p id="id04747">"Nothing that would lead you to suppose?"</p>

<p id="id04748">"Nothing."</p>

<p id="id04749">"And yet you spoke of him at once."</p>

<p id="id04750">"Ah, in such a case one supposes"—</p>

<p id="id04751">"Sister, sister," said Maximilian, coming to the count's aid, "monsieur
is quite right. Recollect what our excellent father so often told us,
'It was no Englishman that thus saved us.'" Monte Cristo started. "What
did your father tell you, M. Morrel?" said he eagerly.</p>

<p id="id04752">"My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed—he
believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us. Oh,
it was a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself
believe it, I would not for the world have destroyed my father's faith.
How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend—a
friend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the near approach
of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural
light, this thought, which had until then been but a doubt, became
a conviction, and his last words were, 'Maximilian, it was Edmond
Dantes!'" At these words the count's paleness, which had for some time
been increasing, became alarming; he could not speak; he looked at his
watch like a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words
to Madame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and
Maximilian,—"Madame," said he, "I trust you will allow me to visit you
occasionally; I value your friendship, and feel grateful to you for
your welcome, for this is the first time for many years that I have thus
yielded to my feelings;" and he hastily quitted the apartment.</p>

<p id="id04753">"This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man," said Emmanuel.</p>

<p id="id04754">"Yes," answered Maximilian, "but I feel sure he has an excellent heart,
and that he likes us."</p>

<p id="id04755">"His voice went to my heart," observed Julie; "and two or three times I
fancied that I had heard it before."</p>

<h3 id="id04756" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe.</h3>

<p id="id04757">About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honore, and in the
rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood,
where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design
and magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the
wide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in
a solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower
of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that
stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate,
that dated from the time of Louis XII. This noble entrance, however,
in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the
geraniums planted in the two vases, as they waved their variegated
leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom, had
fallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of the mansion had many years
before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the
house itself, with its thickly planted court-yard, opening into the
Faubourg Saint-Honore, and to the garden shut in by this gate, which
formerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of about an acre. For
the demon of speculation drew a line, or in other words projected a
street, at the farther side of the kitchen-garden. The street was
laid out, a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate, but before
construction was begun, it occurred to the possessor of the property
that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted
to fruits and vegetables, by building along the line of the proposed
street, and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg
Saint-Honore itself, one of the most important thoroughfares in the city
of Paris.</p>

<p id="id04758">In matters of speculation, however, though "man proposes," "money
disposes." From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost
in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high
price for it, and being quite unable to find any one willing to take his
bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging
to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that
would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the interest
upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented himself
with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a
yearly rental of 500 francs. And so, as we have said, the iron gate
leading into the kitchen-garden had been closed up and left to the rust,
which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges, while to prevent the
ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming
to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate
had been boarded up to a height of six feet. True, the planks were not
so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through
their interstices; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the
inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage
would be taken of that circumstance.</p>

<p id="id04759">Horticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted
kitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, pease, and melons
had once flourished, a scanty crop of lucerne alone bore evidence of its
being deemed worthy of cultivation. A small, low door gave egress from
the walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the
ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters, and
had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not
even the one-half per cent it had originally paid. Towards the house
the chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall,
without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and
flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as
though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one
corner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a
large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered
spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant
of the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of
verdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred paces
off.</p>

<p id="id04760">Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary
of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in
the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the
screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no
entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the
incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from
either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion. On the
evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the
inhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone
bench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which hung a partly
embroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little distance from these
articles was a young woman, standing close to the iron gate, endeavoring
to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the
planks,—the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which
she seemed to seek the object of her wishes, proving how much her
feelings were interested in the matter. At that instant the little
side-gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly
opened, and a tall, powerful young man appeared. He was dressed in a
common gray blouse and velvet cap, but his carefully arranged hair,
beard and mustache, all of the richest and glossiest black, ill accorded
with his plebeian attire. After casting a rapid glance around him, in
order to assure himself that he was unobserved, he entered by the small
gate, and, carefully closing and securing it after him, proceeded with a
hurried step towards the barrier.</p>

<p id="id04761">At the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume,
the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty
retreat. But the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow
chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and
observed the fluttering of the blue sash. Pressing his lips close to the
planks, he exclaimed, "Don't be alarmed, Valentine—it is I!" Again the
timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as she did so,
"And why do you come so late to-day? It is almost dinner-time, and I had
to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother-in-law, my
too-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me
about coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never to
get done. So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me
wait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that
at first I did not recognize you."</p>

<p id="id04762">"Dearest Valentine," said the young man, "the difference between our
respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love,
but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour
forth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you. If it be but to
carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even
thank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if
you did not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to
suppose), at least I was in your thoughts. You asked me the cause of my
being late, and why I come disguised. I will candidly explain the reason
of both, and I trust to your goodness to pardon me. I have chosen a
trade."</p>

<p id="id04763">"A trade? Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such
deep cause for uneasiness?"</p>

<p id="id04764">"Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than
life itself! But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about
it. I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously
alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about here
your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief. That
would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of the
fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place
where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well
create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted
the costume of my calling."</p>

<p id="id04765">"What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!"</p>

<p id="id04766">"Nonsense? Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my life
by such a name. Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually screen
our meetings from all suspicion or danger."</p>

<p id="id04767">"I beseech of you, Maximilian, to cease trifling, and tell me what you
really mean."</p>

<p id="id04768">"Simply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I
stand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by
the proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucerne. Think
of that, Valentine! There is nothing now to prevent my building myself
a little hut on my plantation, and residing not twenty yards from you.
Only imagine what happiness that would afford me. I can scarcely contain
myself at the bare idea. Such felicity seems above all price—as a thing
impossible and unattainable. But would you believe that I purchase all
this delight, joy, and happiness, for which I would cheerfully have
surrendered ten years of my life, at the small cost of 500 francs per
annum, paid quarterly? Henceforth we have nothing to fear. I am on my
own ground, and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the
wall, and to look over when I please, without having any apprehensions
of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character. I may also
enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond, faithful, and
unalterable affection, whenever you visit your favorite bower, unless,
indeed, it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the
lips of a poor workingman, clad in a blouse and cap." A faint cry of
mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine, who
almost instantly said, in a saddened tone, as though some envious cloud
darkened the joy which illumined her heart, "Alas, no, Maximilian, this
must not be, for many reasons. We should presume too much on our
own strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led astray by our blind
confidence in each other's prudence."</p>

<p id="id04769">"How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear
Valentine? Have I not, from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance,
schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas? And you
have, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor. When you spoke
to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger,
I placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other
reward than the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since,
by word or look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from
the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you?
You told me, my dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. d'Epinay,
and that your father was resolved upon completing the match, and that
from his will there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known
to change a determination once formed. I kept in the background, as you
wished, and waited, not for the decision of your heart or my own, but
hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf, and
order events in our favor. But what cared I for delays or difficulties,
Valentine, as long as you confessed that you loved me, and took pity
on me? If you will only repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure
anything."</p>

<p id="id04770">"Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and
which renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently
ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my
mother-in-law, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be,
as I now am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these
meetings, so fraught with danger to both."</p>

<p id="id04771">"I will not admit that word," returned the young man; "it is at once
cruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than
myself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to
time, Valentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or
elsewhere—have I not obeyed? And since I found means to enter this
enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate—to be
close to you without really seeing you—have I ever asked so much as to
touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but
a trifle to one of my youth and strength? Never has a complaint or a
murmur escaped me. I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any
knight of olden times. Come, come, dearest Valentine, confess that what
I say is true, lest I be tempted to call you unjust."</p>

<p id="id04772">"It is true," said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender
fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted Maximilian
to press his lips to them, "and you are a true and faithful friend; but
still you acted from motives of self-interest, my dear Maximilian,
for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an
opposite spirit all would have been ended between us. You promised to
bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother. For I have no friend
but yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my father,
harassed and persecuted by my mother-in-law, and left to the sole
companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered hand
can no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone,
although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for
his poor grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as
a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my only
friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed, Maximilian, I
am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out of pity."</p>

<p id="id04773">"Valentine," replied the young man, deeply affected, "I will not say
you are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister and
brother-in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no
manner resembling what I feel for you. When I think of you my heart
beats fast, the blood burns in my veins, and I can hardly breathe; but
I solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor, this fervor and
intensity of feeling, until you yourself shall require me to render
them available in serving or assisting you. M. Franz is not expected to
return home for a year to come, I am told; in that time many favorable
and unforeseen chances may befriend us. Let us, then, hope for the best;
hope is so sweet a comforter. Meanwhile, Valentine, while reproaching me
with selfishness, think a little what you have been to me—the beautiful
but cold resemblance of a marble Venus. What promise of future
reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience I have
evinced?—none whatever. What granted me?—scarcely more. You tell me of
M. Franz d'Epinay, your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the idea of
being his wife; but tell me, Valentine, is there no other sorrow in your
heart? You see me devoted to you, body and soul, my life and each warm
drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service; you
know full well that my existence is bound up in yours—that were I to
lose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery; yet you
speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another!
Oh, Valentine, were I in your place, and did I feel conscious, as you
do, of being worshipped, adored, with such a love as mine, a hundred
times at least should I have passed my hand between these iron bars, and
said, 'Take this hand, dearest Maximilian, and believe that, living
or dead, I am yours—yours only, and forever!'" The poor girl made no
reply, but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears. A rapid
change took place in the young man's feelings. "Dearest, dearest
Valentine," exclaimed he, "forgive me if I have offended you, and forget
the words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain."</p>

<p id="id04774">"No, Maximilian, I am not offended," answered she, "but do you not see
what a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an outcast in
my father's house, where even he is seldom seen; whose will has been
thwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years, beneath the
iron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and persecuted,
day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has cared for,
even observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word on the
subject save to yourself. Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I am
surrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case. The
general remark is, 'Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a
character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do
on their daughters. What though she has lost her own mother at a tender
age, she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de
Villefort.' The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from
utter indifference, while my mother-in-law detests me with a hatred so
much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile."</p>

<p id="id04775">"Hate you, sweet Valentine," exclaimed the young man; "how is it
possible for any one to do that?"</p>

<p id="id04776">"Alas," replied the weeping girl, "I am obliged to own that my
mother-in-law's aversion to me arises from a very natural source—her
overweening love for her own child, my brother Edward."</p>

<p id="id04777">"But why should it?"</p>

<p id="id04778">"I do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters into
our present conversation, I will just say this much—that her extreme
dislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me the
fortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than
doubled at the death of M. and Mme. de Saint-Meran, whose sole heiress
I am. Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own, and hates me for being
so richly endowed. Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of this
wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father's love. God
knows, I would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me
a happy and affectionate home."</p>

<p id="id04779">"Poor Valentine!"</p>

<p id="id04780">"I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage, yet at the
same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the
restraint in which I am held, lest I fall utterly helpless. Then, too,
my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity;
protected as he is by his high position and firmly established
reputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose him;
he is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a word.
Dear Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt
to resist my father's commands it is more on your account than my own."</p>

<p id="id04781">"But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,—why
picture so gloomy a future?"</p>

<p id="id04782">"Because I judge it from the past."</p>

<p id="id04783">"Still, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what
is termed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons,
not altogether so much beneath your alliance. The days when such
distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in
France, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with
those of the empire. The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with
the nobility of the cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class; and
certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as
well as certain. My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered, and
the memory of my late father is respected in our country, Valentine, as
that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city; I say our
country, because you were born not far from Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id04784">"Don't speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word
brings back my mother to my recollection—my angel mother, who died too
soon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her
child during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I
fondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were
still living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would
tell her that I loved you, and she would protect us."</p>

<p id="id04785">"I fear, Valentine," replied the lover, "that were she living I should
never have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been
too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me."</p>

<p id="id04786">"Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian," cried Valentine; "but there
is one thing I wish to know."</p>

<p id="id04787">"And what is that?" inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine
hesitated.</p>

<p id="id04788">"Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers
dwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?"</p>

<p id="id04789">"Not that I am aware of," replied the young man, "unless, indeed, any
ill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties—your
father was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine
was wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any other
difference between them. But why do you ask?"</p>

<p id="id04790">"I will tell you," replied the young girl, "for it is but right you
should know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of the
Legion of honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting with my
grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also—you recollect M.
Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses ran away with
my mother-in-law and little brother, and very nearly killed them? While
the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of
Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my grandfather; but
when I came to the paragraph about you, although I had done nothing else
but read it over to myself all the morning (you know you had told me all
about it the previous evening), I felt so happy, and yet so nervous, at
the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before so many people, that
I really think I should have passed it over, but for the fear that my
doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence; so I
summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly and as steadily as I
could."</p>

<p id="id04791">"Dear Valentine!"</p>

<p id="id04792">"Well, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of your
name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, I was
so persuaded that every one must be as much affected as myself by the
utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father start,
and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must have
been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too."</p>

<p id="id04793">"'Morrel, Morrel,' cried my father, 'stop a bit;' then knitting his
brows into a deep frown, he added, 'surely this cannot be one of the
Morrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from
their violent Bonapartism—I mean about the year 1815.'—'Yes,' replied
M. Danglars, 'I believe he is the son of the old shipowner.'"</p>

<p id="id04794">"Indeed," answered Maximilian; "and what did your father say then,<br/>

Valentine?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id04795">"Oh, such a dreadful thing, that I don't dare to tell you."</p>

<p id="id04796">"Always tell me everything," said Maximilian with a smile.</p>

<p id="id04797">"'Ah,' continued my father, still frowning, 'their idolized emperor
treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them 'food for powder,'
which was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted to see
that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with
all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish
the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it would be
an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain. Though it certainly
does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized
country.'"</p>

<p id="id04798">"Brutal politics, I must confess." said Maximilian; "but don't attach
any serious importance, dear, to what your father said. My father was
not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk. 'Why,' said he, 'does
not the emperor, who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of
improving the art of war, organize a regiment of lawyers, judges and
legal practitioners, sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could
maintain, and using them to save better men?' You see, my dear, that
for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much
to choose between the language of either party. But what did M. Danglars
say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?"</p>

<p id="id04799">"Oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to
himself—half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up
and took his leave; then, for the first time, I observed the agitation
of my grandfather, and I must tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only
person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame. And I
suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence
(for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man,
without the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong
impression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him
to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that
depreciating manner."</p>

<p id="id04800">"The name of M. Noirtier," interposed Maximilian, "is celebrated
throughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may
or may not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every
Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the
Bourbons."</p>

<p id="id04801">"Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most
strange—the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have
been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics?
But to resume my story; I turned towards my grandfather, as though to
question him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively
at the newspaper I had been reading. 'What is the matter, dear
grandfather?' said I, 'are you pleased?' He gave me a sign in the
affirmative. 'With what my father said just now?' He returned a sign in
the negative. 'Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said?' Another sign in
the negative. 'Oh, then, you were glad to hear that M. Morrel (I didn't
dare to say Maximilian) had been made an officer of the Legion of
Honor?' He signified assent; only think of the poor old man's being so
pleased to think that you, who were a perfect stranger to him, had been
made an officer of the Legion of Honor! Perhaps it was a mere whim on
his part, for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but I love
him for showing so much interest in you."</p>

<p id="id04802">"How singular," murmured Maximilian; "your father hates me, while your
grandfather, on the contrary—What strange feelings are aroused by
politics."</p>

<p id="id04803">"Hush," cried Valentine, suddenly; "some one is coming!" Maximilian
leaped at one bound into his crop of lucerne, which he began to pull up
in the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in weeding
it.</p>

<p id="id04804">"Mademoiselle, mademoiselle!" exclaimed a voice from behind the trees.
"Madame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the
drawing-room."</p>

<p id="id04805">"A visitor?" inquired Valentine, much agitated; "who is it?"</p>

<p id="id04806">"Some grand personage—a prince I believe they said—the Count of Monte<br/>

Cristo."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id04807">"I will come directly," cried Valentine aloud. The name of Monte Cristo
sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the
iron gate, to whom Valentine's "I am coming" was the customary signal
of farewell. "Now, then," said Maximilian, leaning on the handle of his
spade, "I would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the
Count of Monte Cristo is acquainted with M. de Villefort."</p>

<h3 id="id04808" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 52. Toxicology.</h3>

<p id="id04809">It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame
de Villefort's for the purpose of returning the procureur's visit,
and at his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in
confusion. Madame de Villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when
the count was announced, desired that her son might be brought thither
instantly to renew his thanks to the count; and Edward, who heard this
great personage talked of for two whole days, made all possible haste to
come to him, not from obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of
gratitude to the count, but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance
remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent
speeches which made his mother say,—"Oh, that naughty child! But I
can't be severe with him, he is really so bright."</p>

<p id="id04810">After the usual civilities, the count inquired after M. de Villefort.
"My husband dines with the chancellor," replied the young lady; "he has
just gone, and I am sure he'll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the
pleasure of seeing you before he went." Two visitors who were there
when the count arrived, having gazed at him with all their eyes, retired
after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity
requires. "What is your sister Valentine doing?" inquired Madame de
Villefort of Edward; "tell some one to bid her come here, that I may
have the honor of introducing her to the count."</p>

<p id="id04811">"You have a daughter, then, madame?" inquired the count; "very young, I
presume?"</p>

<p id="id04812">"The daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage," replied the
young wife, "a fine well-grown girl."</p>

<p id="id04813">"But melancholy," interrupted Master Edward, snatching the feathers out
of the tail of a splendid parroquet that was screaming on its gilded
perch, in order to make a plume for his hat. Madame de Villefort merely
cried,—"Be still, Edward!" She then added,—"This young madcap is,
however, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes what he has heard me
say with pain a hundred times; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is, in
spite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy disposition and
taciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of her beauty. But
what detains her? Go, Edward, and see."</p>

<p id="id04814">"Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found."</p>

<p id="id04815">"And where are they looking for her?"</p>

<p id="id04816">"With grandpapa Noirtier."</p>

<p id="id04817">"And do you think she is not there?"</p>

<p id="id04818">"No, no, no, no, no, she is not there," replied Edward, singing his
words.</p>

<p id="id04819">"And where is she, then? If you know, why don't you tell?"</p>

<p id="id04820">"She is under the big chestnut-tree," replied the spoiled brat, as he
gave, in spite of his mother's commands, live flies to the parrot, which
seemed keenly to relish such fare. Madame de Villefort stretched out her
hand to ring, intending to direct her waiting-maid to the spot where she
would find Valentine, when the young lady herself entered the
apartment. She appeared much dejected; and any person who considered her
attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes.</p>

<p id="id04821">Valentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented
to our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and graceful
girl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and that
reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother.
Her white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks tinted with
varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so
poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan. She
entered the apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of
whom she had already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish
awkwardness, or even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that
redoubled the count's attention. He rose to return the salutation.
"Mademoiselle de Villefort, my daughter-in-law," said Madame de
Villefort to Monte Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and motioning
towards Valentine with her hand. "And M. de Monte Cristo, King of China,
Emperor of Cochin-China," said the young imp, looking slyly towards his
sister.</p>

<p id="id04822">Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly
angry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward;
but the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy
complacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy
and enthusiasm.</p>

<p id="id04823">"But, madame," replied the count, continuing the conversation, and
looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine, "have I not
already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before? I
could not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and
as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light
thrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark."</p>

<p id="id04824">"I do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very
fond of society, and we very seldom go out," said the young lady.</p>

<p id="id04825">"Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself,
madame, or this charming little merry boy. Besides, the Parisian world
is entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been in
Paris but very few days. No,—but, perhaps, you will permit me to call
to mind—stay!" The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect
his thoughts. "No—it was somewhere—away from here—it was—I do not
know—but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely
sky and some religious fete; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her
hand, the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden,
and you, madame, were under the trellis of some arbor. Pray come to my
aid, madame; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory?"</p>

<p id="id04826">"No, indeed," replied Madame de Villefort; "and yet it appears to me,
sir, that if I had met you anywhere, the recollection of you must have
been imprinted on my memory."</p>

<p id="id04827">"Perhaps the count saw us in Italy," said Valentine timidly.</p>

<p id="id04828">"Yes, in Italy; it was in Italy most probably," replied Monte Cristo;
"you have travelled then in Italy, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p id="id04829">"Yes; madame and I were there two years ago. The doctors, anxious for
my lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples. We went by Bologna, Perugia,
and Rome."</p>

<p id="id04830">"Ah, yes—true, mademoiselle," exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple
explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought. "It was
at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day, in the garden of the Hotel des Postes,
when chance brought us together; you, Madame de Villefort, and her son;
I now remember having had the honor of meeting you."</p>

<p id="id04831">"I perfectly well remember Perugia, sir, and the Hotel des Postes, and
the festival of which you speak," said Madame de Villefort, "but in vain
do I tax my memory, of whose treachery I am ashamed, for I really do not
recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before."</p>

<p id="id04832">"It is strange, but neither do I recollect meeting with you," observed<br/>

Valentine, raising her beautiful eyes to the count.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id04833">"But I remember it perfectly," interposed the darling Edward.</p>

<p id="id04834">"I will assist your memory, madame," continued the count; "the day had
been burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which were delayed in
consequence of the festival. Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of
the garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock."</p>

<p id="id04835">"And I caught it, mamma, don't you remember?" interposed Edward, "and I
pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail."</p>

<p id="id04836">"You, madame, remained under the arbor; do you not remember, that while
you were seated on a stone bench, and while, as I told you, Mademoiselle
de Villefort and your young son were absent, you conversed for a
considerable time with somebody?"</p>

<p id="id04837">"Yes, in truth, yes," answered the young lady, turning very red, "I do
remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle; he
was a medical man, I think."</p>

<p id="id04838">"Precisely so, madame; this man was myself; for a fortnight I had been
at that hotel, during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of
a fever, and my landlord of the jaundice, so that I really acquired a
reputation as a skilful physician. We discoursed a long time, madame, on
different subjects; of Perugino, of Raffaelle, of manners, customs, of
the famous aquatofana, of which they had told you, I think you said,
that certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret."</p>

<p id="id04839">"Yes, true," replied Madame de Villefort, somewhat uneasily, "I remember
now."</p>

<p id="id04840">"I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed,
madame," continued the count with perfect calmness; "but I perfectly
remember that, falling into the error which others had entertained
respecting me, you consulted me as to the health of Mademoiselle de
Villefort."</p>

<p id="id04841">"Yes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man," said Madame de<br/>

Villefort, "since you had cured the sick."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id04842">"Moliere or Beaumarchais would reply to you, madame, that it was
precisely because I was not, that I had cured my patients; for myself,
I am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the
natural sciences somewhat deeply, but still only as an amateur, you
understand."—At this moment the clock struck six. "It is six o'clock,"
said Madame de Villefort, evidently agitated. "Valentine, will you not
go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner?" Valentine rose, and
saluting the count, left the apartment without speaking.</p>

<p id="id04843">"Oh, madame," said the count, when Valentine had left the room, "was it
on my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away?"</p>

<p id="id04844">"By no means," replied the young lady quickly; "but this is the hour
when we usually give M. Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his
pitiful existence. You are aware, sir, of the deplorable condition of my
husband's father?"</p>

<p id="id04845">"Yes, madame, M. de Villefort spoke of it to me—a paralysis, I think."</p>

<p id="id04846">"Alas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind alone
is still active in this human machine, and that is faint and flickering,
like the light of a lamp about to expire. But excuse me, sir, for
talking of our domestic misfortunes; I interrupted you at the moment
when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist."</p>
