<p id="id04088">"She only speaks Romaic."</p>

<p id="id04089">"That is different."</p>

<p id="id04090">"But at least we shall see her," said Beauchamp, "or do you keep eunuchs
as well as mutes?"</p>

<p id="id04091">"Oh, no," replied Monte Cristo; "I do not carry brutalism so far. Every
one who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me will
no longer have any need of me or any one else; it is for that reason,
perhaps, that they do not quit me." They had long since passed to
dessert and cigars.</p>

<p id="id04092">"My dear Albert," said Debray, rising, "it is half-past two. Your
guest is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the worst
sometimes. I must return to the minister's. I will tell him of the
count, and we shall soon know who he is."</p>

<p id="id04093">"Take care," returned Albert; "no one has been able to accomplish that."</p>

<p id="id04094">"Oh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are almost
always spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty
thousand francs to spend for this purpose."</p>

<p id="id04095">"And when you know, will you tell me?"</p>

<p id="id04096">"I promise you. Au revoir, Albert. Gentlemen, good morning."</p>

<p id="id04097">As he left the room, Debray called out loudly, "My carriage."</p>

<p id="id04098">"Bravo," said Beauchamp to Albert; "I shall not go to the Chamber, but I
have something better to offer my readers than a speech of M. Danglars."</p>

<p id="id04099">"For heaven's sake, Beauchamp," returned Morcerf, "do not deprive me of
the merit of introducing him everywhere. Is he not peculiar?"</p>

<p id="id04100">"He is more than that," replied Chateau-Renaud; "he is one of the most
extraordinary men I ever saw in my life. Are you coming, Morrel?"</p>

<p id="id04101">"Directly I have given my card to the count, who has promised to pay us
a visit at Rue Meslay, No. 14."</p>

<p id="id04102">"Be sure I shall not fail to do so," returned the count, bowing. And
Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de Chateau-Renaud,
leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf.</p>

<h3 id="id04103" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 41. The Presentation.</h3>

<p id="id04104">When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo, "My dear count,"
said he, "allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you
a specimen of a bachelor's apartment. You, who are accustomed to the
palaces of Italy, can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square
feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can live. As
we pass from one room to another, I will open the windows to let you
breathe." Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfast-room and the salon
on the ground-floor. Albert led him first to his atelier, which was, as
we have said, his favorite apartment. Monte Cristo quickly appreciated
all that Albert had collected here&#8212;old cabinets, Japanese porcelain,
Oriental stuffs, Venetian glass, arms from all parts of the
world&#8212;everything was familiar to him; and at the first glance he
recognized their date, their country, and their origin. Morcerf had
expected he should be the guide; on the contrary, it was he who, under
the count's guidance, followed a course of archaeology, mineralogy, and
natural history. They descended to the first floor; Albert led his guest
into the salon. The salon was filled with the works of modern artists;
there were landscapes by Dupre, with their long reeds and tall trees,
their lowing oxen and marvellous skies; Delacroix's Arabian cavaliers,
with their long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked
arms, their horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their
riders contended fiercely with their maces; aquarelles of Boulanger,
representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist
the rival of the poet; there were paintings by Diaz, who makes his
flowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the
sun; designs by Decamp, as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa,
but more poetic; pastels by Giraud and Muller, representing children
like angels and women with the features of a virgin; sketches torn from
the album of Dauzats' "Travels in the East," that had been made in a few
seconds on the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a mosque&#8212;in a
word, all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the
art lost and gone with ages long since past.</p>

<p id="id04105">Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the
traveller, but, to his great surprise, the latter, without seeking
for the signatures, many of which, indeed, were only initials, named
instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy
to see that each name was not only known to him, but that each style
associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him. From the
salon they passed into the bed-chamber; it was a model of taste and
simple elegance. A single portrait, signed by Leopold Robert, shone in
its carved and gilded frame. This portrait attracted the Count of Monte
Cristo's attention, for he made three rapid steps in the chamber, and
stopped suddenly before it. It was the portrait of a young woman of five
or six and twenty, with a dark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes,
veiled beneath long lashes. She wore the picturesque costume of the
Catalan fisherwomen, a red and black bodice, and golden pins in her
hair. She was looking at the sea, and her form was outlined on the blue
ocean and sky. The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not
perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count's visage, or the
nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders. Silence prevailed for an
instant, during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the picture.</p>

<p id="id04106">"You have there a most charming mistress, viscount," said the count in
a perfectly calm tone; "and this costume&#8212;a ball costume,
doubtless&#8212;becomes her admirably."</p>

<p id="id04107">"Ah, monsieur," returned Albert, "I would never forgive you this mistake
if you had seen another picture beside this. You do not know my mother;
she it is whom you see here. She had her portrait painted thus six
or eight years ago. This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and the
resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same
as she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait painted during
the count's absence. She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable
surprise; but, strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my
father, and the value of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the
best works of Leopold Robert, could not overcome his dislike to it.
It is true, between ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most
assiduous peers at the Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a
most mediocre amateur of art. It is different with my mother, who paints
exceedingly well, and who, unwilling to part with so valuable a picture,
gave it to me to put here, where it would be less likely to displease
M. de Morcerf, whose portrait, by Gros, I will also show you. Excuse my
talking of family matters, but as I shall have the honor of introducing
you to the count, I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions
to this picture. The picture seems to have a malign influence, for my
mother rarely comes here without looking at it, and still more rarely
does she look at it without weeping. This disagreement is the only one
that has ever taken place between the count and countess, who are still
as much united, although married more than twenty years, as on the first
day of their wedding."</p>

<p id="id04108">Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert, as if to seek a hidden meaning
in his words, but it was evident the young man uttered them in the
simplicity of his heart. "Now," said Albert, "that you have seen all my
treasures, allow me to offer them to you, unworthy as they are. Consider
yourself as in your own house, and to put yourself still more at your
ease, pray accompany me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf, he whom I
wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me, and to whom
I announced your promised visit, and I may say that both the count and
countess anxiously desire to thank you in person. You are somewhat blase
I know, and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor,
who has seen so many others. However, accept what I propose to you as
an initiation into Parisian life&#8212;a life of politeness, visiting,
and introductions." Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer; he
accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret, as one of
those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty.
Albert summoned his servant, and ordered him to acquaint M. and Madame
de Morcerf of the arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo. Albert followed
him with the count. When they arrived at the ante-chamber, above the
door was visible a shield, which, by its rich ornaments and its harmony
with the rest of the furniture, indicated the importance the owner
attached to this blazon. Monte Cristo stopped and examined it
attentively.</p>

<p id="id04109">"Azure seven merlets, or, placed bender," said he. "These are,
doubtless, your family arms? Except the knowledge of blazons, that
enables me to decipher them, I am very ignorant of heraldry&#8212;I, a count
of a fresh creation, fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery
of St. Stephen, and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been
told that when you travel much it is necessary. Besides, you must have
something on the panels of your carriage, to escape being searched by
the custom-house officers. Excuse my putting such a question to you."</p>

<p id="id04110">"It is not indiscreet," returned Morcerf, with the simplicity of
conviction. "You have guessed rightly. These are our arms, that is,
those of my father, but they are, as you see, joined to another shield,
which has gules, a silver tower, which are my mother's. By her side I am
Spanish, but the family of Morcerf is French, and, I have heard, one of
the oldest of the south of France."</p>

<p id="id04111">"Yes," replied Monte Cristo "these blazons prove that. Almost all the
armed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their arms either a
cross, in honor of their mission, or birds of passage, in sign of
the long voyage they were about to undertake, and which they hoped to
accomplish on the wings of faith. One of your ancestors had joined the
Crusades, and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis, that makes you
mount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient."</p>

<p id="id04112">"It is possible," said Morcerf; "my father has in his study a
genealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which I made
commentaries that would have greatly edified Hozier and Jaucourt. At
present I no longer think of it, and yet I must tell you that we are
beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our
popular government."</p>

<p id="id04113">"Well, then, your government would do well to choose from the past
something better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments,
and which have no heraldic meaning whatever. As for you, viscount,"
continued Monte Cristo to Morcerf, "you are more fortunate than the
government, for your arms are really beautiful, and speak to the
imagination. Yes, you are at once from Provence and Spain; that
explains, if the portrait you showed me be like, the dark hue I so much
admired on the visage of the noble Catalan." It would have required the
penetration of Oedipus or the Sphinx to have divined the irony the count
concealed beneath these words, apparently uttered with the greatest
politeness. Morcerf thanked him with a smile, and pushed open the door
above which were his arms, and which, as we have said, opened into the
salon. In the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait.
It was that of a man, from five to eight and thirty, in the uniform of
a general officer, wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion, that
indicates superior rank, the ribbon of the Legion of Honor around his
neck, which showed he was a commander, and on the right breast, the star
of a grand officer of the order of the Saviour, and on the left that
of the grand cross of Charles III., which proved that the person
represented by the picture had served in the wars of Greece and Spain,
or, what was just the same thing as regarded decorations, had fulfilled
some diplomatic mission in the two countries.</p>

<p id="id04114">Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care
than he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he
found himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person. He was a man
of forty to forty-five years, but he seemed at least fifty, and his
black mustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white
hair, which was cut short, in the military fashion. He was dressed in
plain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different
orders to which he belonged. He entered with a tolerably dignified step,
and some little haste. Monte Cristo saw him advance towards him without
making a single step. It seemed as if his feet were rooted to the
ground, and his eyes on the Count of Morcerf. "Father," said the young
man, "I have the honor of presenting to you the Count of Monte Cristo,
the generous friend whom I had the good fortune to meet in the critical
situation of which I have told you."</p>

<p id="id04115">"You are most welcome, monsieur," said the Count of Morcerf, saluting
Monte Cristo with a smile, "and monsieur has rendered our house, in
preserving its only heir, a service which insures him our eternal
gratitude." As he said these words, the count of Morcerf pointed to a
chair, while he seated himself in another opposite the window.</p>

<p id="id04116">Monte Cristo, in taking the seat Morcerf offered him, placed himself in
such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet
curtains, and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a
whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted
there. "The countess," said Morcerf, "was at her toilet when she was
informed of the visit she was about to receive. She will, however, be in
the salon in ten minutes."</p>

<p id="id04117">"It is a great honor to me," returned Monte Cristo, "to be thus, on the
first day of my arrival in Paris, brought in contact with a man whose
merit equals his reputation, and to whom fortune has for once been
equitable, but has she not still on the plains of Metidja, or in the
mountains of Atlas, a marshal's staff to offer you?"</p>

<p id="id04118">"Oh," replied Morcerf, reddening slightly, "I have left the service,
monsieur. Made a peer at the Restoration, I served through the first
campaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont. I could, therefore,
expect a higher rank, and who knows what might have happened had the
elder branch remained on the throne? But the Revolution of July was, it
seems, sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful, and it
was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period. I
tendered my resignation, for when you have gained your epaulets on the
battle-field, you do not know how to manoeuvre on the slippery grounds
of the salons. I have hung up my sword, and cast myself into politics.
I have devoted myself to industry; I study the useful arts. During the
twenty years I served, I often wished to do so, but I had not the time."</p>

<p id="id04119">"These are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other,"
returned Monte Cristo. "A gentleman of high birth, possessor of an
ample fortune, you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure
soldier, step by step&#8212;this is uncommon; then become general, peer of
France, commander of the Legion of Honor, you consent to again commence
a second apprenticeship, without any other hope or any other desire than
that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures; this, indeed,
is praiseworthy,&#8212;nay, more, it is sublime." Albert looked on and
listened with astonishment; he was not used to see Monte Cristo give
vent to such bursts of enthusiasm. "Alas," continued the stranger,
doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered Morcerf's brow, "we
do not act thus in Italy; we grow according to our race and our species,
and we pursue the same lines, and often the same uselessness, all our
lives."</p>

<p id="id04120">"But, monsieur," said the Count of Morcerf, "for a man of your merit,
Italy is not a country, and France opens her arms to receive you;
respond to her call. France will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful. She
treats her children ill, but she always welcomes strangers."</p>

<p id="id04121">"Ah, father," said Albert with a smile, "it is evident you do not know
the Count of Monte Cristo; he despises all honors, and contents himself
with those written on his passport."</p>

<p id="id04122">"That is the most just remark," replied the stranger, "I ever heard made
concerning myself."</p>

<p id="id04123">"You have been free to choose your career," observed the Count of
Morcerf, with a sigh; "and you have chosen the path strewed with
flowers."</p>

<p id="id04124">"Precisely, monsieur," replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles
that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze.</p>

<p id="id04125">"If I did not fear to fatigue you," said the general, evidently charmed
with the count's manners, "I would have taken you to the Chamber;
there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern
senators."</p>

<p id="id04126">"I shall be most grateful, monsieur, if you will, at some future time,
renew your offer, but I have been flattered with the hope of being
introduced to the countess, and I will therefore wait."</p>

<p id="id04127">"Ah, here is my mother," cried the viscount. Monte Cristo, turned round
hastily, and saw Madame de Morcerf at the entrance of the salon, at
the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered, pale and
motionless; when Monte Cristo turned round, she let fall her arm, which
for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door-post.
She had been there some moments, and had heard the last words of the
visitor. The latter rose and bowed to the countess, who inclined herself
without speaking. "Ah, good heavens, madame," said the count, "are you
ill, or is it the heat of the room that affects you?"</p>

<p id="id04128">"Are you ill, mother?" cried the viscount, springing towards her.</p>

<p id="id04129">She thanked them both with a smile. "No," returned she, "but I feel
some emotion on seeing, for the first time, the man without whose
intervention we should have been in tears and desolation. Monsieur,"
continued the countess, advancing with the majesty of a queen, "I owe to
you the life of my son, and for this I bless you. Now, I thank you
for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of
thanking you as I have blessed you, from the bottom of my heart."
The count bowed again, but lower than before; He was even paler than
Mercedes. "Madame," said he, "the count and yourself recompense too
generously a simple action. To save a man, to spare a father's feelings,
or a mother's sensibility, is not to do a good action, but a simple deed
of humanity." At these words, uttered with the most exquisite sweetness
and politeness, Madame de Morcerf replied. "It is very fortunate for my
son, monsieur, that he found such a friend, and I thank God that things
are thus." And Mercedes raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent
an expression of gratitude, that the count fancied he saw tears in them.
M. de Morcerf approached her. "Madame," said he. "I have already made my
excuses to the count for quitting him, and I pray you to do so also. The
sitting commences at two; it is now three, and I am to speak."</p>

<p id="id04130">"Go, then, and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your
absence," replied the countess, with the same tone of deep feeling.
"Monsieur," continued she, turning to Monte Cristo, "will you do us the
honor of passing the rest of the day with us?"</p>

<p id="id04131">"Believe me, madame, I feel most grateful for your kindness, but I
got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning, and I am
ignorant how I am installed in Paris, which I scarcely know; this is but
a trifling inquietude, I know, but one that may be appreciated."</p>

<p id="id04132">"We shall have the pleasure another time," said the countess; "you
promise that?" Monte Cristo inclined himself without answering, but
the gesture might pass for assent. "I will not detain you, monsieur,"
continued the countess; "I would not have our gratitude become
indiscreet or importunate."</p>

<p id="id04133">"My dear Count," said Albert, "I will endeavor to return your politeness
at Rome, and place my coupe at your disposal until your own be ready."</p>

<p id="id04134">"A thousand thanks for your kindness, viscount," returned the Count of
Monte Cristo "but I suppose that M. Bertuccio has suitably employed the
four hours and a half I have given him, and that I shall find a carriage
of some sort ready at the door." Albert was used to the count's
manner of proceeding; he knew that, like Nero, he was in search of the
impossible, and nothing astonished him, but wishing to judge with his
own eyes how far the count's orders had been executed, he accompanied
him to the door of the house. Monte Cristo was not deceived. As soon as
he appeared in the Count of Morcerf's ante-chamber, a footman, the
same who at Rome had brought the count's card to the two young men, and
announced his visit, sprang into the vestibule, and when he arrived at
the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him. It
was a coupe of Koller's building, and with horses and harness for which
Drake had, to the knowledge of all the lions of Paris, refused on
the previous day seven hundred guineas. "Monsieur," said the count to
Albert, "I do not ask you to accompany me to my house, as I can only
show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry, and I have, as you know, a
reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise. Give me,
therefore, one more day before I invite you; I shall then be certain not
to fail in my hospitality."</p>

<p id="id04135">"If you ask me for a day, count, I know what to anticipate; it will not
be a house I shall see, but a palace. You have decidedly some genius at
your control."</p>

<p id="id04136">"Ma foi, spread that idea," replied the Count of Monte Cristo, putting
his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid carriage, "and that
will be worth something to me among the ladies." As he spoke, he sprang
into the vehicle, the door was closed, but not so rapidly that Monte
Cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which
stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left Madame de
Morcerf. When Albert returned to his mother, he found her in the boudoir
reclining in a large velvet arm-chair, the whole room so obscure that
only the shining spangle, fastened here and there to the drapery, and
the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures, showed with some
degree of brightness in the gloom. Albert could not see the face of the
countess, as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head,
and which fell over her features in misty folds, but it seemed to him as
though her voice had altered. He could distinguish amid the perfumes of
the roses and heliotropes in the flower-stands, the sharp and fragrant
odor of volatile salts, and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the
mantle-piece the countess's smelling-bottle, taken from its shagreen
case, and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness, as he entered,&#8212;"My dear
mother, have you been ill during my absence?"</p>

<p id="id04137">"No, no, Albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and orange-flowers
throw out at first, before one is used to them, such violent perfumes."</p>

<p id="id04138">"Then, my dear mother," said Albert, putting his hand to the bell, "they
must be taken into the ante-chamber. You are really ill, and just now
were so pale as you came into the room"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04139">"Was I pale, Albert?"</p>

<p id="id04140">"Yes; a pallor that suits you admirably, mother, but which did not the
less alarm my father and myself."</p>

<p id="id04141">"Did your father speak of it?" inquired Mercedes eagerly.</p>

<p id="id04142">"No, madame; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you?"</p>

<p id="id04143">"Yes, I do remember," replied the countess. A servant entered, summoned
by Albert's ring of the bell. "Take these flowers into the anteroom or
dressing-room," said the viscount; "they make the countess ill." The
footman obeyed his orders. A long pause ensued, which lasted until all
the flowers were removed. "What is this name of Monte Cristo?" inquired
the countess, when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers,
"is it a family name, or the name of the estate, or a simple title?"</p>

<p id="id04144">"I believe, mother, it is merely a title. The count purchased an island
in the Tuscan archipelago, and, as he told you to-day, has founded
a commandery. You know the same thing was done for Saint Stephen of
Florence, Saint George, Constantinian of Parma, and even for the Order
of Malta. Except this, he has no pretension to nobility, and calls
himself a chance count, although the general opinion at Rome is that the
count is a man of very high distinction."</p>

<p id="id04145">"His manners are admirable," said the countess, "at least, as far as I
could judge in the few minutes he remained here."</p>

<p id="id04146">"They are perfect mother, so perfect, that they surpass by far all I
have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities
of Europe&#8212;the English, the Spanish, and the German." The countess
paused a moment; then, after a slight hesitation, she resumed,&#8212;"You
have seen, my dear Albert&#8212;I ask the question as a mother&#8212;you have
seen M. de Monte Cristo in his house, you are quicksighted, have much
knowledge of the world, more tact than is usual at your age, do you
think the count is really what he appears to be?"</p>

<p id="id04147">"What does he appear to be?"</p>

<p id="id04148">"Why, you have just said,&#8212;a man of high distinction."</p>

<p id="id04149">"I told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such."</p>

<p id="id04150">"But what is your own opinion, Albert?"</p>

<p id="id04151">"I must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion respecting
him, but I think him a Maltese."</p>

<p id="id04152">"I do not ask you of his origin but what he is."</p>

<p id="id04153">"Ah, what he is; that is quite another thing. I have seen so many
remarkable things in him, that if you would have me really say what I
think, I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byron's
heroes, whom misery has marked with a fatal brand; some Manfred, some
Lara, some Werner, one of those wrecks, as it were, of some ancient
family, who, disinherited of their patrimony, have achieved one by the
force of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws
of society."</p>

<p id="id04154">"You say"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04155">"I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the Mediterranean,
without inhabitants or garrison, the resort of smugglers of all nations,
and pirates of every flag. Who knows whether or not these industrious
worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection?"</p>

<p id="id04156">"That is possible," said the countess, reflecting.</p>

<p id="id04157">"Never mind," continued the young man, "smuggler or not, you must agree,
mother dear, as you have seen him, that the Count of Monte Cristo is
a remarkable man, who will have the greatest success in the salons of
Paris. Why, this very morning, in my rooms, he made his entree amongst
us by striking every man of us with amazement, not even excepting
Chateau-Renaud."</p>

<p id="id04158">"And what do you suppose is the count's age?" inquired Mercedes,
evidently attaching great importance to this question.</p>

<p id="id04159">"Thirty-five or thirty-six, mother."</p>

<p id="id04160">"So young,&#8212;it is impossible," said Mercedes, replying at the same time
to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection.</p>

<p id="id04161">"It is the truth, however. Three or four times he has said to me, and
certainly without the slightest premeditation, 'at such a period I was
five years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,' and
I, induced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have
compared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. The age of this
singular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five.
Besides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair,
and his brow, though so pale, is free from wrinkles,&#8212;he is not only
vigorous, but also young." The countess bent her head, as if beneath a
heavy wave of bitter thoughts. "And has this man displayed a friendship
for you, Albert?" she asked with a nervous shudder.</p>

<p id="id04162">"I am inclined to think so."</p>

<p id="id04163">"And&#8212;do&#8212;you&#8212;like&#8212;him?"</p>

<p id="id04164">"Why, he pleases me in spite of Franz d'Epinay, who tries to convince
me that he is a being returned from the other world." The countess
shuddered. "Albert," she said, in a voice which was altered by emotion,
"I have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances. Now you
are a man, and are able to give me advice; yet I repeat to you, Albert,
be prudent."</p>

<p id="id04165">"Why, my dear mother, it is necessary, in order to make your advice turn
to account, that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust.
The count never plays, he only drinks pure water tinged with a little
sherry, and is so rich that he cannot, without intending to laugh at me,
try to borrow money. What, then, have I to fear from him?"</p>

<p id="id04166">"You are right," said the countess, "and my fears are weakness,
especially when directed against a man who has saved your life. How did
your father receive him, Albert? It is necessary that we should be more
than complaisant to the count. M. de Morcerf is sometimes occupied, his
business makes him reflective, and he might, without intending it"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04167">"Nothing could be in better taste than my father's demeanor, madame,"
said Albert; "nay, more, he seemed greatly flattered at two or three
compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with
as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years. Each of these
little tickling arrows must have pleased my father," added Albert with
a laugh. "And thus they parted the best possible friends, and M. de
Morcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the speakers."
The countess made no reply. She fell into so deep a revery that her eyes
gradually closed. The young man, standing up before her, gazed upon
her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with
children whose mothers are still young and handsome. Then, after seeing
her eyes closed, and hearing her breathe gently, he believed she had
dropped asleep, and left the apartment on tiptoe, closing the door after
him with the utmost precaution. "This devil of a fellow," he muttered,
shaking his head; "I said at the time he would create a sensation here,
and I measure his effect by an infallible thermometer. My mother has
noticed him, and he must therefore, perforce, be remarkable." He
went down to the stables, not without some slight annoyance, when
he remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a
"turnout" which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of
connoisseurs. "Most decidedly," said he, "men are not equal, and I must
beg my father to develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers."</p>

<h3 id="id04168" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 42. Monsieur Bertuccio.</h3>

<p id="id04169">Meanwhile the count had arrived at his house; it had taken him six
minutes to perform the distance, but these six minutes were sufficient
to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had
been unable to purchase themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in
order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs
apiece for his horses. The house Ali had chosen, and which was to serve
as a town residence to Monte Cristo, was situated on the right hand as
you ascend the Champs Elysees. A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in
the centre, and masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery
two alleys, like two arms, extended right and left, and formed a
carriage-drive from the iron gates to a double portico, on every step of
which stood a porcelain vase, filled with flowers. This house, isolated
from the rest, had, besides the main entrance, another in the Rue
Ponthieu. Even before the coachman had hailed the concierge, the massy
gates rolled on their hinges&#8212;they had seen the Count coming, and at
Paris, as everywhere else, he was served with the rapidity of lightning.
The coachman entered and traversed the half-circle without slackening
his speed, and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound
on the gravel. The carriage stopped at the left side of the portico, two
men presented themselves at the carriage-window; the one was Ali, who,
smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid
by a mere look from Monte Cristo. The other bowed respectfully,
and offered his arm to assist the count in descending. "Thanks, M.
Bertuccio," said the count, springing lightly up the three steps of the
portico; "and the notary?"</p>

<p id="id04170">"He is in the small salon, excellency," returned Bertuccio.</p>

<p id="id04171">"And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number
of the house?"</p>

<p id="id04172">"Your excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best
engraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The
first card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron
Danglars, Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin, No. 7; the others are on the
mantle-piece of your excellency's bedroom."</p>

<p id="id04173">"Good; what o'clock is it?"</p>

<p id="id04174">"Four o'clock." Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same
French footman who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf's,
and then he passed into the small salon, preceded by Bertuccio,
who showed him the way. "These are but indifferent marbles in this
ante-chamber," said Monte Cristo. "I trust all this will soon be taken
away." Bertuccio bowed. As the steward had said, the notary awaited him
in the small salon. He was a simple-looking lawyer's clerk, elevated to
the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener. "You are the notary
empowered to sell the country house that I wish to purchase, monsieur?"
asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04175">"Yes, count," returned the notary.</p>

<p id="id04176">"Is the deed of sale ready?"</p>

<p id="id04177">"Yes, count."</p>

<p id="id04178">"Have you brought it?"</p>

<p id="id04179">"Here it is."</p>

<p id="id04180">"Very well; and where is this house that I purchase?" asked the count
carelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the notary.
The steward made a gesture that signified, "I do not know." The notary
looked at the count with astonishment. "What!" said he, "does not the
count know where the house he purchases is situated?"</p>

<p id="id04181">"No," returned the count.</p>

<p id="id04182">"The count does not know?"</p>

<p id="id04183">"How should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have never
before been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even set my
foot in France."</p>

<p id="id04184">"Ah, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil." At these
words Bertuccio turned pale. "And where is Auteuil?" asked the count.</p>

<p id="id04185">"Close by here, monsieur," replied the notary&#8212;"a little beyond Passy; a
charming situation, in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne."</p>

<p id="id04186">"So near as that?" said the Count; "but that is not in the country. What
made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M. Bertuccio?"</p>

<p id="id04187">"I," cried the steward with a strange expression. "His excellency
did not charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency will
recollect&#8212;if he will think"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04188">"Ah, true," observed Monte Cristo; "I recollect now. I read the
advertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false title,
'a country house.'"</p>

<p id="id04189">"It is not yet too late," cried Bertuccio, eagerly; "and if your
excellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a better
at Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue."</p>

<p id="id04190">"Oh, no," returned Monte Cristo negligently; "since I have this, I will
keep it."</p>

<p id="id04191">"And you are quite right," said the notary, who feared to lose his fee.
"It is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water and fine trees;
a comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long time, without
reckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet valuable, now that
old things are so much sought after. I suppose the count has the tastes
of the day?"</p>

<p id="id04192">"To be sure," returned Monte Cristo; "it is very convenient, then?"</p>

<p id="id04193">"It is more&#8212;it is magnificent."</p>

<p id="id04194">"Peste, let us not lose such an opportunity," returned Monte Cristo.
"The deed, if you please, Mr. Notary." And he signed it rapidly, after
having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were
specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors.
"Bertuccio," said he, "give fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur." The
steward left the room with a faltering step, and returned with a bundle
of bank-notes, which the notary counted like a man who never gives a
receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there. "And now,"
demanded the count, "are all the forms complied with?"</p>

<p id="id04195">"All, sir."</p>

<p id="id04196">"Have you the keys?"</p>

<p id="id04197">"They are in the hands of the concierge, who takes care of the house,
but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new
possessions."</p>

<p id="id04198">"Very well;" and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary,
which said, "I have no further need of you; you may go."</p>

<p id="id04199">"But," observed the honest notary, "the count is, I think, mistaken; it
is only fifty thousand francs, everything included."</p>

<p id="id04200">"And your fee?"</p>

<p id="id04201">"Is included in this sum."</p>

<p id="id04202">"But have you not come from Auteuil here?"</p>

<p id="id04203">"Yes, certainly."</p>

<p id="id04204">"Well, then, it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of
time and trouble," said the count; and he made a gesture of polite
dismissal. The notary left the room backwards, and bowing down to the
ground; it was the first time he had ever met a similar client. "See
this gentleman out," said the count to Bertuccio. And the steward
followed the notary out of the room. Scarcely was the count alone, when
he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock, and opened it with a
key which he wore round his neck, and which never left him. After having
sought for a few minutes, he stopped at a leaf which had several
notes, and compared them with the deed of sale, which lay on the table.
"'Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28;' it is indeed the same," said he;
"and now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical
terror? However, in an hour I shall know all. Bertuccio!" cried
he, striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong.
"Bertuccio!" The steward appeared at the door. "Monsieur Bertuccio,"
said the count, "did you never tell me that you had travelled in
France?"</p>

<p id="id04205">"In some parts of France&#8212;yes, excellency."</p>

<p id="id04206">"You know the environs of Paris, then?"</p>

<p id="id04207">"No, excellency, no," returned the steward, with a sort of nervous
trembling, which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur in all emotions, rightly
attributed to great disquietude.</p>

<p id="id04208">"It is unfortunate," returned he, "that you have never visited the
environs, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and had you
gone with me, you could have given me some useful information."</p>

<p id="id04209">"To Auteuil!" cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became livid&#8212;"I
go to Auteuil?"</p>

<p id="id04210">"Well, what is there surprising in that? When I live at Auteuil, you
must come there, as you belong to my service." Bertuccio hung down his
head before the imperious look of his master, and remained motionless,
without making any answer. "Why, what has happened to you?&#8212;are you
going to make me ring a second time for the carriage?" asked Monte
Cristo, in the same tone that Louis XIV. pronounced the famous, "I
have been almost obliged to wait." Bertuccio made but one bound to the
ante-chamber, and cried in a hoarse voice&#8212;"His excellency's horses!"
Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the
steward appeared. "Your excellency's carriage is at the door," said he.</p>

<p id="id04211">"Well, take your hat and gloves," returned Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04212">"Am I to accompany you, your excellency?" cried Bertuccio.</p>

<p id="id04213">"Certainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the
house." It was unexampled for a servant of the count's to dare to
dispute an order of his, so the steward, without saying a word, followed
his master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to follow,
which he did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat.</p>

<h3 id="id04214" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 43. The House at Auteuil.</h3>

<p id="id04215">Monte Cristo noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio
signed himself in the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of
the cross in the air with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the
carriage, muttered a short prayer. Any one but a man of exhaustless
thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward's
extraordinary repugnance for the count's projected drive without the
walls; but the Count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this
little journey. In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil; the steward's
emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village. Bertuccio,
crouched in the corner of the carriage, began to examine with a feverish
anxiety every house they passed. "Tell them to stop at Rue de la
Fontaine, No. 28," said the count, fixing his eyes on the steward,
to whom he gave this order. Bertuccio's forehead was covered with
perspiration; however, he obeyed, and, leaning out of the window,
he cried to the coachman,&#8212;"Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28." No. 28 was
situated at the extremity of the village; during the drive night had set
in, and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a
scene on the stage. The carriage stopped, the footman sprang off the
box, and opened the door. "Well," said the count, "you do not get out,
M. Bertuccio&#8212;you are going to stay in the carriage, then? What are
you thinking of this evening?" Bertuccio sprang out, and offered his
shoulder to the count, who, this time, leaned upon it as he descended
the three steps of the carriage. "Knock," said the count, "and announce
me." Bertuccio knocked, the door opened, and the concierge appeared.
"What is it?" asked he.</p>

<p id="id04216">"It is your new master, my good fellow," said the footman. And he held
out to the concierge the notary's order.</p>

<p id="id04217">"The house is sold, then?" demanded the concierge; "and this gentleman
is coming to live here?"</p>

<p id="id04218">"Yes, my friend," returned the count; "and I will endeavor to give you
no cause to regret your old master."</p>

<p id="id04219">"Oh, monsieur," said the concierge, "I shall not have much cause to
regret him, for he came here but seldom; it is five years since he was
here last, and he did well to sell the house, for it did not bring him
in anything at all."</p>

<p id="id04220">"What was the name of your old master?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04221">"The Marquis of Saint-Meran. Ah, I am sure he has not sold the house for
what he gave for it."</p>

<p id="id04222">"The Marquis of Saint-Meran!" returned the count. "The name is not
unknown to me; the Marquis of Saint-Meran!" and he appeared to meditate.</p>

<p id="id04223">"An old gentleman," continued the concierge, "a stanch follower of the
Bourbons; he had an only daughter, who married M. de Villefort, who had
been the king's attorney at Nimes, and afterwards at Versailles." Monte
Cristo glanced at Bertuccio, who became whiter than the wall against
which he leaned to prevent himself from falling. "And is not this
daughter dead?" demanded Monte Cristo; "I fancy I have heard so."</p>

<p id="id04224">"Yes, monsieur, one and twenty years ago; and since then we have not
seen the poor marquis three times."</p>

<p id="id04225">"Thanks, thanks," said Monte Cristo, judging from the steward's utter
prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of
breaking it. "Give me a light."</p>

<p id="id04226">"Shall I accompany you, monsieur?"</p>

<p id="id04227">"No, it is unnecessary; Bertuccio will show me a light." And Monte
Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces, which
produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge. "Ah,
monsieur," said he, after having vainly searched on the mantle-piece and
the shelves, "I have not got any candles."</p>

<p id="id04228">"Take one of the carriage-lamps, Bertuccio," said the count, "and show
me the apartments." The steward obeyed in silence, but it was easy to
see, from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled, how
much it cost him to obey. They went over a tolerably large ground-floor;
a second floor consisted of a salon, a bathroom, and two bedrooms; near
one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to
the garden.</p>

<p id="id04229">"Ah, here is a private staircase," said the count; "that is convenient.<br>

Light me, M. Bertuccio, and go first; we will see where it leads to."<br></p>

<p id="id04230">"Monsieur," replied Bertuccio, "it leads to the garden."</p>

<p id="id04231">"And, pray, how do you know that?"</p>

<p id="id04232">"It ought to do so, at least."</p>

<p id="id04233">"Well, let us be sure of that." Bertuccio sighed, and went on first; the
stairs did, indeed, lead to the garden. At the outer door the steward
paused. "Go on, Monsieur Bertuccio," said the count. But he who was
addressed stood there, stupefied, bewildered, stunned; his haggard eyes
glanced around, as if in search of the traces of some terrible event,
and with his clinched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible
recollections. "Well," insisted the Count. "No, no," cried Bertuccio,
setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall. "No,
monsieur, it is impossible; I can go no farther."</p>

<p id="id04234">"What does this mean?" demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04235">"Why, you must see, your excellency," cried the steward, "that this is
not natural; that, having a house to purchase, you purchase it exactly
at Auteuil, and that, purchasing it at Auteuil, this house should be No.
28, Rue de la Fontaine. Oh, why did I not tell you all? I am sure you
would not have forced me to come. I hoped your house would have been
some other one than this; as if there was not another house at Auteuil
than that of the assassination!"</p>

<p id="id04236">"What, what!" cried Monte Cristo, stopping suddenly, "what words do
you utter? Devil of a man, Corsican that you are&#8212;always mysteries or
superstitions. Come, take the lantern, and let us visit the garden; you
are not afraid of ghosts with me, I hope?" Bertuccio raised the lantern,
and obeyed. The door, as it opened, disclosed a gloomy sky, in which the
moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her
with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant, only to
sink into obscurity. The steward wished to turn to the left. "No, no,
monsieur," said Monte Cristo. "What is the use of following the alleys?
Here is a beautiful lawn; let us go on straight forwards."</p>

<p id="id04237">Bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow, but obeyed; however, he
continued to take the left hand. Monte Cristo, on the contrary, took the
right hand; arrived near a clump of trees, he stopped. The steward could
not restrain himself. "Move, monsieur&#8212;move away, I entreat you; you are
exactly in the spot!"</p>

<p id="id04238">"What spot?"</p>

<p id="id04239">"Where he fell."</p>

<p id="id04240">"My dear Monsieur Bertuccio," said Monte Cristo, laughing, "control
yourself; we are not at Sartena or at Corte. This is not a Corsican
arbor, but an English garden; badly kept, I own, but still you must not
calumniate it for that."</p>

<p id="id04241">"Monsieur, I implore you do not stay there!"</p>

<p id="id04242">"I think you are going mad, Bertuccio," said the count coldly. "If that
is the case, I warn you, I shall have you put in a lunatic asylum."</p>

<p id="id04243">"Alas, excellency," returned Bertuccio, joining his hands, and shaking
his head in a manner that would have excited the count's laughter,
had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him, and rendered him
attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience. "Alas,
excellency, the evil has arrived!"</p>

<p id="id04244">"M. Bertuccio," said the count, "I am very glad to tell you, that while
you gesticulate, you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man
possessed by a devil who will not leave him; and I have always observed,
that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret. I knew you
were a Corsican. I knew you were gloomy, and always brooding over some
old history of the vendetta; and I overlooked that in Italy, because
in Italy those things are thought nothing of. But in France they are
considered in very bad taste; there are gendarmes who occupy themselves
with such affairs, judges who condemn, and scaffolds which avenge."
Bertuccio clasped his hands, and as, in all these evolutions, he did not
let fall the lantern, the light showed his pale and altered countenance.
Monte Cristo examined him with the same look that, at Rome, he had bent
upon the execution of Andrea, and then, in a tone that made a shudder
pass through the veins of the poor steward,&#8212;"The Abbe Busoni, then told
me an untruth," said he, "when, after his journey in France, in 1829, he
sent you to me, with a letter of recommendation, in which he enumerated
all your valuable qualities. Well, I shall write to the abbe; I shall
hold him responsible for his protege's misconduct, and I shall soon know
all about this assassination. Only I warn you, that when I reside in
a country, I conform to all its code, and I have no wish to put myself
within the compass of the French laws for your sake."</p>

<p id="id04245">"Oh, do not do that, excellency; I have always served you faithfully,"
cried Bertuccio, in despair. "I have always been an honest man, and, as
far as lay in my power, I have done good."</p>

<p id="id04246">"I do not deny it," returned the count; "but why are you thus agitated.
It is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in
the cheeks, and such fever in the hands of a man."</p>

<p id="id04247">"But, your excellency," replied Bertuccio hesitatingly, "did not the
Abbe Busoni, who heard my confession in the prison at Nimes, tell you
that I had a heavy burden upon my conscience?"</p>

<p id="id04248">"Yes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward, I concluded
you had stolen&#8212;that was all."</p>

<p id="id04249">"Oh, your excellency," returned Bertuccio in deep contempt.</p>

<p id="id04250">"Or, as you are a Corsican, that you had been unable to resist the
desire of making a 'stiff,' as you call it."</p>

<p id="id04251">"Yes, my good master," cried Bertuccio, casting himself at the count's
feet, "it was simply vengeance&#8212;nothing else."</p>

<p id="id04252">"I understand that, but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes
you in this manner."</p>

<p id="id04253">"But, monsieur, it is very natural," returned Bertuccio, "since it was
in this house that my vengeance was accomplished."</p>

<p id="id04254">"What! my house?"</p>

<p id="id04255">"Oh, your excellency, it was not yours, then."</p>

<p id="id04256">"Whose, then? The Marquis de Saint-Meran, I think, the concierge said.<br>

What had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-Meran?"<br></p>

<p id="id04257">"Oh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another."</p>

<p id="id04258">"This is strange," returned Monte Cristo, seeming to yield to his
reflections, "that you should find yourself without any preparation in a
house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse."</p>

<p id="id04259">"Monsieur," said the steward, "it is fatality, I am sure. First,
you purchase a house at Auteuil&#8212;this house is the one where I have
committed an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same
staircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received
the blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried
his child. This is not chance, for chance, in this case, is too much
like providence."</p>

<p id="id04260">"Well, amiable Corsican, let us suppose it is providence. I always
suppose anything people please, and, besides, you must concede something
to diseased minds. Come, collect yourself, and tell me all."</p>

<p id="id04261">"I have related it but once, and that was to the Abbe Busoni. Such
things," continued Bertuccio, shaking his head, "are only related under
the seal of confession."</p>

<p id="id04262">"Then," said the count, "I refer you to your confessor. Turn Chartreux
or Trappist, and relate your secrets, but, as for me, I do not like
any one who is alarmed by such phantasms, and I do not choose that my
servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening. I confess
I am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police, for, in
Italy, justice is only paid when silent&#8212;in France she is paid only
when she speaks. Peste, I thought you somewhat Corsican, a great deal
smuggler, and an excellent steward; but I see you have other strings to
your bow. You are no longer in my service, Monsieur Bertuccio."</p>

<p id="id04263">"Oh, your excellency, your excellency!" cried the steward, struck with
terror at this threat, "if that is the only reason I cannot remain in
your service, I will tell all, for if I quit you, it will only be to go
to the scaffold."</p>

<p id="id04264">"That is different," replied Monte Cristo; "but if you intend to tell an
untruth, reflect it were better not to speak at all."</p>

<p id="id04265">"No, monsieur, I swear to you, by my hopes of salvation, I will tell you
all, for the Abbe Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret; but,
I pray you, go away from that plane-tree. The moon is just bursting
through the clouds, and there, standing where you do, and wrapped in
that cloak that conceals your figure, you remind me of M. de Villefort."</p>

<p id="id04266">"What!" cried Monte Cristo, "it was M. de Villefort?"</p>

<p id="id04267">"Your excellency knows him?"</p>

<p id="id04268">"The former royal attorney at Nimes?"</p>

<p id="id04269">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id04270">"Who married the Marquis of Saint-Meran's daughter?"</p>

<p id="id04271">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id04272">"Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe, the most upright,
the most rigid magistrate on the bench?"</p>

<p id="id04273">"Well, monsieur," said Bertuccio, "this man with this spotless
reputation"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04274">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id04275">"Was a villain."</p>

<p id="id04276">"Bah," replied Monte Cristo, "impossible!"</p>

<p id="id04277">"It is as I tell you."</p>

<p id="id04278">"Ah, really," said Monte Cristo. "Have you proof of this?"</p>

<p id="id04279">"I had it."</p>

<p id="id04280">"And you have lost it; how stupid!"</p>

<p id="id04281">"Yes; but by careful search it might be recovered."</p>

<p id="id04282">"Really," returned the count, "relate it to me, for it begins to
interest me." And the count, humming an air from "Lucia," went to sit
down on a bench, while Bertuccio followed him, collecting his thoughts.
Bertuccio remained standing before him.</p>

<h3 id="id04283" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 44. The Vendetta.</h3>

<p id="id04284">"At what point shall I begin my story, your excellency?" asked<br>

Bertuccio.<br></p>

<p id="id04285">"Where you please," returned Monte Cristo, "since I know nothing at all
of it."</p>

<p id="id04286">"I thought the Abbe Busoni had told your excellency."</p>

<p id="id04287">"Some particulars, doubtless, but that is seven or eight years ago, and<br>

I have forgotten them."<br></p>

<p id="id04288">"Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency."</p>

<p id="id04289">"Go on, M. Bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening papers."</p>

<p id="id04290">"The story begins in 1815."</p>

<p id="id04291">"Ah," said Monte Cristo, "1815 is not yesterday."</p>

<p id="id04292">"No, monsieur, and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had
happened but then. I had a brother, an elder brother, who was in the
service of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed
entirely of Corsicans. This brother was my only friend; we became
orphans&#8212;I at five, he at eighteen. He brought me up as if I had been
his son, and in 1814 he married. When the emperor returned from the
Island of Elba, my brother instantly joined the army, was slightly
wounded at Waterloo, and retired with the army beyond the Loire."</p>

<p id="id04293">"But that is the history of the Hundred Days, M. Bertuccio," said the
count; "unless I am mistaken, it has been already written."</p>

<p id="id04294">"Excuse me, excellency, but these details are necessary, and you
promised to be patient."</p>

<p id="id04295">"Go on; I will keep my word."</p>

<p id="id04296">"One day we received a letter. I should tell you that we lived in the
little village of Rogliano, at the extremity of Cape Corso. This letter
was from my brother. He told us that the army was disbanded, and that he
should return by Chateauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and Nimes; and,
if I had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at Nimes, with an
inn-keeper with whom I had dealings."</p>

<p id="id04297">"In the smuggling line?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04298">"Eh, your excellency? Every one must live."</p>

<p id="id04299">"Certainly; go on."</p>

<p id="id04300">"I loved my brother tenderly, as I told your excellency, and I resolved
not to send the money, but to take it to him myself. I possessed a
thousand francs. I left five hundred with Assunta, my sister-in-law, and
with the other five hundred I set off for Nimes. It was easy to do so,
and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything favored
my project. But, after we had taken in our cargo, the wind became
contrary, so that we were four or five days without being able to enter
the Rhone. At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to Arles. I
left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and took the road to
Nimes."</p>

<p id="id04301">"We are getting to the story now?"</p>

<p id="id04302">"Yes, your excellency; excuse me, but, as you will see, I only tell you
what is absolutely necessary. Just at this time the famous massacres
took place in the south of France. Three brigands, called Trestaillon,
Truphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they
suspected of Bonapartism. You have doubtless heard of these massacres,
your excellency?"</p>

<p id="id04303">"Vaguely; I was far from France at that period. Go on."</p>

<p id="id04304">"As I entered Nimes, I literally waded in blood; at every step you
encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers, who killed, plundered,
and burned. At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became
terrified, not for myself&#8212;for I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had
nothing to fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us
smugglers&#8212;but for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from
the army of the Loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was
everything to apprehend. I hastened to the inn-keeper. My misgivings had
been but too true. My brother had arrived the previous evening at
Nimes, and, at the very door of the house where he was about to demand
hospitality, he had been assassinated. I did all in my power to discover
the murderers, but no one durst tell me their names, so much were they
dreaded. I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so
much, and which feared nothing, and I went to the king's attorney."</p>

<p id="id04305">"And this king's attorney was named Villefort?" asked Monte Cristo
carelessly.</p>

<p id="id04306">"Yes, your excellency; he came from Marseilles, where he had been
deputy-procureur. His zeal had procured him advancement, and he was said
to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure
from the Island of Elba."</p>

<p id="id04307">"Then," said Monte Cristo "you went to him?"</p>

<p id="id04308">"'Monsieur,' I said, 'my brother was assassinated yesterday in the
streets of Nimes, I know not by whom, but it is your duty to find out.
You are the representative of justice here, and it is for justice to
avenge those she has been unable to protect.'&#8212;'Who was your brother?'
asked he.&#8212;'A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion.'&#8212;'A soldier of the
usurper, then?'&#8212;'A soldier of the French army.'&#8212;'Well,' replied he,
'he has smitten with the sword, and he has perished by the sword.'&#8212;'You
are mistaken, monsieur,' I replied; 'he has perished by the
poniard.'&#8212;'What do you want me to do?' asked the magistrate.&#8212;'I have
already told you&#8212;avenge him.'&#8212;'On whom?'&#8212;'On his murderers.'&#8212;'How
should I know who they are?'&#8212;'Order them to be sought for.'&#8212;'Why, your
brother has been involved in a quarrel, and killed in a duel. All these
old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the
emperor, but which are not suffered now, for the people here do not like
soldiers of such disorderly conduct.'&#8212;'Monsieur,' I replied, 'it is not
for myself that I entreat your interference&#8212;I should grieve for him or
avenge him, but my poor brother had a wife, and were anything to happen
to me, the poor creature would perish from want, for my brother's pay
alone kept her. Pray, try and obtain a small government pension for
her.'</p>

<p id="id04309">"'Every revolution has its catastrophes,' returned M. de Villefort;
'your brother has been the victim of this. It is a misfortune, and
government owes nothing to his family. If we are to judge by all the
vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans
of the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your brother would
be to-day, in all probability, condemned to death. What has happened is
quite natural, and in conformity with the law of reprisals.'&#8212;'What,'
cried I, 'do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?'&#8212;'All these Corsicans
are mad, on my honor,' replied M. de Villefort; 'they fancy that their
countryman is still emperor. You have mistaken the time, you should have
told me this two months ago, it is too late now. Go now, at once, or I
shall have you put out.'</p>

<p id="id04310">"I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from
further entreaty. But he was a man of stone. I approached him, and said
in a low voice, 'Well, since you know the Corsicans so well, you know
that they always keep their word. You think that it was a good deed
to kill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist.
Well, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is,
that I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta against
you, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet
your last hour has come.' And before he had recovered from his surprise,
I opened the door and left the room."</p>

<p id="id04311">"Well, well," said Monte Cristo, "such an innocent looking person as you
are to do those things, M. Bertuccio, and to a king's attorney at that!
But did he know what was meant by the terrible word 'vendetta'?"</p>

<p id="id04312">"He knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his house,
and never went out unattended, seeking me high and low. Fortunately, I
was so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he became alarmed,
and dared not stay any longer at Nimes, so he solicited a change of
residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was nominated
to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to avenge
himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it went, was
never above half a day's journey before me, who followed him on foot.
The most important thing was, not to kill him only&#8212;for I had an
opportunity of doing so a hundred times&#8212;but to kill him without being
discovered&#8212;at least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged to
myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for. For three
months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took not a step
out-of-doors without my following him. At length I discovered that he
went mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him thither, and I saw him
enter the house where we now are, only, instead of entering by the
great door that looks into the street, he came on horseback, or in his
carriage, left the one or the other at the little inn, and entered by
the gate you see there." Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to
show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio
alluded. "As I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil,
and gained all the information I could. If I wished to surprise him,
it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house
belonged, as the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de
Saint-Meran, Villefort's father-in-law. M. de Saint-Meran lived at
Marseilles, so that this country house was useless to him, and it was
reported to be let to a young widow, known only by the name of 'the
baroness.'</p>

<p id="id04313">"One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and handsome
woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not overlooked by
any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de Villefort. When
she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features, I saw she
was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair. As she had a loose
muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure, I saw she would ere
long become a mother. A few moments after, the little door was opened
and a man entered. The young woman hastened to meet him. They threw
themselves into each other's arms, embraced tenderly, and returned
together to the house. The man was M. de Villefort; I fully believed
that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the
whole of the garden alone."</p>

<p id="id04314">"And," asked the count, "did you ever know the name of this woman?"</p>

<p id="id04315">"No, excellency," returned Bertuccio; "you will see that I had no time
to learn it."</p>

<p id="id04316">"Go on."</p>

<p id="id04317">"That evening," continued Bertuccio, "I could have killed the procureur,
but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood, I was
fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if his cries were
overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the next occasion, and
in order that nothing should escape me, I took a chamber looking into
the street bordered by the wall of the garden. Three days after, about
seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a servant on horseback leave the
house at full gallop, and take the road to Sevres. I concluded that he
was going to Versailles, and I was not deceived. Three hours later,
the man returned covered with dust, his errand was performed, and two
minutes after, another man on foot, muffled in a mantle, opened the
little door of the garden, which he closed after him. I descended
rapidly; although I had not seen Villefort's face, I recognized him by
the beating of my heart. I crossed the street, and stopped at a post
placed at the angle of the wall, and by means of which I had once before
looked into the garden. This time I did not content myself with looking,
but I took my knife out of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and
sprang over the wall. My first care was to run to the door; he had left
the key in it, taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the
lock. Nothing, then, preventing my escape by this means, I examined
the grounds. The garden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf
extended down the middle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with
thick and massy foliage, that made a background for the shrubs and
flowers. In order to go from the door to the house, or from the house
to the door, M. de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these
clumps of trees.</p>

<p id="id04318">"It was the end of September; the wind blew violently. The faint
glimpses of the pale moon, hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds
that were sweeping across the sky, whitened the gravel walks that led
to the house, but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick
shrubberies, in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of
discovery. I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must
take, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I
fancied I heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your
excellency, that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that
he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears. Two hours passed
thus, during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly. Midnight struck.
As the last stroke died away, I saw a faint light shine through the
windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended. The
door opened, and the man in the mantle reappeared. The terrible moment
had come, but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not
fail in the least. I drew my knife from my pocket again, opened it, and
made ready to strike. The man in the mantle advanced towards me, but as
he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his hand. I was afraid, not
of a struggle, but of a failure. When he was only a few paces from me,
I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a spade. I was still
unable to divine for what reason M. de Villefort had this spade in his
hands, when he stopped close to the thicket where I was, glanced round,
and began to dig a hole in the earth. I then perceived that he was
hiding something under his mantle, which he laid on the grass in order
to dig more freely. Then, I confess, curiosity mingled with hatred;
I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there, and I remained
motionless, holding my breath. Then an idea crossed my mind, which was
confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box, two
feet long, and six or eight inches deep. I let him place the box in the
hole he had made, then, while he stamped with his feet to remove all
traces of his occupation, I rushed on him and plunged my knife into
his breast, exclaiming,&#8212;'I am Giovanni Bertuccio; thy death for my
brother's; thy treasure for his widow; thou seest that my vengeance is
more complete than I had hoped.' I know not if he heard these words; I
think he did not, for he fell without a cry. I felt his blood gush
over my face, but I was intoxicated, I was delirious, and the blood
refreshed, instead of burning me. In a second I had disinterred the box;
then, that it might not be known I had done so, I filled up the hole,
threw the spade over the wall, and rushed through the door, which I
double-locked, carrying off the key."</p>

<p id="id04319">"Ah," said Monte Cristo "it seems to me this was nothing but murder and
robbery."</p>

<p id="id04320">"No, your excellency," returned Bertuccio; "it was a vendetta followed
by restitution."</p>

<p id="id04321">"And was the sum a large one?"</p>

<p id="id04322">"It was not money."</p>

<p id="id04323">"Ah, I recollect," replied the count; "did you not say something of an
infant?"</p>
