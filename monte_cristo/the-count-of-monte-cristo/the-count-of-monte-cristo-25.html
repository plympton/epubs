<p id="id06923">"Can he give me any particulars?"</p>

<p id="id06924">"Important ones; he was in India with Zaccone."</p>

<p id="id06925">"Do you know his abode?"</p>

<p id="id06926">"It's somewhere in the Chaussee d'Antin; but I know neither the street
nor the number."</p>

<p id="id06927">"Are you at variance with the Englishman?"</p>

<p id="id06928">"I love Zaccone, and he hates him; we are consequently not friends."</p>

<p id="id06929">"Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before
he made this visit to Paris?"</p>

<p id="id06930">"To that question I can answer positively; no, sir, he had not, because
he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required, and
as I did not know when I might again come to Paris, I recommended M.
Cavalcanti to him."</p>

<p id="id06931">"Andrea?"</p>

<p id="id06932">"No, Bartolomeo, his father."</p>

<p id="id06933">"Now, sir, I have but one question more to ask, and I charge you, in the
name of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me candidly."</p>

<p id="id06934">"What is it, sir?"</p>

<p id="id06935">"Do you know with what design M. de Monte Cristo purchased a house at<br>

Auteuil?"<br></p>

<p id="id06936">"Certainly, for he told me."</p>

<p id="id06937">"What is it, sir?"</p>

<p id="id06938">"To make a lunatic asylum of it, similar to that founded by the Count of<br>

Pisani at Palermo. Do you know about that institution?"<br></p>

<p id="id06939">"I have heard of it."</p>

<p id="id06940">"It is a magnificent charity." Having said this, the abbe bowed to
imply he wished to pursue his studies. The visitor either understood the
abbe's meaning, or had no more questions to ask; he arose, and the
abbe accompanied him to the door. "You are a great almsgiver," said the
visitor, "and although you are said to be rich, I will venture to offer
you something for your poor people; will you accept my offering?"</p>

<p id="id06941">"I thank you, sir; I am only jealous in one thing, and that is that the
relief I give should be entirely from my own resources."</p>

<p id="id06942">"However"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06943">"My resolution, sir, is unchangeable, but you have only to search for
yourself and you will find, alas, but too many objects upon whom to
exercise your benevolence." The abbe once more bowed as he opened the
door, the stranger bowed and took his leave, and the carriage conveyed
him straight to the house of M. de Villefort. An hour afterwards
the carriage was again ordered, and this time it went to the Rue
Fontaine-Saint-George, and stopped at No. 5, where Lord Wilmore lived.
The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore, requesting an interview, which
the latter had fixed for ten o'clock. As the envoy of the prefect of
police arrived ten minutes before ten, he was told that Lord Wilmore,
who was precision and punctuality personified, was not yet come in, but
that he would be sure to return as the clock struck.</p>

<p id="id06944">The visitor was introduced into the drawing-room, which was like all
other furnished drawing-rooms. A mantle-piece, with two modern Sevres
vases, a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with
an engraving on each side&#8212;one representing Homer carrying his
guide, the other, Belisarius begging&#8212;a grayish paper; red and black
tapestry&#8212;such was the appearance of Lord Wilmore's drawing-room. It was
illuminated by lamps with ground-glass shades which gave only a feeble
light, as if out of consideration for the envoy's weak sight. After ten
minutes' expectation the clock struck ten; at the fifth stroke the door
opened and Lord Wilmore appeared. He was rather above the middle height,
with thin reddish whiskers, light complexion and light hair, turning
rather gray. He was dressed with all the English peculiarity, namely, in
a blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar, in the fashion of 1811,
a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen pantaloons, three inches too
short, but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the
knee. His first remark on entering was,&#8212;"You know, sir, I do not speak
French?"</p>

<p id="id06945">"I know you do not like to converse in our language," replied the envoy.<br>

"But you may use it," replied Lord Wilmore; "I understand it."<br></p>

<p id="id06946">"And I," replied the visitor, changing his idiom, "know enough of
English to keep up the conversation. Do not put yourself to the
slightest inconvenience."</p>

<p id="id06947">"Aw?" said Lord Wilmore, with that tone which is only known to natives
of Great Britain.</p>

<p id="id06948">The envoy presented his letter of introduction, which the latter read
with English coolness, and having finished,&#8212;"I understand," said he,
"perfectly."</p>

<p id="id06949">Then began the questions, which were similar to those which had been
addressed to the Abbe Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of
the count's enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more
numerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten
years of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of
India who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met
him and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken
prisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had
escaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices;
then the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the
Grecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in
the mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from
every one. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was
consolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district,
which was given him. Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord
Wilmore's opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per
annum,&#8212;a precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the
failure of the mine.</p>

<p id="id06950">"But," asked the visitor, "do you know why he came to France?"</p>

<p id="id06951">"He is speculating in railways," said Lord Wilmore, "and as he is
an expert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of
telegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection."</p>

<p id="id06952">"How much does he spend yearly?" asked the prefect.</p>

<p id="id06953">"Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs," said Lord Wilmore;
"he is a miser." Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman, who, knowing
no other reproach to bring on the count, accused him of avarice. "Do you
know his house at Auteuil?"</p>

<p id="id06954">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id06955">"What do you know respecting it?"</p>

<p id="id06956">"Do you wish to know why he bought it?"</p>

<p id="id06957">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id06958">"The count is a speculator, who will certainly ruin himself in
experiments. He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he
has bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagneres, Luchon, and
Cauterets. He is going to turn his house into a Badhaus, as the Germans
term it. He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find
the famous spring, and, being unsuccessful, he will soon purchase all
the contiguous houses. Now, as I dislike him, and hope his railway,
his electric telegraph, or his search for baths, will ruin him, I am
watching for his discomfiture, which must soon take place."</p>

<p id="id06959">"What was the cause of your quarrel?"</p>

<p id="id06960">"When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends."</p>

<p id="id06961">"Why do you not seek revenge?"</p>

<p id="id06962">"I have already fought three duels with him," said the Englishman, "the
first with the pistol, the second with the sword, and the third with the
sabre."</p>

<p id="id06963">"And what was the result of those duels?"</p>

<p id="id06964">"The first time, he broke my arm; the second, he wounded me in the
breast; and the third time, made this large wound." The Englishman
turned down his shirt-collar, and showed a scar, whose redness proved
it to be a recent one. "So that, you see, there is a deadly feud between
us."</p>

<p id="id06965">"But," said the envoy, "you do not go about it in the right way to kill
him, if I understand you correctly."</p>

<p id="id06966">"Aw?" said the Englishman, "I practice shooting every day, and every
other day Grisier comes to my house."</p>

<p id="id06967">This was all the visitor wished to ascertain, or, rather, all the
Englishman appeared to know. The agent arose, and having bowed to Lord
Wilmore, who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the
English, he retired. Lord Wilmore, having heard the door close after
him, returned to his bedroom, where with one hand he pulled off his
light hair, his red whiskers, his false jaw, and his wound, to resume
the black hair, dark complexion, and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte
Cristo. It was M. de Villefort, and not the prefect, who returned to the
house of M. de Villefort. The procureur felt more at ease, although he
had learned nothing really satisfactory, and, for the first time since
the dinner-party at Auteuil, he slept soundly.</p>

<h3 id="id06968" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 70. The Ball.</h3>

<p id="id06969">It was in the warmest days of July, when in due course of time the
Saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M. de
Morcerf's. It was ten o'clock at night; the branches of the great trees
in the garden of the count's house stood out boldly against the azure
canopy of heaven, which was studded with golden stars, but where
the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered. From the
apartments on the ground-floor might be heard the sound of music, with
the whirl of the waltz and galop, while brilliant streams of light shone
through the openings of the Venetian blinds. At this moment the garden
was only occupied by about ten servants, who had just received orders
from their mistress to prepare the supper, the serenity of the weather
continuing to increase. Until now, it had been undecided whether the
supper should take place in the dining-room, or under a long tent
erected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with stars, had
settled the question in favor of the lawn. The gardens were illuminated
with colored lanterns, according to the Italian custom, and, as is usual
in countries where the luxuries of the table&#8212;the rarest of all luxuries
in their complete form&#8212;are well understood, the supper-table was loaded
with wax-lights and flowers.</p>

<p id="id06970">At the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving
her orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming
hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the
count; for, owing to the good taste of Mercedes, one was sure of finding
some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing, or even copying
in case of need. Madame Danglars, in whom the events we have related had
caused deep anxiety, had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerf's,
when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort.
The latter made a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together,
said,&#8212;"You are going to Madame de Morcerf's, are you not?"</p>

<p id="id06971">"No," replied Madame Danglars, "I am too ill."</p>

<p id="id06972">"You are wrong," replied Villefort, significantly; "it is important that
you should be seen there."</p>

<p id="id06973">"Do you think so?" asked the baroness.</p>

<p id="id06974">"I do."</p>

<p id="id06975">"In that case I will go." And the two carriages passed on towards
their different destinations. Madame Danglars therefore came, not only
beautiful in person, but radiant with splendor; she entered by one door
at the time when Mercedes appeared at the door. The countess took Albert
to meet Madame Danglars. He approached, paid her some well merited
compliments on her toilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat.
Albert looked around him. "You are looking for my daughter?" said the
baroness, smiling.</p>

<p id="id06976">"I confess it," replied Albert. "Could you have been so cruel as not to
bring her?"</p>

<p id="id06977">"Calm yourself. She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort, and has taken
her arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a
bouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis. But tell me"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06978">"Well, what do you wish to know?"</p>

<p id="id06979">"Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here to-night?"</p>

<p id="id06980">"Seventeen!" replied Albert.</p>

<p id="id06981">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id06982">"I only mean that the count seems the rage," replied the viscount,
smiling, "and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the
same question. The count is in fashion; I congratulate him upon it."</p>

<p id="id06983">"And have you replied to every one as you have to me?"</p>

<p id="id06984">"Ah, to be sure, I have not answered you; be satisfied, we shall have
this 'lion;' we are among the privileged ones."</p>

<p id="id06985">"Were you at the opera yesterday?"</p>

<p id="id06986">"No."</p>

<p id="id06987">"He was there."</p>

<p id="id06988">"Ah, indeed? And did the eccentric person commit any new originality?"</p>

<p id="id06989">"Can he be seen without doing so? Elssler was dancing in the 'Diable
Boiteux;' the Greek princess was in ecstasies. After the cachucha he
placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet, and threw it to
the charming danseuse, who, in the third act, to do honor to the gift,
reappeared with it on her finger. And the Greek princess,&#8212;will she be
here?"</p>

<p id="id06990">"No, you will be deprived of that pleasure; her position in the count's
establishment is not sufficiently understood."</p>

<p id="id06991">"Wait; leave me here, and go and speak to Madame de Villefort, who is
trying to attract your attention."</p>

<p id="id06992">Albert bowed to Madame Danglars, and advanced towards Madame de<br>

Villefort, whose lips opened as he approached. "I wager anything," said<br>

Albert, interrupting her, "that I know what you were about to say."<br></p>

<p id="id06993">"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p id="id06994">"If I guess rightly, will you confess it?"</p>

<p id="id06995">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id06996">"On your honor?"</p>

<p id="id06997">"On my honor."</p>

<p id="id06998">"You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived, or
was expected."</p>

<p id="id06999">"Not at all. It is not of him that I am now thinking. I was going to ask
you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz."</p>

<p id="id07000">"Yes,&#8212;yesterday."</p>

<p id="id07001">"What did he tell you?"</p>

<p id="id07002">"That he was leaving at the same time as his letter."</p>

<p id="id07003">"Well, now then, the count?"</p>

<p id="id07004">"The count will come, of that you may be satisfied."</p>

<p id="id07005">"You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id07006">"No, I did not know it."</p>

<p id="id07007">"Monte Cristo is the name of an island, and he has a family name."</p>

<p id="id07008">"I never heard it."</p>

<p id="id07009">"Well, then, I am better informed than you; his name is Zaccone."</p>

<p id="id07010">"It is possible."</p>

<p id="id07011">"He is a Maltese."</p>

<p id="id07012">"That is also possible.</p>

<p id="id07013">"The son of a shipowner."</p>

<p id="id07014">"Really, you should relate all this aloud, you would have the greatest
success."</p>

<p id="id07015">"He served in India, discovered a mine in Thessaly, and comes to Paris
to establish a mineral water-cure at Auteuil."</p>

<p id="id07016">"Well, I'm sure," said Morcerf, "this is indeed news! Am I allowed to
repeat it?"</p>

<p id="id07017">"Yes, but cautiously, tell one thing at a time, and do not say I told
you."</p>

<p id="id07018">"Why so?"</p>

<p id="id07019">"Because it is a secret just discovered."</p>

<p id="id07020">"By whom?"</p>

<p id="id07021">"The police."</p>

<p id="id07022">"Then the news originated"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id07023">"At the prefect's last night. Paris, you can understand, is astonished
at the sight of such unusual splendor, and the police have made
inquiries."</p>

<p id="id07024">"Well, well! Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a
vagabond, on the pretext of his being too rich."</p>

<p id="id07025">"Indeed, that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not
been so favorable."</p>

<p id="id07026">"Poor count! And is he aware of the danger he has been in?"</p>

<p id="id07027">"I think not."</p>

<p id="id07028">"Then it will be but charitable to inform him. When he arrives, I will
not fail to do so."</p>

<p id="id07029">Just then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and
glossy mustache, respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort. Albert
extended his hand. "Madame," said Albert, "allow me to present to you M.
Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis, one of our best, and, above all,
of our bravest officers."</p>

<p id="id07030">"I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil,
at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo," replied Madame de Villefort,
turning away with marked coldness of manner. This answer, and especially
the tone in which it was uttered, chilled the heart of poor Morrel. But
a recompense was in store for him; turning around, he saw near the door
a beautiful fair face, whose large blue eyes were, without any marked
expression, fixed upon him, while the bouquet of myosotis was gently
raised to her lips.</p>

<p id="id07031">The salutation was so well understood that Morrel, with the same
expression in his eyes, placed his handkerchief to his mouth; and these
two living statues, whose hearts beat so violently under their marble
aspect, separated from each other by the whole length of the room,
forgot themselves for a moment, or rather forgot the world in their
mutual contemplation. They might have remained much longer lost in one
another, without any one noticing their abstraction. The Count of Monte
Cristo had just entered.</p>

<p id="id07032">We have already said that there was something in the count which
attracted universal attention wherever he appeared. It was not the coat,
unexceptional in its cut, though simple and unornamented; it was not the
plain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers, that displayed the foot
so perfectly formed&#8212;it was none of these things that attracted the
attention,&#8212;it was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his calm
and serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth, chiselled
with such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such high
disdain,&#8212;these were what fixed the attention of all upon him. Many
men might have been handsomer, but certainly there could be none
whose appearance was more significant, if the expression may be used.
Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning, for the constant
habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor
to the expression of his face, and even to the most trifling gesture,
scarcely to be understood. Yet the Parisian world is so strange, that
even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected
with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune.</p>

<p id="id07033">Meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery
of curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf, who, standing before
a mantle-piece ornamented with flowers, had seen his entrance in a
looking-glass placed opposite the door, and was prepared to receive him.
She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was
bowing to her. No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her, while
on his side the count thought she was about to address him; but both
remained silent, and after a mere bow, Monte Cristo directed his steps
to Albert, who received him cordially. "Have you seen my mother?" asked
Albert.</p>

<p id="id07034">"I have just had the pleasure," replied the count; "but I have not seen
your father."</p>

<p id="id07035">"See, he is down there, talking politics with that little group of great
geniuses."</p>

<p id="id07036">"Indeed?" said Monte Cristo; "and so those gentlemen down there are
men of great talent. I should not have guessed it. And for what kind of
talent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts."</p>

<p id="id07037">"That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the
neighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than
lizards usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the
Institute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided
in his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the
learned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion of
Honor, was made an officer."</p>

<p id="id07038">"Come," said Monte Cristo, "this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded.
I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they would have
made him a commander."</p>

<p id="id07039">"Very likely," said Albert.</p>

<p id="id07040">"And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap
himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?"</p>

<p id="id07041">"Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic's, which deputed<br>

David [*] to devise a uniform for the Academicians."<br></p>

<p id="id07042">     * Louis David, a famous French painter.</p>

<p id="id07043">"Indeed?" said Monte Cristo; "so this gentleman is an Academician?"</p>

<p id="id07044">"Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly."</p>

<p id="id07045">"And what is his especial talent?"</p>

<p id="id07046">"His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he
makes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with
whalebone."</p>

<p id="id07047">"And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?"</p>

<p id="id07048">"No; of the French Academy."</p>

<p id="id07049">"But what has the French Academy to do with all this?"</p>

<p id="id07050">"I was going to tell you. It seems"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id07051">"That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of
science, doubtless?"</p>

<p id="id07052">"No; that his style of writing is very good."</p>

<p id="id07053">"This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose
heads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and
to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?"</p>

<p id="id07054">Albert laughed.</p>

<p id="id07055">"And the other one?" demanded the count.</p>

<p id="id07056">"That one?"</p>

<p id="id07057">"Yes, the third."</p>

<p id="id07058">"The one in the dark blue coat?"</p>

<p id="id07059">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07060">"He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents to
the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was very
successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal papers,
but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him
into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an ambassador."</p>

<p id="id07061">"And what are his claims to the peerage?"</p>

<p id="id07062">"He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five
articles in the Siecle, and voted five or six years on the ministerial
side."</p>

<p id="id07063">"Bravo, Viscount," said Monte Cristo, smiling; "you are a delightful
cicerone. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?"</p>

<p id="id07064">"What is it?"</p>

<p id="id07065">"Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish it,
you will warn me." Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He turned
round; it was Danglars.</p>

<p id="id07066">"Ah, is it you, baron?" said he.</p>

<p id="id07067">"Why do you call me baron?" said Danglars; "you know that I care nothing
for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title, do you
not?"</p>

<p id="id07068">"Certainly," replied Albert, "seeing that without my title I should
be nothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the
millionaire."</p>

<p id="id07069">"Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July," replied<br>

Danglars.<br></p>

<p id="id07070">"Unfortunately," said Monte Cristo, "one's title to a millionaire does
not last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or Academician;
for example, the millionaires Franck &amp; Poulmann, of Frankfort, who have
just become bankrupts."</p>

<p id="id07071">"Indeed?" said Danglars, becoming pale.</p>

<p id="id07072">"Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a
million in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month ago."</p>

<p id="id07073">"Ah, mon Dieu," exclaimed Danglars, "they have drawn on me for 200,000
francs!"</p>

<p id="id07074">"Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per
cent."</p>

<p id="id07075">"Yes, but it is too late," said Danglars, "I have honored their bills."</p>

<p id="id07076">"Then," said Monte Cristo, "here are 200,000 francs gone after"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id07077">"Hush, do not mention these things," said Danglars; then, approaching
Monte Cristo, he added, "especially before young M. Cavalcanti;" after
which he smiled, and turned towards the young man in question. Albert
had left the count to speak to his mother, Danglars to converse with
young Cavalcanti; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone. Meanwhile the
heat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through the rooms with
waiters loaded with ices. Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his
forehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he took no
refreshment. Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo; she
saw that he took nothing, and even noticed his gesture of refusal.</p>

<p id="id07078">"Albert," she asked, "did you notice that?"</p>

<p id="id07079">"What, mother?"</p>

<p id="id07080">"That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof
of M. de Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id07081">"Yes; but then he breakfasted with me&#8212;indeed, he made his first
appearance in the world on that occasion."</p>

<p id="id07082">"But your house is not M. de Morcerf's," murmured Mercedes; "and since
he has been here I have watched him."</p>

<p id="id07083">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id07084">"Well, he has taken nothing yet."</p>

<p id="id07085">"The count is very temperate." Mercedes smiled sadly. "Approach him,"
said she, "and when the next waiter passes, insist upon his taking
something."</p>

<p id="id07086">"But why, mother?"</p>

<p id="id07087">"Just to please me, Albert," said Mercedes. Albert kissed his mother's
hand, and drew near the count. Another salver passed, loaded like the
preceding ones; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count, but he
obstinately refused. Albert rejoined his mother; she was very pale.</p>

<p id="id07088">"Well," said she, "you see he refuses?"</p>

<p id="id07089">"Yes; but why need this annoy you?"</p>

<p id="id07090">"You know, Albert, women are singular creatures. I should like to have
seen the count take something in my house, if only an ice. Perhaps he
cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living, and might prefer
something else."</p>

<p id="id07091">"Oh, no; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy; no doubt he does
not feel inclined this evening."</p>

<p id="id07092">"And besides," said the countess, "accustomed as he is to burning
climates, possibly he does not feel the heat as we do."</p>

<p id="id07093">"I do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost
suffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as
the windows."</p>

<p id="id07094">"In a word," said Mercedes, "it was a way of assuring me that his
abstinence was intended." And she left the room. A minute afterwards
the blinds were thrown open, and through the jessamine and clematis that
overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns,
and the supper laid under the tent. Dancers, players, talkers, all
uttered an exclamation of joy&#8212;every one inhaled with delight the
breeze that floated in. At the same time Mercedes reappeared, paler than
before, but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which
she sometimes wore. She went straight to the group of which her husband
formed the centre. "Do not detain those gentlemen here, count," she
said; "they would prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden
rather than suffocate here, since they are not playing."</p>

<p id="id07095">"Ah," said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung "Partant pour
la Syrie,"&#8212;"we will not go alone to the garden."</p>

<p id="id07096">"Then," said Mercedes, "I will lead the way." Turning towards Monte
Cristo, she added, "count, will you oblige me with your arm?" The
count almost staggered at these simple words; then he fixed his eyes on
Mercedes. It was only a momentary glance, but it seemed to the countess
to have lasted for a century, so much was expressed in that one look. He
offered his arm to the countess; she took it, or rather just touched it
with her little hand, and they together descended the steps, lined with
rhododendrons and camellias. Behind them, by another outlet, a group of
about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of
delight.</p>

<h3 id="id07097" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 71. Bread and Salt.</h3>

<p id="id07098">Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion. It led
through a grove of lindens to a conservatory.</p>

<p id="id07099">"It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?" she asked.</p>

<p id="id07100">"Yes, madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors
and the blinds." As he ceased speaking, the count felt the hand of
Mercedes tremble. "But you," he said, "with that light dress, and
without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf, perhaps you feel
cold?"</p>

<p id="id07101">"Do you know where I am leading you?" said the countess, without
replying to the question.</p>

<p id="id07102">"No, madame," replied Monte Cristo; "but you see I make no resistance."</p>

<p id="id07103">"We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the
grove."</p>

<p id="id07104">The count looked at Mercedes as if to interrogate her, but she continued
to walk on in silence, and he refrained from speaking. They reached
the building, ornamented with magnificent fruits, which ripen at the
beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of
the sun, so frequently absent in our climate. The countess left the arm
of Monte Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes. "See, count,"
she said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost
detect the tears on her eyelids&#8212;"see, our French grapes are not to be
compared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but you will make
allowance for our northern sun." The count bowed, but stepped back.
"Do you refuse?" said Mercedes, in a tremulous voice. "Pray excuse me,
madame," replied Monte Cristo, "but I never eat Muscatel grapes."</p>

<p id="id07105">Mercedes let them fall, and sighed. A magnificent peach was hanging
against an adjoining wall, ripened by the same artificial heat. Mercedes
drew near, and plucked the fruit. "Take this peach, then," she said. The
count again refused. "What, again?" she exclaimed, in so plaintive an
accent that it seemed to stifle a sob; "really, you pain me."</p>

<p id="id07106">A long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the
ground. "Count," added Mercedes with a supplicating glance, "there is a
beautiful Arabian custom, which makes eternal friends of those who have
together eaten bread and salt under the same roof."</p>

<p id="id07107">"I know it, madame," replied the count; "but we are in France, and not
in Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom
of dividing bread and salt with one another."</p>

<p id="id07108">"But," said the countess, breathlessly, with her eyes fixed on Monte
Cristo, whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands, "we are
friends, are we not?"</p>

<p id="id07109">The count became pale as death, the blood rushed to his heart, and then
again rising, dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of
a man suddenly dazzled. "Certainly, we are friends," he replied; "why
should we not be?" The answer was so little like the one Mercedes
desired, that she turned away to give vent to a sigh, which sounded more
like a groan. "Thank you," she said. And they walked on again. They went
the whole length of the garden without uttering a word. "Sir," suddenly
exclaimed the countess, after their walk had continued ten minutes in
silence, "is it true that you have seen so much, travelled so far, and
suffered so deeply?"</p>

<p id="id07110">"I have suffered deeply, madame," answered Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id07111">"But now you are happy?"</p>

<p id="id07112">"Doubtless," replied the count, "since no one hears me complain."</p>

<p id="id07113">"And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?"</p>

<p id="id07114">"My present happiness equals my past misery," said the count.</p>

<p id="id07115">"Are you not married?" asked the countess. "I, married?" exclaimed Monte<br>

Cristo, shuddering; "who could have told you so?"<br></p>

<p id="id07116">"No one told me you were, but you have frequently been seen at the opera
with a young and lovely woman."</p>

<p id="id07117">"She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople, madame, the daughter of
a prince. I have adopted her as my daughter, having no one else to love
in the world."</p>

<p id="id07118">"You live alone, then?"</p>

<p id="id07119">"I do."</p>

<p id="id07120">"You have no sister&#8212;no son&#8212;no father?"</p>

<p id="id07121">"I have no one."</p>

<p id="id07122">"How can you exist thus without any one to attach you to life?"</p>

<p id="id07123">"It is not my fault, madame. At Malta, I loved a young girl, was on the
point of marrying her, when war came and carried me away. I thought she
loved me well enough to wait for me, and even to remain faithful to my
memory. When I returned she was married. This is the history of most men
who have passed twenty years of age. Perhaps my heart was weaker than
the hearts of most men, and I suffered more than they would have done in
my place; that is all." The countess stopped for a moment, as if gasping
for breath. "Yes," she said, "and you have still preserved this love in
your heart&#8212;one can only love once&#8212;and did you ever see her again?"</p>

<p id="id07124">"Never."</p>

<p id="id07125">"Never?"</p>

<p id="id07126">"I never returned to the country where she lived."</p>

<p id="id07127">"To Malta?"</p>

<p id="id07128">"Yes; Malta."</p>

<p id="id07129">"She is, then, now at Malta?"</p>

<p id="id07130">"I think so."</p>

<p id="id07131">"And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?"</p>

<p id="id07132">"Her,&#8212;yes."</p>

<p id="id07133">"But only her; do you then still hate those who separated you?"</p>

<p id="id07134">"I hate them? Not at all; why should I?" The countess placed herself
before Monte Cristo, still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed
grapes. "Take some," she said. "Madame, I never eat Muscatel grapes,"
replied Monte Cristo, as if the subject had not been mentioned before.
The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket, with a gesture
of despair. "Inflexible man!" she murmured. Monte Cristo remained as
unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him. Albert at
this moment ran in. "Oh, mother," he exclaimed, "such a misfortune has
happened!"</p>

<p id="id07135">"What? What has happened?" asked the countess, as though awakening from
a sleep to the realities of life; "did you say a misfortune? Indeed, I
should expect misfortunes."</p>

<p id="id07136">"M. de Villefort is here."</p>

<p id="id07137">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id07138">"He comes to fetch his wife and daughter."</p>

<p id="id07139">"Why so?"</p>

<p id="id07140">"Because Madame de Saint-Meran is just arrived in Paris, bringing the
news of M. de Saint-Meran's death, which took place on the first stage
after he left Marseilles. Madame de Villefort, who was in very good
spirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but
Mademoiselle Valentine, at the first words, guessed the whole truth,
notwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her
like a thunderbolt, and she fell senseless."</p>

<p id="id07141">"And how was M. de Saint-Meran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort?"
said the count.</p>

<p id="id07142">"He was her grandfather on the mother's side. He was coming here to
hasten her marriage with Franz."</p>

<p id="id07143">"Ah, indeed?"</p>

<p id="id07144">"So Franz must wait. Why was not M. de Saint-Meran also grandfather to<br>

Mademoiselle Danglars?"<br></p>

<p id="id07145">"Albert, Albert," said Madame de Morcerf, in a tone of mild reproof,
"what are you saying? Ah, count, he esteems you so highly, tell him that
he has spoken amiss." And she took two or three steps forward.
Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful, and so full of
affectionate admiration, that she turned back and grasped his hand; at
the same time she seized that of her son, and joined them together.</p>

<p id="id07146">"We are friends; are we not?" she asked.</p>

<p id="id07147">"Oh, madame, I do not presume to call myself your friend, but at all
times I am your most respectful servant." The countess left with an
indescribable pang in her heart, and before she had taken ten steps the
count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes. "Do not my mother and
you agree?" asked Albert, astonished.</p>

<p id="id07148">"On the contrary," replied the count, "did you not hear her declare that<br>

we were friends?" They re-entered the drawing-room, which Valentine and<br>

Madame de Villefort had just quitted. It is perhaps needless to add that<br>

Morrel departed almost at the same time.<br></p>

<h3 id="id07149" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-Meran.</h3>

<p id="id07150">A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort.
After the ladies had departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties
of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them,
the procureur had shut himself up in his study, according to his custom,
with a heap of papers calculated to alarm any one else, but which
generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires. But this time the
papers were a mere matter of form. Villefort had secluded himself, not
to study, but to reflect; and with the door locked and orders given that
he should not be disturbed excepting for important business, he sat down
in his arm-chair and began to ponder over the events, the remembrance of
which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy
thoughts and bitter recollections. Then, instead of plunging into the
mass of documents piled before him, he opened the drawer of his desk,
touched a spring, and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda, amongst
which he had carefully arranged, in characters only known to himself,
the names of all those who, either in his political career, in money
matters, at the bar, or in his mysterious love affairs, had become his
enemies.</p>

<p id="id07151">Their number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet
these names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile
with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from
the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the
almost impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has so
perilously climbed. When he had run over all these names in his memory,
again read and studied them, commenting meanwhile upon his lists, he
shook his head.</p>

<p id="id07152">"No," he murmured, "none of my enemies would have waited so patiently
and laboriously for so long a space of time, that they might now come
and crush me with this secret. Sometimes, as Hamlet says&#8212;</p>

<p id="id07153">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'Foul deeds will rise,<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tho' all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes;'<br></p>

<p id="id07154">but, like a phosphoric light, they rise but to mislead. The story has
been told by the Corsican to some priest, who in his turn has repeated
it. M. de Monte Cristo may have heard it, and to enlighten himself&#8212;but
why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject?" asked
Villefort, after a moment's reflection, "what interest can this M. de
Monte Cristo or M. Zaccone,&#8212;son of a shipowner of Malta, discoverer
of a mine in Thessaly, now visiting Paris for the first time,&#8212;what
interest, I say, can he take in discovering a gloomy, mysterious, and
useless fact like this? However, among all the incoherent details given
to me by the Abbe Busoni and by Lord Wilmore, by that friend and that
enemy, one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion&#8212;that in
no period, in no case, in no circumstance, could there have been any
contact between him and me."</p>

<p id="id07155">But Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe. He
dreaded not so much the revelation, for he could reply to or deny its
truth;&#8212;he cared little for that mene, tekel, upharsin, which appeared
suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;&#8212;but what he was really
anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them. While he
was endeavoring to calm his fears,&#8212;and instead of dwelling upon the
political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious
dreams, was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home, in
fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept,&#8212;the noise of a
carriage sounded in the yard, then he heard the steps of an aged person
ascending the stairs, followed by tears and lamentations, such as
servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in
their master's grief. He drew back the bolt of his door, and almost
directly an old lady entered, unannounced, carrying her shawl on her
arm, and her bonnet in her hand. The white hair was thrown back from her
yellow forehead, and her eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now
almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief. "Oh, sir,"
she said; "oh, sir, what a misfortune! I shall die of it; oh, yes, I
shall certainly die of it!"</p>

<p id="id07156">And then, falling upon the chair nearest the door, she burst into a
paroxysm of sobs. The servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to
approach nearer, were looking at Noirtier's old servant, who had heard
the noise from his master's room, and run there also, remaining behind
the others. Villefort rose, and ran towards his mother-in-law, for it
was she.</p>

<p id="id07157">"Why, what can have happened?" he exclaimed, "what has thus disturbed
you? Is M. de Saint-Meran with you?"</p>

<p id="id07158">"M. de Saint-Meran is dead," answered the old marchioness, without
preface and without expression; she appeared to be stupefied. Villefort
drew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed&#8212;"Dead!&#8212;so
suddenly?"</p>

<p id="id07159">"A week ago," continued Madame de Saint-Meran, "we went out together in
the carriage after dinner. M. de Saint-Meran had been unwell for some
days; still, the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him
with courage, and notwithstanding his illness he would leave. At six
leagues from Marseilles, after having eaten some of the lozenges he is
accustomed to take, he fell into such a deep sleep, that it appeared to
me unnatural; still I hesitated to wake him, although I fancied that
his face was flushed, and that the veins of his temples throbbed more
violently than usual. However, as it became dark, and I could no longer
see, I fell asleep; I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek, as from
a person suffering in his dreams, and he suddenly threw his head back
violently. I called the valet, I stopped the postilion, I spoke to M.
de Saint-Meran, I applied my smelling-salts; but all was over, and I
arrived at Aix by the side of a corpse." Villefort stood with his mouth
half open, quite stupefied.</p>

<p id="id07160">"Of course you sent for a doctor?"</p>

<p id="id07161">"Immediately; but, as I have told you, it was too late."</p>

<p id="id07162">"Yes; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had
died."</p>

<p id="id07163">"Oh, yes, sir, he told me; it appears to have been an apoplectic
stroke."</p>

<p id="id07164">"And what did you do then?"</p>

<p id="id07165">"M. de Saint-Meran had always expressed a desire, in case his death
happened during his absence from Paris, that his body might be brought
to the family vault. I had him put into a leaden coffin, and I am
preceding him by a few days."</p>

<p id="id07166">"Oh, my poor mother," said Villefort, "to have such duties to perform at
your age after such a blow!"</p>

<p id="id07167">"God has supported me through all; and then, my dear marquis, he would
certainly have done everything for me that I performed for him. It is
true that since I left him, I seem to have lost my senses. I cannot cry;
at my age they say that we have no more tears,&#8212;still I think that
when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping. Where
is Valentine, sir? It is on her account I am here; I wish to see
Valentine." Villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that
Valentine was at a ball; so he only said that she had gone out with her
step-mother, and that she should be fetched. "This instant, sir&#8212;this
instant, I beseech you!" said the old lady. Villefort placed the arm
of Madame de Saint-Meran within his own, and conducted her to his
apartment. "Rest yourself, mother," he said.</p>

<p id="id07168">The marchioness raised her head at this word, and beholding the man who
so forcibly reminded her of her deeply-regretted child, who still
lived for her in Valentine, she felt touched at the name of mother, and
bursting into tears, she fell on her knees before an arm-chair, where
she buried her venerable head. Villefort left her to the care of the
women, while old Barrois ran, half-scared, to his master; for nothing
frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over
them for a moment in order to strike some other old person. Then,
while Madame de Saint-Meran remained on her knees, praying fervently,
Villefort sent for a cab, and went himself to fetch his wife and
daughter from Madame de Morcerf's. He was so pale when he appeared at
the door of the ball-room, that Valentine ran to him, saying&#8212;</p>

<p id="id07169">"Oh, father, some misfortune has happened!"</p>

<p id="id07170">"Your grandmamma has just arrived, Valentine," said M. de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id07171">"And grandpapa?" inquired the young girl, trembling with apprehension.
M. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter. It was
just in time, for Valentine's head swam, and she staggered; Madame de
Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance, and aided her husband in
dragging her to the carriage, saying&#8212;"What a singular event! Who could
have thought it? Ah, yes, it is indeed strange!" And the wretched
family departed, leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of
the evening. At the foot of the stairs, Valentine found Barrois awaiting
her.</p>

<p id="id07172">"M. Noirtier wishes to see you to-night, he said, in an undertone.</p>

<p id="id07173">"Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma," she replied,
feeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be of the
most service just then was Madame de Saint-Meran. Valentine found her
grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung sobs, broken sighs,
burning tears, were all that passed in this sad interview, while Madame
de Villefort, leaning on her husband's arm, maintained all outward forms
of respect, at least towards the poor widow. She soon whispered to
her husband, "I think it would be better for me to retire, with
your permission, for the sight of me appears still to afflict your
mother-in-law." Madame de Saint-Meran heard her. "Yes, yes," she
said softly to Valentine, "let her leave; but do you stay." Madame de
Villefort left, and Valentine remained alone beside the bed, for the
procureur, overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death, had
followed his wife. Meanwhile, Barrois had returned for the first time to
old Noirtier, who having heard the noise in the house, had, as we have
said, sent his old servant to inquire the cause; on his return, his
quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger. "Alas, sir," exclaimed
Barrois, "a great misfortune has happened. Madame de Saint-Meran has
arrived, and her husband is dead!"</p>

<p id="id07174">M. de Saint-Meran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of
friendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably
affects another. Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest, apparently
overwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of inquiry.
"Mademoiselle Valentine?" Noirtier nodded his head. "She is at the
ball, as you know, since she came to say good-by to you in full dress."
Noirtier again closed his left eye. "Do you wish to see her?" Noirtier
again made an affirmative sign. "Well, they have gone to fetch her, no
doubt, from Madame de Morcerf's; I will await her return, and beg her to
come up here. Is that what you wish for?"</p>

<p id="id07175">"Yes," replied the invalid.</p>

<p id="id07176">Barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and informed
her of her grandfather's wish. Consequently, Valentine came up to
Noirtier, on leaving Madame de Saint-Meran, who in the midst of her
grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep.
Within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a
bottle of orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass. Then, as we have
said, the young girl left the bedside to see M. Noirtier. Valentine
kissed the old man, who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes
again filled with tears, whose sources he thought must be exhausted.
The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression.
"Yes, yes," said Valentine, "you mean that I have yet a kind grandfather
left, do you not." The old man intimated that such was his meaning.
"Ah, yes, happily I have," replied Valentine. "Without that, what would
become of me?"</p>

<p id="id07177">It was one o'clock in the morning. Barrois, who wished to go to bed
himself, observed that after such sad events every one stood in need of
rest. Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see
his child, but wished her good-night, for grief and fatigue had made her
appear quite ill. The next morning she found her grandmother in bed;
the fever had not abated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she
appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability. "Oh, dear
grandmamma, are you worse?" exclaimed Valentine, perceiving all these
signs of agitation.</p>

<p id="id07178">"No, my child, no," said Madame de Saint-Meran; "but I was impatiently
waiting for your arrival, that I might send for your father."</p>

<p id="id07179">"My father?" inquired Valentine, uneasily.</p>

<p id="id07180">"Yes, I wish to speak to him." Valentine durst not oppose her
grandmother's wish, the cause of which she did not know, and an instant
afterwards Villefort entered. "Sir," said Madame de Saint-Meran, without
using any circumlocution, and as if fearing she had no time to lose,
"you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child?"</p>

<p id="id07181">"Yes, madame," replied Villefort, "it is not only projected but
arranged."</p>

<p id="id07182">"Your intended son-in-law is named M. Franz d'Epinay?"</p>

<p id="id07183">"Yes, madame."</p>

<p id="id07184">"Is he not the son of General d'Epinay who was on our side, and who was
assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of
Elba?"</p>

<p id="id07185">"The same."</p>

<p id="id07186">"Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a<br>

Jacobin?"<br></p>

<p id="id07187">"Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother," said
Villefort; "M. d'Epinay was quite a child when his father died, he knows
very little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with pleasure, at
least with indifference."</p>

<p id="id07188">"Is it a suitable match?"</p>

<p id="id07189">"In every respect."</p>

<p id="id07190">"And the young man?"</p>

<p id="id07191">"Is regarded with universal esteem."</p>

<p id="id07192">"You approve of him?"</p>

<p id="id07193">"He is one of the most well-bred young men I know." During the whole
of this conversation Valentine had remained silent. "Well, sir," said
Madame de Saint-Meran, after a few minutes' reflection, "I must hasten
the marriage, for I have but a short time to live."</p>

<p id="id07194">"You, madame?" "You, dear mamma?" exclaimed M. de Villefort and<br>

Valentine at the same time.<br></p>

<p id="id07195">"I know what I am saying," continued the marchioness; "I must hurry you,
so that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a grandmother to
bless her marriage. I am all that is left to her belonging to my poor
Renee, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir."</p>

<p id="id07196">"Ah, madame," said Villefort, "you forget that I was obliged to give a
mother to my child."</p>

<p id="id07197">"A stepmother is never a mother, sir. But this is not to the
purpose,&#8212;our business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in
peace."</p>

<p id="id07198">All this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was something
in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium.</p>

<p id="id07199">"It shall be as you wish, madame," said Villefort; "more especially
since your wishes coincide with mine, and as soon as M. d'Epinay arrives
in Paris"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id07200">"My dear grandmother," interrupted Valentine, "consider decorum&#8212;the
recent death. You would not have me marry under such sad auspices?"</p>

<p id="id07201">"My child," exclaimed the old lady sharply, "let us hear none of the
conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the
future. I also was married at the death-bed of my mother, and certainly
I have not been less happy on that account."</p>

<p id="id07202">"Still that idea of death, madame," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id07203">"Still?&#8212;Always! I tell you I am going to die&#8212;do you understand? Well,
before dying, I wish to see my son-in-law. I wish to tell him to make
my child happy; I wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey
me;&#8212;in fact, I will know him&#8212;I will!" continued the old lady, with a
fearful expression, "that I may rise from the depths of my grave to find
him, if he should not fulfil his duty!"</p>

<p id="id07204">"Madame," said Villefort, "you must lay aside these exalted ideas, which
almost assume the appearance of madness. The dead, once buried in their
graves, rise no more."</p>

<p id="id07205">"And I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken. This night I have had a
fearful sleep. It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my
body, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and what
will appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes shut,
in the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner where
there is a door leading into Madame Villefort's dressing-room&#8212;I saw, I
tell you, silently enter, a white figure." Valentine screamed. "It was
the fever that disturbed you, madame," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id07206">"Doubt, if you please, but I am sure of what I say. I saw a white
figure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one
of my senses, I heard my glass removed&#8212;the same which is there now on
the table."</p>

<p id="id07207">"Oh, dear mother, it was a dream."</p>

<p id="id07208">"So little was it a dream, that I stretched my hand towards the bell;
but when I did so, the shade disappeared; my maid then entered with a
light."</p>

<p id="id07209">"But she saw no one?"</p>

<p id="id07210">"Phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them. It was the
soul of my husband!&#8212;Well, if my husband's soul can come to me, why
should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter? the tie is even
more direct, it seems to me."</p>

<p id="id07211">"Oh, madame," said Villefort, deeply affected, in spite of himself, "do
not yield to those gloomy thoughts; you will long live with us, happy,
loved, and honored, and we will make you forget"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id07212">"Never, never, never," said the marchioness. "When does M. d'Epinay
return?"</p>

<p id="id07213">"We expect him every moment."</p>

<p id="id07214">"It is well. As soon as he arrives inform me. We must be expeditious.
And then I also wish to see a notary, that I may be assured that all our
property returns to Valentine."</p>

<p id="id07215">"Ah, grandmamma," murmured Valentine, pressing her lips on the burning
brow, "do you wish to kill me? Oh, how feverish you are; we must not
send for a notary, but for a doctor."</p>

<p id="id07216">"A doctor?" said she, shrugging her shoulders, "I am not ill; I am
thirsty&#8212;that is all."</p>

<p id="id07217">"What are you drinking, dear grandmamma?"</p>

<p id="id07218">"The same as usual, my dear, my glass is there on the table&#8212;give it to
me, Valentine." Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it
to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread, for it was the same
glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre. The marchioness
drained the glass at a single draught, and then turned on her pillow,
repeating,&#8212;"The notary, the notary!"</p>

<p id="id07219">M. de Villefort left the room, and Valentine seated herself at the
bedside of her grandmother. The poor child appeared herself to require
the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative. A bright spot
burned in either cheek, her respiration was short and difficult, and her
pulse beat with feverish excitement. She was thinking of the despair
of Maximilian, when he should be informed that Madame de Saint-Meran,
instead of being an ally, was unconsciously acting as his enemy. More
than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother, and she would
not have hesitated a moment, if Maximilian Morrel had been named Albert
de Morcerf or Raoul de Chateau-Renaud; but Morrel was of plebeian
extraction, and Valentine knew how the haughty Marquise de Saint-Meran
despised all who were not noble. Her secret had each time been repressed
when she was about to reveal it, by the sad conviction that it would be
useless to do so; for, were it once discovered by her father and mother,
all would be lost. Two hours passed thus; Madame de Saint-Meran was in
a feverish sleep, and the notary had arrived. Though his coming was
announced in a very low tone, Madame de Saint-Meran arose from her
pillow. "The notary!" she exclaimed, "let him come in."</p>

<p id="id07220">The notary, who was at the door, immediately entered. "Go, Valentine,"
said Madame de Saint-Meran, "and leave me with this gentleman."</p>

<p id="id07221">"But, grandmamma"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id07222">"Leave me&#8212;go!" The young girl kissed her grandmother, and left with her
handkerchief to her eyes; at the door she found the valet de chambre,
who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining-room. Valentine
instantly ran down. The doctor was a friend of the family, and at
the same time one of the cleverest men of the day, and very fond of
Valentine, whose birth he had witnessed. He had himself a daughter about
her age, but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to
him from her mother having been consumptive.</p>

<p id="id07223">"Oh," said Valentine, "we have been waiting for you with such
impatience, dear M. d'Avrigny. But, first of all, how are Madeleine and
Antoinette?" Madeleine was the daughter of M. d'Avrigny, and Antoinette
his niece. M. d'Avrigny smiled sadly. "Antoinette is very well," he
said, "and Madeleine tolerably so. But you sent for me, my dear child.
It is not your father or Madame de Villefort who is ill. As for you,
although we doctors cannot divest our patients of nerves, I fancy you
have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your
imagination to take too wide a field." Valentine colored. M. d'Avrigny
carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent, for
he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the
mind. "No," she replied, "it is for my poor grandmother. You know the
calamity that has happened to us, do you not?"</p>

<p id="id07224">"I know nothing." said M. d'Avrigny.</p>

<p id="id07225">"Alas," said Valentine, restraining her tears, "my grandfather is dead."</p>

<p id="id07226">"M. de Saint-Meran?"</p>

<p id="id07227">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id07228">"Suddenly?"</p>

<p id="id07229">"From an apoplectic stroke."</p>

<p id="id07230">"An apoplectic stroke?" repeated the doctor.</p>

<p id="id07231">"Yes, and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband, whom she
never left, has called her, and that she must go and join him. Oh, M.
d'Avrigny, I beseech you, do something for her!"</p>

<p id="id07232">"Where is she?"</p>

<p id="id07233">"In her room with the notary."</p>

<p id="id07234">"And M. Noirtier?"</p>

<p id="id07235">"Just as he was, his mind perfectly clear, but the same incapability of
moving or speaking."</p>

<p id="id07236">"And the same love for you&#8212;eh, my dear child?"</p>

<p id="id07237">"Yes," said Valentine, "he was very fond of me."</p>

<p id="id07238">"Who does not love you?" Valentine smiled sadly. "What are your
grandmother's symptoms?"</p>

<p id="id07239">"An extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep; she
fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her
body, which she at the same time watched. It must have been delirium;
she fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even
heard the noise it made on touching her glass."</p>

<p id="id07240">"It is singular," said the doctor; "I was not aware that Madame de<br>

Saint-Meran was subject to such hallucinations."<br></p>

<p id="id07241">"It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition," said Valentine;
"and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her mad; and my
father, who you know is a strong-minded man, himself appeared deeply
impressed."</p>

<p id="id07242">"We will go and see," said the doctor; "what you tell me seems very
strange." The notary here descended, and Valentine was informed that her
grandmother was alone. "Go upstairs," she said to the doctor.</p>

<p id="id07243">"And you?"</p>

<p id="id07244">"Oh, I dare not&#8212;she forbade my sending for you; and, as you say, I am
myself agitated, feverish and out of sorts. I will go and take a turn in
the garden to recover myself." The doctor pressed Valentine's hand, and
while he visited her grandmother, she descended the steps. We need not
say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk. After remaining
for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house, and gathering
a rose to place in her waist or hair, she turned into the dark avenue
which led to the bench; then from the bench she went to the gate.
As usual, Valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers, but
without gathering them. The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming
this simple ornament, though she had not yet had time to put on the
outward semblance of woe. She then turned towards the avenue. As she
advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name. She stopped
astonished, then the voice reached her ear more distinctly, and she
recognized it to be that of Maximilian.</p>

<h3 id="id07245" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 73. The Promise.</h3>

<p id="id07246">It was, indeed, Maximilian Morrel, who had passed a wretched existence
since the previous day. With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had
anticipated after the return of Madame de Saint-Meran and the death
of the marquis, that something would occur at M. de Villefort's in
connection with his attachment for Valentine. His presentiments were
realized, as we shall see, and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him
pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut-trees. Valentine was
ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety, and as it was not his
accustomed hour for visiting her, she had gone to the spot simply by
accident or perhaps through sympathy. Morrel called her, and she ran
to the gate. "You here at this hour?" said she. "Yes, my poor girl,"
replied Morrel; "I come to bring and to hear bad tidings."</p>

<p id="id07247">"This is, indeed, a house of mourning," said Valentine; "speak,<br>

Maximilian, although the cup of sorrow seems already full."<br></p>

<p id="id07248">"Dear Valentine," said Morrel, endeavoring to conceal his own emotion,
"listen, I entreat you; what I am about to say is very serious. When are
you to be married?"</p>

<p id="id07249">"I will tell you all," said Valentine; "from you I have nothing
to conceal. This morning the subject was introduced, and my dear
grandmother, on whom I depended as my only support, not only declared
herself favorable to it, but is so anxious for it, that they only await
the arrival of M. d'Epinay, and the following day the contract will
be signed." A deep sigh escaped the young man, who gazed long and
mournfully at her he loved. "Alas," replied he, "it is dreadful thus to
hear my condemnation from your own lips. The sentence is passed, and, in
a few hours, will be executed; it must be so, and I will not endeavor
to prevent it. But, since you say nothing remains but for M. d'Epinay to
arrive that the contract may be signed, and the following day you will
be his, to-morrow you will be engaged to M. d'Epinay, for he came this
morning to Paris." Valentine uttered a cry.</p>

<p id="id07250">"I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since," said Morrel; "we
were speaking, he of the sorrow your family had experienced, and I of
your grief, when a carriage rolled into the court-yard. Never, till
then, had I placed any confidence in presentiments, but now I cannot
help believing them, Valentine. At the sound of that carriage I
shuddered; soon I heard steps on the staircase, which terrified me as
much as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan. The door at last
opened; Albert de Morcerf entered first, and I began to hope my fears
were vain, when, after him, another young man advanced, and the count
exclaimed&#8212;'Ah, here is the Baron Franz d'Epinay!' I summoned all my
strength and courage to my support. Perhaps I turned pale and trembled,
but certainly I smiled; and five minutes after I left, without having
heard one word that had passed."</p>

<p id="id07251">"Poor Maximilian!" murmured Valentine.</p>

<p id="id07252">"Valentine, the time has arrived when you must answer me. And remember
my life depends on your answer. What do you intend doing?" Valentine
held down her head; she was overwhelmed.</p>

<p id="id07253">"Listen," said Morrel; "it is not the first time you have contemplated
our present position, which is a serious and urgent one; I do not think
it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that for those who
like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret. There
are such in the world, and God will doubtless reward them in heaven for
their resignation on earth, but those who mean to contend must not lose
one precious moment, but must return immediately the blow which fortune
strikes. Do you intend to struggle against our ill-fortune? Tell me,
Valentine for it is that I came to know."</p>

<p id="id07254">Valentine trembled, and looked at him with amazement. The idea of
resisting her father, her grandmother, and all the family, had never
occurred to her. "What do you say, Maximilian?" asked Valentine. "What
do you mean by a struggle? Oh, it would be a sacrilege. What? I resist
my father's order, and my dying grandmother's wish? Impossible!" Morrel
started. "You are too noble not to understand me, and you understand me
so well that you already yield, dear Maximilian. No, no; I shall need
all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret,
as you say. But to grieve my father&#8212;to disturb my grandmother's last
moments&#8212;never!"</p>

<p id="id07255">"You are right," said Morrel, calmly.</p>

<p id="id07256">"In what a tone you speak!" cried Valentine.</p>

<p id="id07257">"I speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle."</p>

<p id="id07258">"Mademoiselle," cried Valentine; "mademoiselle! Oh, selfish man,&#8212;he
sees me in despair, and pretends he cannot understand me!"</p>

<p id="id07259">"You mistake&#8212;I understand you perfectly. You will not oppose M.
Villefort, you will not displease the marchioness, and to-morrow you
will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband."</p>
