<p id="id09143">The count, in his survey of the pit, encountered a pale face and
threatening eyes, which evidently sought to gain his attention. He
recognized Albert, but thought it better not to notice him, as he looked
so angry and discomposed. Without communicating his thoughts to his
companion, he sat down, drew out his opera-glass, and looked another
way. Although apparently not noticing Albert, he did not, however, lose
sight of him, and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act, he
saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends. Then his head was
seen passing at the back of the boxes, and the count knew that the
approaching storm was intended to fall on him. He was at the moment
conversing cheerfully with Morrel, but he was well prepared for what
might happen. The door opened, and Monte Cristo, turning round, saw
Albert, pale and trembling, followed by Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id09144">"Well," cried he, with that benevolent politeness which distinguished
his salutation from the common civilities of the world, "my cavalier has
attained his object. Good-evening, M. de Morcerf." The countenance of
this man, who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings,
expressed the most perfect cordiality. Morrel only then recollected the
letter he had received from the viscount, in which, without assigning
any reason, he begged him to go to the opera, but he understood that
something terrible was brooding.</p>

<p id="id09145">"We are not come here, sir, to exchange hypocritical expressions of
politeness, or false professions of friendship," said Albert, "but to
demand an explanation." The young man's trembling voice was scarcely
audible. "An explanation at the opera?" said the count, with that calm
tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause
is good. "Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians, I
should not have thought this the place for such a demand."</p>

<p id="id09146">"Still, if people will shut themselves up," said Albert, "and cannot
be seen because they are bathing, dining, or asleep, we must avail
ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen."</p>

<p id="id09147">"I am not difficult of access, sir; for yesterday, if my memory does not
deceive me, you were at my house."</p>

<p id="id09148">"Yesterday I was at your house, sir," said the young man; "because then
I knew not who you were." In pronouncing these words Albert had raised
his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the
lobby. Thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation.
"Where are you come from, sir? You do not appear to be in the possession
of your senses."</p>

<p id="id09149">"Provided I understand your perfidy, sir, and succeed in making you
understand that I will be revenged, I shall be reasonable enough," said
Albert furiously.</p>

<p id="id09150">"I do not understand you, sir," replied Monte Cristo; "and if I did,
your tone is too high. I am at home here, and I alone have a right
to raise my voice above another's. Leave the box, sir!" Monte Cristo
pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity. "Ah, I shall
know how to make you leave your home!" replied Albert, clasping in his
convulsed grasp the glove, which Monte Cristo did not lose sight of.</p>

<p id="id09151">"Well, well," said Monte Cristo quietly, "I see you wish to quarrel with
me; but I would give you one piece of advice, which you will do well
to keep in mind. It is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge.
Display is not becoming to every one, M. de Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id09152">At this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of
spectators of this scene. They had talked of no one but Morcerf the
whole day. Albert understood the allusion in a moment, and was about
to throw his glove at the count, when Morrel seized his hand, while
Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud, fearing the scene would surpass the limits
of a challenge, held him back. But Monte Cristo, without rising, and
leaning forward in his chair, merely stretched out his arm and, taking
the damp, crushed glove from the clinched hand of the young man, "Sir,"
said he in a solemn tone, "I consider your glove thrown, and will return
it to you wrapped around a bullet. Now leave me or I will summon my
servants to throw you out at the door."</p>

<p id="id09153">Wild, almost unconscious, and with eyes inflamed, Albert stepped back,
and Morrel closed the door. Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if
nothing had happened; his face was like marble, and his heart was like
bronze. Morrel whispered, "What have you done to him?"</p>

<p id="id09154">"I? Nothing&#8212;at least personally," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09155">"But there must be some cause for this strange scene."</p>

<p id="id09156">"The Count of Morcerf's adventure exasperates the young man."</p>

<p id="id09157">"Have you anything to do with it?"</p>

<p id="id09158">"It was through Haidee that the Chamber was informed of his father's
treason."</p>

<p id="id09159">"Indeed?" said Morrel. "I had been told, but would not credit it, that
the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the
daughter of Ali Pasha."</p>

<p id="id09160">"It is true, nevertheless."</p>

<p id="id09161">"Then," said Morrel, "I understand it all, and this scene was
premeditated."</p>

<p id="id09162">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id09163">"Yes. Albert wrote to request me to come to the opera, doubtless that I
might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you."</p>

<p id="id09164">"Probably," said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity.</p>

<p id="id09165">"But what shall you do with him?"</p>

<p id="id09166">"With whom?"</p>

<p id="id09167">"With Albert."</p>

<p id="id09168">"What shall I do with Albert? As certainly, Maximilian, as I now press
your hand, I shall kill him before ten o'clock to-morrow morning."
Morrel, in his turn, took Monte Cristo's hand in both of his, and he
shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was.</p>

<p id="id09169">"Ah, Count," said he, "his father loves him so much!"</p>

<p id="id09170">"Do not speak to me of that," said Monte Cristo, with the first movement
of anger he had betrayed; "I will make him suffer." Morrel, amazed, let
fall Monte Cristo's hand. "Count, count!" said he.</p>

<p id="id09171">"Dear Maximilian," interrupted the count, "listen how adorably Duprez is
singing that line,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09172">     'O Mathilde! idole de mon ame!'</p>

<p id="id09173">"I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples, and the first to
applaud him. Bravo, bravo!" Morrel saw it was useless to say more, and
refrained. The curtain, which had risen at the close of the scene with
Albert, again fell, and a rap was heard at the door.</p>

<p id="id09174">"Come in," said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the
least emotion; and immediately Beauchamp appeared. "Good-evening, M.
Beauchamp," said Monte Cristo, as if this was the first time he had seen
the journalist that evening; "be seated."</p>

<p id="id09175">Beauchamp bowed, and, sitting down, "Sir," said he, "I just now
accompanied M. de Morcerf, as you saw."</p>

<p id="id09176">"And that means," replied Monte Cristo, laughing, "that you had,
probably, just dined together. I am happy to see, M. Beauchamp, that you
are more sober than he was."</p>

<p id="id09177">"Sir," said M. Beauchamp, "Albert was wrong, I acknowledge, to betray
so much anger, and I come, on my own account, to apologize for him. And
having done so, entirely on my own account, be it understood, I would
add that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some
explanation concerning your connection with Yanina. Then I will add
two words about the young Greek girl." Monte Cristo motioned him to be
silent. "Come," said he, laughing, "there are all my hopes about to be
destroyed."</p>

<p id="id09178">"How so?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id09179">"Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character. I am,
in your opinion, a Lara, a Manfred, a Lord Ruthven; then, just as I am
arriving at the climax, you defeat your own end, and seek to make an
ordinary man of me. You bring me down to your own level, and demand
explanations! Indeed, M. Beauchamp, it is quite laughable."</p>

<p id="id09180">"Yet," replied Beauchamp haughtily, "there are occasions when probity
commands"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09181">"M. Beauchamp," interposed this strange man, "the Count of Monte Cristo
bows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo himself. Say no more, I
entreat you. I do what I please, M. Beauchamp, and it is always well
done."</p>

<p id="id09182">"Sir," replied the young man, "honest men are not to be paid with such
coin. I require honorable guaranties."</p>

<p id="id09183">"I am, sir, a living guaranty," replied Monte Cristo, motionless, but
with a threatening look; "we have both blood in our veins which we wish
to shed&#8212;that is our mutual guaranty. Tell the viscount so, and that
to-morrow, before ten o'clock, I shall see what color his is."</p>

<p id="id09184">"Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel," said Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id09185">"It is quite immaterial to me," said Monte Cristo, "and it was very
unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle. In France
people fight with the sword or pistol, in the colonies with the carbine,
in Arabia with the dagger. Tell your client that, although I am the
insulted party, in order to carry out my eccentricity, I leave him the
choice of arms, and will accept without discussion, without dispute,
anything, even combat by drawing lots, which is always stupid, but with
me different from other people, as I am sure to gain."</p>

<p id="id09186">"Sure to gain!" repeated Beauchamp, looking with amazement at the count.</p>

<p id="id09187">"Certainly," said Monte Cristo, slightly shrugging his shoulders;
"otherwise I would not fight with M. de Morcerf. I shall kill him&#8212;I
cannot help it. Only by a single line this evening at my house let me
know the arms and the hour; I do not like to be kept waiting."</p>

<p id="id09188">"Pistols, then, at eight o'clock, in the Bois de Vincennes," said
Beauchamp, quite disconcerted, not knowing if he was dealing with an
arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being.</p>

<p id="id09189">"Very well, sir," said Monte Cristo. "Now all that is settled, do let
me see the performance, and tell your friend Albert not to come any more
this evening; he will hurt himself with all his ill-chosen barbarisms:
let him go home and go to sleep." Beauchamp left the box, perfectly
amazed. "Now," said Monte Cristo, turning towards Morrel, "I may depend
upon you, may I not?"</p>

<p id="id09190">"Certainly," said Morrel, "I am at your service, count; still"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09191">"What?"</p>

<p id="id09192">"It is desirable I should know the real cause."</p>

<p id="id09193">"That is to say, you would rather not?"</p>

<p id="id09194">"No."</p>

<p id="id09195">"The young man himself is acting blindfolded, and knows not the true
cause, which is known only to God and to me; but I give you my word,
Morrel, that God, who does know it, will be on our side."</p>

<p id="id09196">"Enough," said Morrel; "who is your second witness?"</p>

<p id="id09197">"I know no one in Paris, Morrel, on whom I could confer that honor
besides you and your brother Emmanuel. Do you think Emmanuel would
oblige me?"</p>

<p id="id09198">"I will answer for him, count."</p>

<p id="id09199">"Well? that is all I require. To-morrow morning, at seven o'clock, you
will be with me, will you not?"</p>

<p id="id09200">"We will."</p>

<p id="id09201">"Hush, the curtain is rising. Listen! I never lose a note of this opera
if I can avoid it; the music of William Tell is so sweet."</p>

<h3 id="id09202" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 89. A Nocturnal Interview.</h3>

<p id="id09203">Monte Cristo waited, according to his usual custom, until Duprez had
sung his famous "Suivez-moi;" then he rose and went out. Morrel took
leave of him at the door, renewing his promise to be with him the next
morning at seven o'clock, and to bring Emmanuel. Then he stepped into
his coupe, calm and smiling, and was at home in five minutes. No one who
knew the count could mistake his expression when, on entering, he said,
"Ali, bring me my pistols with the ivory cross."</p>

<p id="id09204">Ali brought the box to his master, who examined the weapons with a
solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a
little powder and shot. These were pistols of an especial pattern, which
Monte Cristo had had made for target practice in his own room. A cap was
sufficient to drive out the bullet, and from the adjoining room no one
would have suspected that the count was, as sportsmen would say, keeping
his hand in. He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim
at on a little iron plate which served him as a target, when his study
door opened, and Baptistin entered. Before he had spoken a word, the
count saw in the next room a veiled woman, who had followed closely
after Baptistin, and now, seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and
swords on the table, rushed in. Baptistin looked at his master, who made
a sign to him, and he went out, closing the door after him. "Who are
you, madame?" said the count to the veiled woman.</p>

<p id="id09205">The stranger cast one look around her, to be certain that they were
quite alone; then bending as if she would have knelt, and joining her
hands, she said with an accent of despair, "Edmond, you will not kill my
son?" The count retreated a step, uttered a slight exclamation, and let
fall the pistol he held. "What name did you pronounce then, Madame de
Morcerf?" said he. "Yours!" cried she, throwing back her veil,&#8212;"yours,
which I alone, perhaps, have not forgotten. Edmond, it is not Madame de
Morcerf who is come to you, it is Mercedes."</p>

<p id="id09206">"Mercedes is dead, madame," said Monte Cristo; "I know no one now of
that name."</p>

<p id="id09207">"Mercedes lives, sir, and she remembers, for she alone recognized
you when she saw you, and even before she saw you, by your voice,
Edmond,&#8212;by the simple sound of your voice; and from that moment she
has followed your steps, watched you, feared you, and she needs not to
inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes M. de Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id09208">"Fernand, do you mean?" replied Monte Cristo, with bitter irony; "since
we are recalling names, let us remember them all." Monte Cristo had
pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that
Mercedes felt a thrill of horror run through every vein. "You see,
Edmond, I am not mistaken, and have cause to say, 'Spare my son!'"</p>

<p id="id09209">"And who told you, madame, that I have any hostile intentions against
your son?"</p>

<p id="id09210">"No one, in truth; but a mother has twofold sight. I guessed all; I
followed him this evening to the opera, and, concealed in a parquet box,
have seen all."</p>

<p id="id09211">"If you have seen all, madame, you know that the son of Fernand has
publicly insulted me," said Monte Cristo with awful calmness.</p>

<p id="id09212">"Oh, for pity's sake!"</p>

<p id="id09213">"You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel,
one of my friends, had not stopped him."</p>

<p id="id09214">"Listen to me, my son has also guessed who you are,&#8212;he attributes his
father's misfortunes to you."</p>

<p id="id09215">"Madame, you are mistaken, they are not misfortunes,&#8212;it is a
punishment. It is not I who strike M. de Morcerf; it is providence which
punishes him."</p>

<p id="id09216">"And why do you represent providence?" cried Mercedes. "Why do you
remember when it forgets? What are Yanina and its vizier to you, Edmond?
What injury his Fernand Mondego done you in betraying Ali Tepelini?"</p>

<p id="id09217">"Ah, madame," replied Monte Cristo, "all this is an affair between the
French captain and the daughter of Vasiliki. It does not concern me,
you are right; and if I have sworn to revenge myself, it is not on the
French captain, or the Count of Morcerf, but on the fisherman Fernand,
the husband of Mercedes the Catalane."</p>

<p id="id09218">"Ah, sir!" cried the countess, "how terrible a vengeance for a fault
which fatality made me commit!&#8212;for I am the only culprit, Edmond, and
if you owe revenge to any one, it is to me, who had not fortitude to
bear your absence and my solitude."</p>

<p id="id09219">"But," exclaimed Monte Cristo, "why was I absent? And why were you
alone?"</p>

<p id="id09220">"Because you had been arrested, Edmond, and were a prisoner."</p>

<p id="id09221">"And why was I arrested? Why was I a prisoner?"</p>

<p id="id09222">"I do not know," said Mercedes. "You do not, madame; at least, I hope
not. But I will tell you. I was arrested and became a prisoner because,
under the arbor of La Reserve, the day before I was to marry you, a man
named Danglars wrote this letter, which the fisherman Fernand himself
posted." Monte Cristo went to a secretary, opened a drawer by a spring,
from which he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the
ink of which had become of a rusty hue&#8212;this he placed in the hands
of Mercedes. It was Danglars' letter to the king's attorney, which the
Count of Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson &amp;
French, had taken from the file against Edmond Dantes, on the day he
had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville. Mercedes read
with terror the following lines:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09223">"The king's attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion
that one Edmond Dantes, second in command on board the Pharaon, this day
arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo,
is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and of another
letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample
corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the
above-mentioned Edmond Dantes, who either carries the letter for Paris
about with him, or has it at his father's abode. Should it not be
found in possession of either father or son, then it will assuredly
be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantes on board the
Pharaon."</p>

<p id="id09224">"How dreadful!" said Mercedes, passing her hand across her brow, moist
with perspiration; "and that letter"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09225">"I bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame," said Monte
Cristo; "but that is a trifle, since it enables me to justify myself to
you."</p>

<p id="id09226">"And the result of that letter"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09227">"You well know, madame, was my arrest; but you do not know how long that
arrest lasted. You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within
a quarter of a league of you, in a dungeon in the Chateau d'If. You do
not know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the vow of
vengeance which I had made the first day; and yet I was not aware that
you had married Fernand, my calumniator, and that my father had died of
hunger!"</p>

<p id="id09228">"Can it be?" cried Mercedes, shuddering.</p>

<p id="id09229">"That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had
entered it; and that is why, on account of the living Mercedes and my
deceased father, I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand, and&#8212;I have
revenged myself."</p>

<p id="id09230">"And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that?"</p>

<p id="id09231">"I am satisfied, madame, that he did what I have told you; besides, that
is not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should pass
over to the English; that a Spaniard by birth should have fought against
the Spaniards; that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed and
murdered Ali. Compared with such things, what is the letter you have
just read?&#8212;a lover's deception, which the woman who has married that
man ought certainly to forgive; but not so the lover who was to have
married her. Well, the French did not avenge themselves on the traitor,
the Spaniards did not shoot the traitor, Ali in his tomb left the
traitor unpunished; but I, betrayed, sacrificed, buried, have risen from
my tomb, by the grace of God, to punish that man. He sends me for that
purpose, and here I am." The poor woman's head and arms fell; her legs
bent under her, and she fell on her knees. "Forgive, Edmond, forgive for
my sake, who love you still!"</p>

<p id="id09232">The dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother.
Her forehead almost touched the carpet, when the count sprang forward
and raised her. Then seated on a chair, she looked at the manly
countenance of Monte Cristo, on which grief and hatred still impressed
a threatening expression. "Not crush that accursed race?" murmured he;
"abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment? Impossible,
madame, impossible!"</p>

<p id="id09233">"Edmond," said the poor mother, who tried every means, "when I call you<br>

Edmond, why do you not call me Mercedes?"<br></p>

<p id="id09234">"Mercedes!" repeated Monte Cristo; "Mercedes! Well yes, you are right;
that name has still its charms, and this is the first time for a long
period that I have pronounced it so distinctly. Oh, Mercedes, I have
uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy, with the groan of sorrow,
with the last effort of despair; I have uttered it when frozen with
cold, crouched on the straw in my dungeon; I have uttered it, consumed
with heat, rolling on the stone floor of my prison. Mercedes, I must
revenge myself, for I suffered fourteen years,&#8212;fourteen years I wept, I
cursed; now I tell you, Mercedes, I must revenge myself."</p>

<p id="id09235">The count, fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently
loved, called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred. "Revenge
yourself, then, Edmond," cried the poor mother; "but let your vengeance
fall on the culprits,&#8212;on him, on me, but not on my son!"</p>

<p id="id09236">"It is written in the good book," said Monte Cristo, "that the sins
of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth
generation. Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet, why
should I seek to make myself better than God?"</p>

<p id="id09237">"Edmond," continued Mercedes, with her arms extended towards the count,
"since I first knew you, I have adored your name, have respected your
memory. Edmond, my friend, do not compel me to tarnish that noble and
pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart. Edmond, if
you knew all the prayers I have addressed to God for you while I thought
you were living and since I have thought you must be dead! Yes, dead,
alas! I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower,
or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers, and I wept! What
could I do for you, Edmond, besides pray and weep? Listen; for ten
years I dreamed each night the same dream. I had been told that you had
endeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner;
that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you had
been thrown alive from the top of the Chateau d'If, and that the cry you
uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that
they were your murderers. Well, Edmond, I swear to you, by the head
of that son for whom I entreat your pity,&#8212;Edmond, for ten years I saw
every night every detail of that frightful tragedy, and for ten years
I heard every night the cry which awoke me, shuddering and cold. And
I, too, Edmond&#8212;oh! believe me&#8212;guilty as I was&#8212;oh, yes, I, too, have
suffered much!"</p>

<p id="id09238">"Have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your
absence?" cried Monte Cristo, thrusting his hands into his hair; "have
you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival, while you
were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon?"</p>

<p id="id09239">"No," interrupted Mercedes, "but I have seen him whom I loved on the
point of murdering my son." Mercedes uttered these words with such deep
anguish, with an accent of such intense despair, that Monte Cristo could
not restrain a sob. The lion was daunted; the avenger was conquered.
"What do you ask of me?" said he,&#8212;"your son's life? Well, he shall
live!" Mercedes uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte
Cristo's eyes; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously, for,
doubtless, God had sent some angel to collect them&#8212;far more precious
were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of Guzerat and Ophir.</p>

<p id="id09240">"Oh," said she, seizing the count's hand and raising it to her lips;
"oh, thank you, thank you, Edmond! Now you are exactly what I dreamt you
were,&#8212;the man I always loved. Oh, now I may say so!"</p>

<p id="id09241">"So much the better," replied Monte Cristo; "as that poor Edmond will
not have long to be loved by you. Death is about to return to the tomb,
the phantom to retire in darkness."</p>

<p id="id09242">"What do you say, Edmond?"</p>

<p id="id09243">"I say, since you command me, Mercedes, I must die."</p>

<p id="id09244">"Die? and why so? Who talks of dying? Whence have you these ideas of
death?"</p>

<p id="id09245">"You do not suppose that, publicly outraged in the face of a
whole theatre, in the presence of your friends and those of your
son&#8212;challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were
a victory&#8212;you do not suppose that I can for one moment wish to live.
What I most loved after you, Mercedes, was myself, my dignity, and that
strength which rendered me superior to other men; that strength was my
life. With one word you have crushed it, and I die."</p>

<p id="id09246">"But the duel will not take place, Edmond, since you forgive?"</p>

<p id="id09247">"It will take place," said Monte Cristo, in a most solemn tone; "but
instead of your son's blood to stain the ground, mine will flow."
Mercedes shrieked, and sprang towards Monte Cristo, but, suddenly
stopping, "Edmond," said she, "there is a God above us, since you live
and since I have seen you again; I trust to him from my heart. While
waiting his assistance I trust to your word; you have said that my son
should live, have you not?"</p>

<p id="id09248">"Yes, madame, he shall live," said Monte Cristo, surprised that without
more emotion Mercedes had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her.
Mercedes extended her hand to the count.</p>

<p id="id09249">"Edmond," said she, and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at
him to whom she spoke, "how noble it is of you, how great the action you
have just performed, how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who
appealed to you with every chance against her, Alas, I am grown old with
grief more than with years, and cannot now remind my Edmond by a smile,
or by a look, of that Mercedes whom he once spent so many hours in
contemplating. Ah, believe me, Edmond, as I told you, I too have
suffered much; I repeat, it is melancholy to pass one's life without
having one joy to recall, without preserving a single hope; but that
proves that all is not yet over. No, it is not finished; I feel it by
what remains in my heart. Oh, I repeat it, Edmond; what you have just
done is beautiful&#8212;it is grand; it is sublime."</p>

<p id="id09250">"Do you say so now, Mercedes?&#8212;then what would you say if you knew the
extent of the sacrifice I make to you? Suppose that the Supreme Being,
after having created the world and fertilized chaos, had paused in the
work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins
from her immortal eyes; suppose that when everything was in readiness
and the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see that it
was good&#8212;suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back
into eternal night&#8212;then&#8212;even then, Mercedes, you could not imagine
what I lose in sacrificing my life at this moment." Mercedes looked at
the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment,
her admiration, and her gratitude. Monte Cristo pressed his forehead on
his burning hands, as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight
of its thoughts. "Edmond," said Mercedes, "I have but one word more to
say to you." The count smiled bitterly. "Edmond," continued she, "you
will see that if my face is pale, if my eyes are dull, if my beauty is
gone; if Mercedes, in short, no longer resembles her former self in her
features, you will see that her heart is still the same. Adieu, then,
Edmond; I have nothing more to ask of heaven&#8212;I have seen you again,
and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were. Adieu,
Edmond, adieu, and thank you."</p>

<p id="id09251">But the count did not answer. Mercedes opened the door of the study and
had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound
revery into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him. The clock
of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame
de Morcerf away rolled on the pavement of the Champs-Elysees, and made
Monte Cristo raise his head. "What a fool I was," said he, "not to tear
my heart out on the day when I resolved to avenge myself!"</p>

<h3 id="id09252" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 90. The Meeting.</h3>

<p id="id09253">After Mercedes had left Monte Cristo, he fell into profound gloom.
Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped;
his energetic mind slumbered, as the body does after extreme fatigue.
"What?" said he to himself, while the lamp and the wax lights were
nearly burnt out, and the servants were waiting impatiently in the
anteroom; "what? this edifice which I have been so long preparing, which
I have reared with so much care and toil, is to be crushed by a single
touch, a word, a breath! Yes, this self, of whom I thought so much, of
whom I was so proud, who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of
the Chateau d'If, and whom I had succeeded in making so great, will be
but a lump of clay to-morrow. Alas, it is not the death of the body I
regret; for is not the destruction of the vital principle, the repose to
which everything is tending, to which every unhappy being aspires,&#8212;is
not this the repose of matter after which I so long sighed, and which
I was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when Faria
appeared in my dungeon? What is death for me? One step farther into
rest,&#8212;two, perhaps, into silence.</p>

<p id="id09254">"No, it is not existence, then, that I regret, but the ruin of projects
so slowly carried out, so laboriously framed. Providence is now opposed
to them, when I most thought it would be propitious. It is not God's
will that they should be accomplished. This burden, almost as heavy as a
world, which I had raised, and I had thought to bear to the end, was too
great for my strength, and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle
of my career. Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen
years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence?
And all this&#8212;all this, because my heart, which I thought dead, was only
sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again, because
I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a
woman's voice. Yet," continued the count, becoming each moment more
absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow,
which Mercedes had accepted, "yet, it is impossible that so noble-minded
a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in
the prime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to
such a point maternal love, or rather delirium. There are virtues which
become crimes by exaggeration. No, she must have conceived some pathetic
scene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what would be
sublime here will there appear ridiculous." The blush of pride mounted
to the count's forehead as this thought passed through his mind.
"Ridiculous?" repeated he; "and the ridicule will fall on me. I
ridiculous? No, I would rather die."</p>

<p id="id09255">By thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill-fortune of the
next day, to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercedes to
spare her son, the count at last exclaimed, "Folly, folly, folly!&#8212;to
carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man
to aim at. He will never believe that my death was suicide; and yet it
is important for the honor of my memory,&#8212;and this surely is not vanity,
but a justifiable pride,&#8212;it is important the world should know that
I have consented, by my free will, to stop my arm, already raised to
strike, and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others
I have struck myself. It must be; it shall be."</p>

<p id="id09256">Seizing a pen, he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk, and
wrote at the bottom of the document (which was no other than his will,
made since his arrival in Paris) a sort of codicil, clearly explaining
the nature of his death. "I do this, O my God," said he, with his eyes
raised to heaven, "as much for thy honor as for mine. I have during ten
years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance, and other wretches,
like Morcerf, Danglars, Villefort, even Morcerf himself, must not
imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy. Let them know,
on the contrary, that their punishment, which had been decreed by
providence, is only delayed by my present determination, and although
they escape it in this world, it awaits them in another, and that they
are only exchanging time for eternity."</p>

<p id="id09257">While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,&#8212;wretched waking
dreams of grief,&#8212;the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and
shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his
justification of providence. It was just five o'clock in the morning
when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear. He turned his
head, looked around him, and saw no one; but the sound was repeated
distinctly enough to convince him of its reality.</p>

<p id="id09258">He arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw Haidee,
who had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful
head thrown back. She had been standing at the door, to prevent his
going out without seeing her, until sleep, which the young cannot
resist, had overpowered her frame, wearied as she was with watching. The
noise of the door did not awaken her, and Monte Cristo gazed at her with
affectionate regret. "She remembered that she had a son," said he; "and
I forgot I had a daughter." Then, shaking his head sorrowfully, "Poor
Haidee," said he; "she wished to see me, to speak to me; she has feared
or guessed something. Oh, I cannot go without taking leave of her; I
cannot die without confiding her to some one." He quietly regained his
seat, and wrote under the other lines:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09259">"I bequeath to Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis,&#8212;and son of my
former patron, Pierre Morrel, shipowner at Marseilles,&#8212;the sum of
twenty millions, a part of which may be offered to his sister Julia and
brother-in-law Emmanuel, if he does not fear this increase of fortune
may mar their happiness. These twenty millions are concealed in my
grotto at Monte Cristo, of which Bertuccio knows the secret. If his
heart is free, and he will marry Haidee, the daughter of Ali Pasha of
Yanina, whom I have brought up with the love of a father, and who
has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me, he will thus
accomplish my last wish. This will has already constituted Haidee
heiress of the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, funds in
England, Austria, and Holland, furniture in my different palaces and
houses, and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my
servants, may still amount to sixty millions."</p>

<p id="id09260">He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start, and
the pen fell from his hand. "Haidee," said he, "did you read it?"</p>

<p id="id09261">"Oh, my lord," said she, "why are you writing thus at such an hour? Why
are you bequeathing all your fortune to me? Are you going to leave me?"</p>

<p id="id09262">"I am going on a journey, dear child," said Monte Cristo, with an
expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy; "and if any misfortune
should happen to me."</p>

<p id="id09263">The count stopped. "Well?" asked the young girl, with an authoritative
tone the count had never observed before, and which startled him.
"Well, if any misfortune happen to me," replied Monte Cristo, "I wish
my daughter to be happy." Haidee smiled sorrowfully, and shook her head.
"Do you think of dying, my lord?" said she.</p>

<p id="id09264">"The wise man, my child, has said, 'It is good to think of death.'"</p>

<p id="id09265">"Well, if you die," said she, "bequeath your fortune to others, for if
you die I shall require nothing;" and, taking the paper, she tore it in
four pieces, and threw it into the middle of the room. Then, the effort
having exhausted her strength, she fell not asleep this time, but
fainting on the floor. The count leaned over her and raised her in his
arms; and seeing that sweet pale face, those lovely eyes closed, that
beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless, the idea
occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise
than as a daughter loves a father.</p>

<p id="id09266">"Alas," murmured he, with intense suffering, "I might, then, have been
happy yet." Then he carried Haidee to her room, resigned her to the care
of her attendants, and returning to his study, which he shut quickly
this time, he again copied the destroyed will. As he was finishing,
the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard. Monte Cristo
approached the window, and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel alight. "Good,"
said he; "it was time,"&#8212;and he sealed his will with three seals. A
moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room, and went to open
the door himself. Morrel was there; he had come twenty minutes before
the time appointed. "I am perhaps come too soon, count," said he, "but
I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night, nor
has any one in my house. I need to see you strong in your courageous
assurance, to recover myself." Monte Cristo could not resist this proof
of affection; he not only extended his hand to the young man, but flew
to him with open arms. "Morrel," said he, "it is a happy day for me, to
feel that I am beloved by such a man as you. Good-morning, Emmanuel; you
will come with me then, Maximilian?"</p>

<p id="id09267">"Did you doubt it?" said the young captain.</p>

<p id="id09268">"But if I were wrong"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09269">"I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday; I
have been thinking of your firmness all night, and I said to myself that
justice must be on your side, or man's countenance is no longer to be
relied on."</p>

<p id="id09270">"But, Morrel, Albert is your friend?"</p>

<p id="id09271">"Simply an acquaintance, sir."</p>

<p id="id09272">"You met on the same day you first saw me?"</p>

<p id="id09273">"Yes, that is true; but I should not have recollected it if you had not
reminded me."</p>

<p id="id09274">"Thank you, Morrel." Then ringing the bell once, "Look." said he to Ali,
who came immediately, "take that to my solicitor. It is my will, Morrel.
When I am dead, you will go and examine it."</p>

<p id="id09275">"What?" said Morrel, "you dead?"</p>

<p id="id09276">"Yes; must I not be prepared for everything, dear friend? But what did
you do yesterday after you left me?"</p>

<p id="id09277">"I went to Tortoni's, where, as I expected, I found Beauchamp and<br>

Chateau-Renaud. I own I was seeking them."<br></p>

<p id="id09278">"Why, when all was arranged?"</p>

<p id="id09279">"Listen, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable."</p>

<p id="id09280">"Did you doubt it!"</p>

<p id="id09281">"No; the offence was public, and every one is already talking of it."</p>

<p id="id09282">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id09283">"Well, I hoped to get an exchange of arms,&#8212;to substitute the sword for
the pistol; the pistol is blind."</p>

<p id="id09284">"Have you succeeded?" asked Monte Cristo quickly, with an imperceptible
gleam of hope.</p>

<p id="id09285">"No; for your skill with the sword is so well known."</p>

<p id="id09286">"Ah?&#8212;who has betrayed me?"</p>

<p id="id09287">"The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered."</p>

<p id="id09288">"And you failed?"</p>

<p id="id09289">"They positively refused."</p>

<p id="id09290">"Morrel," said the count, "have you ever seen me fire a pistol?"</p>

<p id="id09291">"Never."</p>

<p id="id09292">"Well, we have time; look." Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his
hand when Mercedes entered, and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron
plate, with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the
club. At each shot Morrel turned pale. He examined the bullets with
which Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat, and saw that they were
no larger than buckshot. "It is astonishing," said he. "Look, Emmanuel."
Then turning towards Monte Cristo, "Count," said he, "in the name of
all that is dear to you, I entreat you not to kill Albert!&#8212;the unhappy
youth has a mother."</p>

<p id="id09293">"You are right," said Monte Cristo; "and I have none." These words
were uttered in a tone which made Morrel shudder. "You are the offended
party, count."</p>

<p id="id09294">"Doubtless; what does that imply?"</p>

<p id="id09295">"That you will fire first."</p>

<p id="id09296">"I fire first?"</p>

<p id="id09297">"Oh, I obtained, or rather claimed that; we had conceded enough for them
to yield us that."</p>

<p id="id09298">"And at what distance?"</p>

<p id="id09299">"Twenty paces." A smile of terrible import passed over the count's lips.<br>

"Morrel," said he, "do not forget what you have just seen."<br></p>

<p id="id09300">"The only chance for Albert's safety, then, will arise from your
emotion."</p>

<p id="id09301">"I suffer from emotion?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09302">"Or from your generosity, my friend; to so good a marksman as you are, I
may say what would appear absurd to another."</p>

<p id="id09303">"What is that?"</p>

<p id="id09304">"Break his arm&#8212;wound him&#8212;but do not kill him."</p>

<p id="id09305">"I will tell you, Morrel," said the count, "that I do not need
entreating to spare the life of M. de Morcerf; he shall be so well
spared, that he will return quietly with his two friends, while I"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09306">"And you?"</p>

<p id="id09307">"That will be another thing; I shall be brought home."</p>

<p id="id09308">"No, no," cried Maximilian, quite unable to restrain his feelings.</p>

<p id="id09309">"As I told you, my dear Morrel, M. de Morcerf will kill me." Morrel
looked at him in utter amazement. "But what has happened, then, since
last evening, count?"</p>

<p id="id09310">"The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of<br>

Philippi; I have seen a ghost."<br></p>

<p id="id09311">"And that ghost"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09312">"Told me, Morrel, that I had lived long enough." Maximilian and Emmanuel
looked at each other. Monte Cristo drew out his watch. "Let us go," said
he; "it is five minutes past seven, and the appointment was for eight
o'clock." A carriage was in readiness at the door. Monte Cristo stepped
into it with his two friends. He had stopped a moment in the passage
to listen at a door, and Maximilian and Emmanuel, who had considerately
passed forward a few steps, thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a
sob from within. As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of
meeting. "We are first," said Morrel, looking out of the window. "Excuse
me, sir," said Baptistin, who had followed his master with indescribable
terror, "but I think I see a carriage down there under the trees."</p>

<p id="id09313">Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage, and offered his hand to
assist Emmanuel and Maximilian. The latter retained the count's hand
between his. "I like," said he, "to feel a hand like this, when its
owner relies on the goodness of his cause."</p>

<p id="id09314">"It seems to me," said Emmanuel, "that I see two young men down there,
who are evidently, waiting." Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two
behind his brother-in-law. "Maximilian," said he, "are your affections
disengaged?" Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment. "I do not
seek your confidence, my dear friend. I only ask you a simple question;
answer it;&#8212;that is all I require."</p>

<p id="id09315">"I love a young girl, count."</p>

<p id="id09316">"Do you love her much?"</p>

<p id="id09317">"More than my life."</p>

<p id="id09318">"Another hope defeated!" said the count. Then, with a sigh, "Poor<br>

Haidee!" murmured he.<br></p>

<p id="id09319">"To tell the truth, count, if I knew less of you, I should think that
you were less brave than you are."</p>

<p id="id09320">"Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving? Come, Morrel, it
is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage. Do I regret life?
What is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and death?
Moreover, do not alarm yourself, Morrel; this weakness, if it is such,
is betrayed to you alone. I know the world is a drawing-room, from which
we must retire politely and honestly; that is, with a bow, and our debts
of honor paid."</p>

<p id="id09321">"That is to the purpose. Have you brought your arms?"</p>

<p id="id09322">"I?&#8212;what for? I hope these gentlemen have theirs."</p>

<p id="id09323">"I will inquire," said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id09324">"Do; but make no treaty&#8212;you understand me?"</p>

<p id="id09325">"You need not fear." Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and
Chateau-Renaud, who, seeing his intention, came to meet him. The three
young men bowed to each other courteously, if not affably.</p>

<p id="id09326">"Excuse me, gentlemen," said Morrel, "but I do not see M. de Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id09327">"He sent us word this morning," replied Chateau-Renaud, "that he would
meet us on the ground."</p>

<p id="id09328">"Ah," said Morrel. Beauchamp pulled out his watch. "It is only five
minutes past eight," said he to Morrel; "there is not much time lost
yet."</p>

<p id="id09329">"Oh, I made no allusion of that kind," replied Morrel.</p>

<p id="id09330">"There is a carriage coming," said Chateau-Renaud. It advanced rapidly
along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were
assembled. "You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen? M. de
Monte Cristo yields his right of using his."</p>

<p id="id09331">"We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count," said
Beauchamp, "and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten
days since, thinking to want them on a similar occasion. They are quite
new, and have not yet been used. Will you examine them."</p>

<p id="id09332">"Oh, M. Beauchamp, if you assure me that M. de Morcerf does not know
these pistols, you may readily believe that your word will be quite
sufficient."</p>

<p id="id09333">"Gentlemen," said Chateau-Renaud, "it is not Morcerf coming in that
carriage;&#8212;faith, it is Franz and Debray!" The two young men he
announced were indeed approaching. "What chance brings you here,
gentlemen?" said Chateau-Renaud, shaking hands with each of them.
"Because," said Debray, "Albert sent this morning to request us to
come." Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud exchanged looks of astonishment. "I
think I understand his reason," said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id09334">"What is it?"</p>

<p id="id09335">"Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from M. de Morcerf, begging me
to attend the opera."</p>

<p id="id09336">"And I," said Debray.</p>

<p id="id09337">"And I also," said Franz.</p>

<p id="id09338">"And we, too," added Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id09339">"Having wished you all to witness the challenge, he now wishes you to be
present at the combat."</p>

<p id="id09340">"Exactly so," said the young men; "you have probably guessed right."</p>

<p id="id09341">"But, after all these arrangements, he does not come himself," said<br>

Chateau-Renaud. "Albert is ten minutes after time."<br></p>

<p id="id09342">"There he comes," said Beauchamp, "on horseback, at full gallop,
followed by a servant."</p>

<p id="id09343">"How imprudent," said Chateau-Renaud, "to come on horseback to fight a
duel with pistols, after all the instructions I had given him."</p>

<p id="id09344">"And besides," said Beauchamp, "with a collar above his cravat, an
open coat and white waistcoat! Why has he not painted a spot upon his
heart?&#8212;it would have been more simple." Meanwhile Albert had arrived
within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men. He jumped
from his horse, threw the bridle on his servant's arms, and joined them.
He was pale, and his eyes were red and swollen; it was evident that he
had not slept. A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance,
which was not natural to him. "I thank you, gentlemen," said he, "for
having complied with my request; I feel extremely grateful for this
mark of friendship." Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached, and
remained at a short distance. "And to you also, M. Morrel, my thanks are
due. Come, there cannot be too many."</p>

<p id="id09345">"Sir," said Maximilian, "you are not perhaps aware that I am M. de Monte<br>

Cristo's friend?"<br></p>

<p id="id09346">"I was not sure, but I thought it might be so. So much the better; the
more honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied."</p>

<p id="id09347">"M. Morrel," said Chateau-Renaud, "will you apprise the Count of Monte<br>

Cristo that M. de Morcerf is arrived, and we are at his disposal?"<br>

Morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission. Beauchamp had meanwhile<br>

drawn the box of pistols from the carriage. "Stop, gentlemen," said<br>

Albert; "I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo."<br></p>

<p id="id09348">"In private?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id09349">"No, sir; before all who are here."</p>

<p id="id09350">Albert's witnesses looked at each other. Franz and Debray exchanged some
words in a whisper, and Morrel, rejoiced at this unexpected incident,
went to fetch the count, who was walking in a retired path with
Emmanuel. "What does he want with me?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09351">"I do not know, but he wishes to speak to you."</p>

<p id="id09352">"Ah?" said Monte Cristo, "I trust he is not going to tempt me by some
fresh insult!"</p>

<p id="id09353">"I do not think that such is his intention," said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id09354">The count advanced, accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel. His calm and
serene look formed a singular contrast to Albert's grief-stricken face,
who approached also, followed by the other four young men. When at three
paces distant from each other, Albert and the count stopped.</p>

<p id="id09355">"Approach, gentlemen," said Albert; "I wish you not to lose one word
of what I am about to have the honor of saying to the Count of Monte
Cristo, for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it,
strange as it may appear to you."</p>

<p id="id09356">"Proceed, sir," said the count.</p>

<p id="id09357">"Sir," said Albert, at first with a tremulous voice, but which gradually
became firmer, "I reproached you with exposing the conduct of M. de
Morcerf in Epirus, for guilty as I knew he was, I thought you had no
right to punish him; but I have since learned that you had that right.
It is not Fernand Mondego's treachery towards Ali Pasha which induces
me so readily to excuse you, but the treachery of the fisherman
Fernand towards you, and the almost unheard-of miseries which were
its consequences; and I say, and proclaim it publicly, that you were
justified in revenging yourself on my father, and I, his son, thank you
for not using greater severity."</p>

<p id="id09358">Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this
unexpected scene, it would not have surprised them more than did
Albert's declaration. As for Monte Cristo, his eyes slowly rose towards
heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. He could not understand
how Albert's fiery nature, of which he had seen so much among the Roman
bandits, had suddenly stooped to this humiliation. He recognized the
influence of Mercedes, and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the
sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless. "Now, sir," said Albert,
"if you think my apology sufficient, pray give me your hand. Next to
the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess, I rank that of
candidly acknowledging a fault. But this confession concerns me only. I
acted well as a man, but you have acted better than man. An angel alone
could have saved one of us from death&#8212;that angel came from heaven, if
not to make us friends (which, alas, fatality renders impossible), at
least to make us esteem each other."</p>

<p id="id09359">Monte Cristo, with moistened eye, heaving breast, and lips half open,
extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment
resembling respectful fear. "Gentlemen," said he, "M. de Monte Cristo
receives my apology. I had acted hastily towards him. Hasty actions are
generally bad ones. Now my fault is repaired. I hope the world will not
call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated. But if any one
should entertain a false opinion of me," added he, drawing himself up
as if he would challenge both friends and enemies, "I shall endeavor to
correct his mistake."</p>

<p id="id09360">"What happened during the night?" asked Beauchamp of Chateau-Renaud; "we
appear to make a very sorry figure here."</p>

<p id="id09361">"In truth, what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very
noble," replied the baron.</p>

<p id="id09362">"What can it mean?" said Debray to Franz. "The Count of Monte Cristo
acts dishonorably to M. de Morcerf, and is justified by his son! Had I
ten Yaninas in my family, I should only consider myself the more bound
to fight ten times." As for Monte Cristo, his head was bent down, his
arms were powerless. Bowing under the weight of twenty-four
years' reminiscences, he thought not of Albert, of Beauchamp, of
Chateau-Renaud, or of any of that group; but he thought of that
courageous woman who had come to plead for her son's life, to whom
he had offered his, and who had now saved it by the revelation of a
dreadful family secret, capable of destroying forever in that young
man's heart every feeling of filial piety.</p>

<p id="id09363">"Providence still," murmured he; "now only am I fully convinced of being
the emissary of God!"</p>

<h3 id="id09364" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 91. Mother and Son.</h3>

<p id="id09365">The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy
and dignified smile, and got into his carriage with Maximilian and
Emmanuel. Albert, Beauchamp, and Chateau-Renaud remained alone. Albert
looked at his two friends, not timidly, but in a way that appeared to
ask their opinion of what he had just done.</p>

<p id="id09366">"Indeed, my dear friend," said Beauchamp first, who had either the most
feeling or the least dissimulation, "allow me to congratulate you; this
is a very unhoped-for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair."</p>

<p id="id09367">Albert remained silent and wrapped in thought. Chateau-Renaud contented
himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane. "Are we not
going?" said he, after this embarrassing silence. "When you please,"
replied Beauchamp; "allow me only to compliment M. de Morcerf, who has
given proof to-day of rare chivalric generosity."</p>

<p id="id09368">"Oh, yes," said Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id09369">"It is magnificent," continued Beauchamp, "to be able to exercise so
much self-control!"</p>

<p id="id09370">"Assuredly; as for me, I should have been incapable of it," said<br>

Chateau-Renaud, with most significant coolness.<br></p>

<p id="id09371">"Gentlemen," interrupted Albert, "I think you did not understand
that something very serious had passed between M. de Monte Cristo and
myself."</p>

<p id="id09372">"Possibly, possibly," said Beauchamp immediately; "but every simpleton
would not be able to understand your heroism, and sooner or later you
will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically
than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your
life. May I give you a friendly counsel? Set out for Naples, the Hague,
or St. Petersburg&#8212;calm countries, where the point of honor is better
understood than among our hot-headed Parisians. Seek quietude and
oblivion, so that you may return peaceably to France after a few years.
Am I not right, M. de Chateau-Renaud?"</p>

<p id="id09373">"That is quite my opinion," said the gentleman; "nothing induces serious
duels so much as a duel forsworn."</p>

<p id="id09374">"Thank you, gentlemen," replied Albert, with a smile of indifference;
"I shall follow your advice&#8212;not because you give it, but because I had
before intended to quit France. I thank you equally for the service you
have rendered me in being my seconds. It is deeply engraved on my
heart, and, after what you have just said, I remember that only."
Chateau-Renaud and Beauchamp looked at each other; the impression
was the same on both of them, and the tone in which Morcerf had just
expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have
become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued.</p>

<p id="id09375">"Good-by, Albert," said Beauchamp suddenly, carelessly extending his
hand to the young man. The latter did not appear to arouse from his
lethargy; in fact, he did not notice the offered hand. "Good-by," said
Chateau-Renaud in his turn, keeping his little cane in his left hand,
and saluting with his right. Albert's lips scarcely whispered "Good-by,"
but his look was more explicit; it expressed a whole poem of restrained
anger, proud disdain, and generous indignation. He preserved his
melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends
had regained their carriage; then suddenly unfastening his horse
from the little tree to which his servant had tied it, he mounted and
galloped off in the direction of Paris.</p>

<p id="id09376">In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du Helder.
As he alighted, he thought he saw his father's pale face behind the
curtain of the count's bedroom. Albert turned away his head with a sigh,
and went to his own apartments. He cast one lingering look on all the
luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his
infancy; he looked at the pictures, whose faces seemed to smile, and the
landscapes, which appeared painted in brighter colors. Then he took away
his mother's portrait, with its oaken frame, leaving the gilt frame from
which he took it black and empty. Then he arranged all his beautiful
Turkish arms, his fine English guns, his Japanese china, his cups
mounted in silver, his artistic bronzes by Feucheres and Barye; examined
the cupboards, and placed the key in each; threw into a drawer of his
secretary, which he left open, all the pocket-money he had about
him, and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his
jewel-boxes; then he made an exact inventory of everything, and placed
it in the most conspicuous part of the table, after putting aside the
books and papers which had collected there.</p>

<p id="id09377">At the beginning of this work, his servant, notwithstanding orders to
the contrary, came to his room. "What do you want?" asked he, with a
more sorrowful than angry tone. "Pardon me, sir," replied the valet;
"you had forbidden me to disturb you, but the Count of Morcerf has
called me."</p>

<p id="id09378">"Well!" said Albert.</p>

<p id="id09379">"I did not like to go to him without first seeing you."</p>

<p id="id09380">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id09381">"Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the
meeting this morning."</p>

<p id="id09382">"It is probable," said Albert.</p>

<p id="id09383">"And since he has sent for me, it is doubtless to question me on what
happened there. What must I answer?"</p>

<p id="id09384">"The truth."</p>

<p id="id09385">"Then I shall say the duel did not take place?"</p>

<p id="id09386">"You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Cristo. Go."</p>

<p id="id09387">The valet bowed and retired, and Albert returned to his inventory. As he
was finishing this work, the sound of horses prancing in the yard, and
the wheels of a carriage shaking his window, attracted his attention. He
approached the window, and saw his father get into it, and drive away.
The door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps to his mother's
room; and, no one being there to announce him, he advanced to her
bed-chamber, and distressed by what he saw and guessed, stopped for one
moment at the door. As if the same idea had animated these two beings,
Mercedes was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in
his. Everything was in order,&#8212;laces, dresses, jewels, linen, money, all
were arranged in the drawers, and the countess was carefully collecting
the keys. Albert saw all these preparations and understood them, and
exclaiming, "My mother!" he threw his arms around her neck.</p>

<p id="id09388">The artist who could have depicted the expression of these two
countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture. All
these proofs of an energetic resolution, which Albert did not fear on
his own account, alarmed him for his mother. "What are you doing?" asked
he.</p>

<p id="id09389">"What were you doing?" replied she.</p>

<p id="id09390">"Oh, my mother!" exclaimed Albert, so overcome he could scarcely speak;
"it is not the same with you and me&#8212;you cannot have made the same
resolution I have, for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your
house, and&#8212;and to you."</p>

<p id="id09391">"I also," replied Mercedes, "am going, and I acknowledge I had depended
on your accompanying me; have I deceived myself?"</p>

<p id="id09392">"Mother," said Albert with firmness. "I cannot make you share the fate
I have planned for myself. I must live henceforth without rank and
fortune, and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a
friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned one. So, my dear mother,
I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require
to supply my present wants."</p>

<p id="id09393">"You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger? Oh, do not say so; it
will break my resolutions."</p>

<p id="id09394">"But not mine, mother," replied Albert. "I am young and strong; I
believe I am courageous, and since yesterday I have learned the power
of will. Alas, my dear mother, some have suffered so much, and yet
live, and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of
happiness which heaven had made them&#8212;on the fragments of all the hope
which God had given them! I have seen that, mother; I know that from the
gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so
much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former
conquerors, and have punished them. No, mother; from this moment I have
done with the past, and accept nothing from it&#8212;not even a name, because
you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought
to blush for it before another."</p>

<p id="id09395">"Albert, my child," said Mercedes, "if I had a stronger heart, that is
the counsel I would have given you; your conscience has spoken when my
voice became too weak; listen to its dictates. You had friends, Albert;
break off their acquaintance. But do not despair; you have life before
you, my dear Albert, for you are yet scarcely twenty-two years old; and
as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name, take my father's&#8212;it
was Herrera. I am sure, my dear Albert, whatever may be your career,
you will soon render that name illustrious. Then, my son, return to the
world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows; and if I am
wrong, still let me cherish these hopes, for I have no future to look
forward to. For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this
house."</p>

<p id="id09396">"I will fulfil all your wishes, my dear mother," said the young man.
"Yes, I share your hopes; the anger of heaven will not pursue us, since
you are pure and I am innocent. But, since our resolution is formed,
let us act promptly. M. de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago; the
opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation."</p>

<p id="id09397">"I am ready, my son," said Mercedes. Albert ran to fetch a carriage. He
recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue de
Saints Peres, where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging,
and thither he intended conducting the countess. As the carriage stopped
at the door, and Albert was alighting, a man approached and gave him a
letter. Albert recognized the bearer. "From the count," said Bertuccio.
Albert took the letter, opened, and read it, then looked round for
Bertuccio, but he was gone. He returned to Mercedes with tears in his
eyes and heaving breast, and without uttering a word he gave her the
letter. Mercedes read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09398">Albert,&#8212;While showing you that I have discovered your plans, I hope
also to convince you of my delicacy. You are free, you leave the count's
house, and you take your mother to your home; but reflect, Albert, you
owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her. Keep the struggle
for yourself, bear all the suffering, but spare her the trial of poverty
which must accompany your first efforts; for she deserves not even
the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her, and
providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the
guilty. I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking
anything with you. Do not seek to know how I discovered it; I know
it&#8212;that is sufficient.</p>

<p id="id09399">Now, listen, Albert. Twenty-four years ago I returned, proud and joyful,
to my country. I had a betrothed, Albert, a lovely girl whom I adored,
and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis, painfully
amassed by ceaseless toil. This money was for her; I destined it for
her, and, knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in
the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles, on the
Allees de Meillan. Your mother, Albert, knows that poor house well. A
short time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old
place, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening
I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed
my treasure. The iron box was there&#8212;no one had touched it&#8212;under a
beautiful fig-tree my father had planted the day I was born, which
overshadowed the spot. Well, Albert, this money, which was formerly
designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored,
may now, through strange and painful circumstances, be devoted to the
same purpose. Oh, feel for me, who could offer millions to that poor
woman, but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten
under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved. You are
a generous man, Albert, but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or
resentment; if you refuse me, if you ask another for what I have a right
to offer you, I will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life
of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your
father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair.</p>

<p id="id09400">Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide
after she had finished reading this letter. Mercedes turned her eyes
with an ineffable look towards heaven. "I accept it," said she; "he has
a right to pay the dowry, which I shall take with me to some convent!"
Putting the letter in her bosom, she took her son's arm, and with a
firmer step than she even herself expected she went down-stairs.</p>
