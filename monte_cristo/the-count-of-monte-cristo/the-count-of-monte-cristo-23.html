<p id="id06207">The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort. "M. de<br>

Villefort," he said, "will you conduct the Baroness Danglars?"<br></p>

<p id="id06208">Villefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room.</p>

<h3 id="id06209" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 63. The Dinner.</h3>

<p id="id06210">It was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering
the dining-room. Each one asked what strange influence had brought them
to this house, and yet astonished, even uneasy though they were, they
still felt that they would not like to be absent. The recent events, the
solitary and eccentric position of the count, his enormous, nay, almost
incredible fortune, should have made men cautious, and have altogether
prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own
sex to receive them; and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them
to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum. And all present, even
including Cavalcanti and his son, notwithstanding the stiffness of
the one and the carelessness of the other, were thoughtful, on finding
themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man. Madame
Danglars had started when Villefort, on the count's invitation, offered
his arm; and Villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold
spectacles, when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own.
None of this had escaped the count, and even by this mere contact of
individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an
observer. M. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars, on
his left Morrel. The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and
Danglars; the other seats were filled by Debray, who was placed between
the two Cavalcanti, and by Chateau-Renaud, seated between Madame de
Villefort and Morrel.</p>

<p id="id06211">The repast was magnificent; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to
overturn the Parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the
appetite of his guests. It was an Oriental feast that he offered to
them, but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to
prepare. Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could
provide was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan. Rare birds,
retaining their most brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread upon
massive silver dishes, together with every wine produced in the
Archipelago, Asia Minor, or the Cape, sparkling in bottles, whose
grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught,&#8212;all
these, like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his
guests, passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians,
who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a
dinner for ten persons, but only on the condition of eating pearls, like
Cleopatra, or drinking refined gold, like Lorenzo de' Medici.</p>

<p id="id06212">Monte Cristo noticed the general astonishment, and began laughing
and joking about it. "Gentlemen," he said, "you will admit that, when
arrived at a certain degree of fortune, the superfluities of life are
all that can be desired; and the ladies will allow that, after having
risen to a certain eminence of position, the ideal alone can be
more exalted. Now, to follow out this reasoning, what is the
marvellous?&#8212;that which we do not understand. What is it that we really
desire?&#8212;that which we cannot obtain. Now, to see things which I cannot
understand, to procure impossibilities, these are the study of my life.
I gratify my wishes by two means&#8212;my will and my money. I take as
much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do, M. Danglars, in
promoting a new railway line; you, M. de Villefort, in condemning a
culprit to death; you, M. Debray, in pacifying a kingdom; you, M. de
Chateau-Renaud, in pleasing a woman; and you, Morrel, in breaking a
horse that no one can ride. For example, you see these two fish; one
brought from fifty leagues beyond St. Petersburg, the other five leagues
from Naples. Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table?"</p>

<p id="id06213">"What are the two fish?" asked Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06214">"M. Chateau-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, will tell you the name of
one, and Major Cavalcanti, who is an Italian, will tell you the name of
the other."</p>

<p id="id06215">"This one is, I think, a sterlet," said Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id06216">"And that one, if I mistake not, a lamprey."</p>

<p id="id06217">"Just so. Now, M. Danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are caught."</p>

<p id="id06218">"Sterlets," said Chateau-Renaud, "are only found in the Volga."</p>

<p id="id06219">"And," said Cavalcanti, "I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies lampreys
of that size."</p>

<p id="id06220">"Exactly; one comes from the Volga, and the other from Lake Fusaro."</p>

<p id="id06221">"Impossible!" cried all the guests simultaneously.</p>

<p id="id06222">"Well, this is just what amuses me," said Monte Cristo. "I am like
Nero&#8212;cupitor impossibilium; and that is what is amusing you at this
moment. This fish, which seems so exquisite to you, is very likely no
better than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to procure it, and
here it is."</p>

<p id="id06223">"But how could you have these fish brought to France?"</p>

<p id="id06224">"Oh, nothing more easy. Each fish was brought over in a cask&#8212;one filled
with river herbs and weeds, the other with rushes and lake plants; they
were placed in a wagon built on purpose, and thus the sterlet lived
twelve days, the lamprey eight, and both were alive when my cook seized
them, killing one with milk and the other with wine. You do not believe
me, M. Danglars!"</p>

<p id="id06225">"I cannot help doubting," answered Danglars with his stupid smile.</p>

<p id="id06226">"Baptistin," said the count, "have the other fish brought in&#8212;the
sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks, and which are yet
alive." Danglars opened his bewildered eyes; the company clapped their
hands. Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants,
and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table.</p>

<p id="id06227">"But why have two of each sort?" asked Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06228">"Merely because one might have died," carelessly answered Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06229">"You are certainly an extraordinary man," said Danglars; "and
philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich."</p>

<p id="id06230">"And to have ideas," added Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06231">"Oh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the Romans,
who much esteemed them, and Pliny relates that they sent slaves from
Ostia to Rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus,
and which, from the description, must probably be the goldfish. It was
also considered a luxury to have them alive, it being an amusing sight
to see them die, for, when dying, they change color three or four times,
and like the rainbow when it disappears, pass through all the prismatic
shades, after which they were sent to the kitchen. Their agony formed
part of their merit&#8212;if they were not seen alive, they were despised
when dead."</p>

<p id="id06232">"Yes," said Debray, "but then Ostia is only a few leagues from Rome."</p>

<p id="id06233">"True," said Monte Cristo; "but what would be the use of living eighteen
hundred years after Lucullus, if we can do no better than he could?" The
two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had the good sense not
to say anything. "All this is very extraordinary," said Chateau-Renaud;
"still, what I admire the most, I confess, is the marvellous promptitude
with which your orders are executed. Is it not true that you only bought
this house five or six days ago?"</p>

<p id="id06234">"Certainly not longer."</p>

<p id="id06235">"Well, I am sure it is quite transformed since last week. If I remember
rightly, it had another entrance, and the court-yard was paved and
empty; while to-day we have a splendid lawn, bordered by trees which
appear to be a hundred years old."</p>

<p id="id06236">"Why not? I am fond of grass and shade," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06237">"Yes," said Madame de Villefort, "the door was towards the road before,
and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house
from the road, I remember."</p>

<p id="id06238">"Yes, madame," said Monte Cristo; "but I preferred having an entrance
which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my gate."</p>

<p id="id06239">"In four days," said Morrel; "it is extraordinary!"</p>

<p id="id06240">"Indeed," said Chateau-Renaud, "it seems quite miraculous to make a new
house out of an old one; for it was very old, and dull too. I recollect
coming for my mother to look at it when M. de Saint-Meran advertised it
for sale two or three years ago."</p>

<p id="id06241">"M. de Saint-Meran?" said Madame de Villefort; "then this house belonged
to M. de Saint-Meran before you bought it?"</p>

<p id="id06242">"It appears so," replied Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06243">"Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?"</p>

<p id="id06244">"Quite so; my steward transacts all this business for me."</p>

<p id="id06245">"It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied," said
Chateau-Renaud, "and it was quite melancholy to look at it, with the
blinds closed, the doors locked, and the weeds in the court. Really, if
the house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the procureur, one
might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had
been committed." Villefort, who had hitherto not tasted the three or
four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him, here took one,
and drank it off. Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse, and then
said, "It is singular, baron, but the same idea came across me the first
time I came here; it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it
if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands. Perhaps the
fellow had been bribed by the notary."</p>

<p id="id06246">"It is probable," stammered out Villefort, trying to smile; "but I can
assure you that I had nothing to do with any such proceeding. This house
is part of Valentine's marriage-portion, and M. de Saint-Meran wished to
sell it; for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would
have fallen to ruin." It was Morrel's turn to become pale.</p>

<p id="id06247">"There was, above all, one room," continued Monte Cristo, "very plain in
appearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not why, appeared to me
quite dramatic."</p>

<p id="id06248">"Why so?" said Danglars; "why dramatic?"</p>

<p id="id06249">"Can we account for instinct?" said Monte Cristo. "Are there not some
places where we seem to breathe sadness?&#8212;why, we cannot tell. It is a
chain of recollections&#8212;an idea which carries you back to other times,
to other places&#8212;which, very likely, have no connection with the present
time and place. And there is something in this room which reminds me
forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges [*] or Desdemona. Stay,
since we have finished dinner, I will show it to you, and then we will
take coffee in the garden. After dinner, the play." Monte Cristo looked
inquiringly at his guests. Madame de Villefort rose, Monte Cristo did
the same, and the rest followed their example. Villefort and Madame
Danglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to their seats; they
questioned each other with vague and stupid glances. "Did you hear?"
said Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06250" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     * Elisabeth de Rossan, Marquise de Ganges, was one of the
     famous women of the court of Louis XIV. where she was known
     as "La Belle Provencale." She was the widow of the Marquise
     de Castellane when she married de Ganges, and having the
     misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers-in-law,
     was forced by them to take poison; and they finished her off
     with pistol and dagger.&#8212;Ed.</p>

<p id="id06251">"We must go," replied Villefort, offering his arm. The others, attracted
by curiosity, were already scattered in different parts of the house;
for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room, and
that, at the same time, they would obtain a view of the rest of the
building, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace. Each one went out
by the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained; then,
when they had passed, he brought up the rear, and on his face was a
smile, which, if they could have understood it, would have alarmed them
much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter. They began
by walking through the apartments, many of which were fitted up in
the Eastern style, with cushions and divans instead of beds, and pipes
instead of furniture. The drawing-rooms were decorated with the rarest
pictures by the old masters, the boudoirs hung with draperies from
China, of fanciful colors, fantastic design, and wonderful texture. At
length they arrived at the famous room. There was nothing particular
about it, excepting that, although daylight had disappeared, it was not
lighted, and everything in it was old-fashioned, while the rest of the
rooms had been redecorated. These two causes were enough to give it
a gloomy aspect. "Oh." cried Madame de Villefort, "it is really
frightful." Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not
heard. Many observations were made, the import of which was a unanimous
opinion that there was something sinister about the room. "Is it not
so?" asked Monte Cristo. "Look at that large clumsy bed, hung with such
gloomy, blood-colored drapery! And those two crayon portraits, that have
faded from the dampness; do they not seem to say, with their pale
lips and staring eyes, 'We have seen'?" Villefort became livid; Madame
Danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney. "Oh," said
Madame de Villefort, smiling, "are you courageous enough to sit down
upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed?" Madame
Danglars rose suddenly.</p>

<p id="id06252">"And then," said Monte Cristo, "this is not all."</p>

<p id="id06253">"What is there more?" said Debray, who had not failed to notice the
agitation of Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06254">"Ah, what else is there?" said Danglars; "for, at present, I cannot
say that I have seen anything extraordinary. What do you say, M.
Cavalcanti?"</p>

<p id="id06255">"Ah," said he, "we have at Pisa, Ugolino's tower; at Ferrara, Tasso's
prison; at Rimini, the room of Francesca and Paolo."</p>

<p id="id06256">"Yes, but you have not this little staircase," said Monte Cristo,
opening a door concealed by the drapery. "Look at it, and tell me what
you think of it."</p>

<p id="id06257">"What a wicked-looking, crooked staircase," said Chateau-Renaud with a
smile.</p>

<p id="id06258">"I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but
certainly everything appears to me black in this house," said Debray.</p>

<p id="id06259">Ever since Valentine's dowry had been mentioned, Morrel had been silent
and sad. "Can you imagine," said Monte Cristo, "some Othello or Abbe de
Ganges, one stormy, dark night, descending these stairs step by step,
carrying a load, which he wishes to hide from the sight of man, if not
from God?" Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort, who was
obliged to support himself against the wall. "Ah, madame," cried Debray,
"what is the matter with you? how pale you look!"</p>

<p id="id06260">"It is very evident what is the matter with her," said Madame de
Villefort; "M. de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us,
doubtless intending to frighten us to death."</p>

<p id="id06261">"Yes," said Villefort, "really, count, you frighten the ladies."</p>

<p id="id06262">"What is the matter?" asked Debray, in a whisper, of Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06263">"Nothing," she replied with a violent effort. "I want air, that is all."</p>

<p id="id06264">"Will you come into the garden?" said Debray, advancing towards the back
staircase.</p>

<p id="id06265">"No, no," she answered, "I would rather remain here."</p>

<p id="id06266">"Are you really frightened, madame?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06267">"Oh, no, sir," said Madame Danglars; "but you suppose scenes in a manner
which gives them the appearance of reality."</p>

<p id="id06268">"Ah, yes," said Monte Cristo smiling; "it is all a matter of
imagination. Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest
mother? And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess
Lucina? And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not
to disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father
carrying the sleeping child?" Here Madame Danglars, instead of being
calmed by the soft picture, uttered a groan and fainted. "Madame
Danglars is ill," said Villefort; "it would be better to take her to her
carriage."</p>

<p id="id06269">"Oh, mon Dieu," said Monte Cristo, "and I have forgotten my
smelling-bottle!"</p>

<p id="id06270">"I have mine," said Madame de Villefort; and she passed over to
Monte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good
properties the count had tested on Edward.</p>

<p id="id06271">"Ah," said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand.</p>

<p id="id06272">"Yes," she said, "at your advice I have made the trial."</p>

<p id="id06273">"And have you succeeded?"</p>

<p id="id06274">"I think so."</p>

<p id="id06275">Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo
dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she
returned to consciousness. "Ah," she cried, "what a frightful dream!"</p>

<p id="id06276">Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. They
looked for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in
poetical ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major
Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence. Monte
Cristo seemed in despair. He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and
conducted her into the garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee
between the Cavalcanti. "Really, madame," he said, "did I alarm you
much?"</p>

<p id="id06277">"Oh, no, sir," she answered; "but you know, things impress us
differently, according to the mood of our minds." Villefort forced
a laugh. "And then, you know," he said, "an idea, a supposition, is
sufficient."</p>

<p id="id06278">"Well," said Monte Cristo, "you may believe me if you like, but it is my
opinion that a crime has been committed in this house."</p>

<p id="id06279">"Take care," said Madame de Villefort, "the king's attorney is here."</p>

<p id="id06280">"Ah," replied Monte Cristo, "since that is the case, I will take
advantage of his presence to make my declaration."</p>

<p id="id06281">"Your declaration?" said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id06282">"Yes, before witnesses."</p>

<p id="id06283">"Oh, this is very interesting," said Debray; "if there really has been a
crime, we will investigate it."</p>

<p id="id06284">"There has been a crime," said Monte Cristo. "Come this way, gentlemen;
come, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made
before the competent authorities." He then took Villefort's arm, and, at
the same time, holding that of Madame Danglars under his own, he dragged
the procureur to the plantain-tree, where the shade was thickest. All
the other guests followed. "Stay," said Monte Cristo, "here, in this
very spot" (and he stamped upon the ground), "I had the earth dug up and
fresh mould put in, to refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging,
found a box, or rather, the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which
was the skeleton of a newly born infant." Monte Cristo felt the arm of
Madame Danglars stiffen, while that of Villefort trembled. "A newly born
infant," repeated Debray; "this affair becomes serious!"</p>

<p id="id06285">"Well," said Chateau-Renaud, "I was not wrong just now then, when I
said that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their exteriors
carried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy because
it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime."</p>

<p id="id06286">"Who said it was a crime?" asked Villefort, with a last effort.</p>

<p id="id06287">"How? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?" cried Monte<br>

Cristo. "And pray what do you call such an action?"<br></p>

<p id="id06288">"But who said it was buried alive?"</p>

<p id="id06289">"Why bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a
cemetery."</p>

<p id="id06290">"What is done to infanticides in this country?" asked Major Cavalcanti
innocently.</p>

<p id="id06291">"Oh, their heads are soon cut off," said Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06292">"Ah, indeed?" said Cavalcanti.</p>

<p id="id06293">"I think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06294">"Yes, count," replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely human.</p>

<p id="id06295">Monte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this
scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far,
said, "Come, gentlemen,&#8212;some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it," and
he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.</p>

<p id="id06296">"Indeed, count," said Madame Danglars, "I am ashamed to own it, but all
your frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg you to let me
sit down;" and she fell into a chair. Monte Cristo bowed, and went
to Madame de Villefort. "I think Madame Danglars again requires your
bottle," he said. But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend
the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars, "I must
speak to you."</p>

<p id="id06297">"When?"</p>

<p id="id06298">"To-morrow."</p>

<p id="id06299">"Where?"</p>

<p id="id06300">"In my office, or in the court, if you like,&#8212;that is the surest place."</p>

<p id="id06301">"I will be there."&#8212;At this moment Madame de Villefort approached.
"Thanks, my dear friend," said Madame Danglars, trying to smile; "it is
over now, and I am much better."</p>

<h3 id="id06302" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 64. The Beggar.</h3>

<p id="id06303">The evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return
to Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the
uneasiness she experienced. On his wife's request, M. de Villefort was
the first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his
landau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife.
As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M.
Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While
Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he
had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon
guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been
uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars.
Without opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Chateau-Renaud,
and Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort's
carriage. Danglars, more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had
offered him a seat in his carriage. Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury
waiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the
English fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse.</p>

<p id="id06304">Andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent
lad, and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people,
amongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king's attorney. Then
he had been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the
stiff-necked old major and his modest son, and taking into consideration
the hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the
society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of
his heir. He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond
which shone on the major's little finger; for the major, like a
prudent man, in case of any accident happening to his bank-notes, had
immediately converted them into an available asset. Then, after dinner,
on the pretext of business, he questioned the father and son upon their
mode of living; and the father and son, previously informed that it was
through Danglars the one was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other
50,000 livres annually, were so full of affability that they would
have shaken hands even with the banker's servants, so much did their
gratitude need an object to expend itself upon. One thing above all the
rest heightened the respect, nay almost the veneration, of Danglars
for Cavalcanti. The latter, faithful to the principle of Horace, nil
admirari, had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring
in what lake the best lampreys were caught. Then he had eaten some
without saying a word more; Danglars, therefore, concluded that such
luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of
the Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed upon trout brought from
Switzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by the same means used by
the count to bring the lampreys from Lake Fusaro, and the sterlet from
the Volga. Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard
Cavalcanti pronounce these words, "To-morrow, sir, I shall have the
honor of waiting upon you on business."</p>

<p id="id06305">"And I, sir," said Danglars, "shall be most happy to receive you." Upon
which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hotel des
Princes, if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son. To
this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had
lived independently of him, that he had his own horses and carriages,
and that not having come together, it would not be difficult for them
to leave separately. The major seated himself, therefore, by the side
of Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and
economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to allow his son
60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000
or 600,000 livres.</p>

<p id="id06306">As for Andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom, who,
instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house, had taken it
to the outer door, thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps
to reach it. The groom heard him with humility, took the bit of the
impatient animal with his left hand, and with the right held out the
reins to Andrea, who, taking them from him, rested his polished boot
lightly on the step. At that moment a hand touched his shoulder. The
young man turned round, thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had
forgotten something they wished to tell him, and had returned just as
they were starting. But instead of either of these, he saw nothing but a
strange face, sunburnt, and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as
carbuncles, and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set
of white teeth, pointed and sharp as the wolf's or jackal's. A red
handkerchief encircled his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered
his large bony limbs, which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton,
they would rattle as he walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon
the young man's shoulder, and which was the first thing Andrea saw,
seemed of gigantic size. Did the young man recognize that face by the
light of the lantern in his tilbury, or was he merely struck with the
horrible appearance of his interrogator? We cannot say; but only relate
the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly. "What do you want
of me?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id06307">"Pardon me, my friend, if I disturb you," said the man with the red
handkerchief, "but I want to speak to you."</p>

<p id="id06308">"You have no right to beg at night," said the groom, endeavoring to rid
his master of the troublesome intruder.</p>

<p id="id06309">"I am not begging, my fine fellow," said the unknown to the servant,
with so ironical an expression of the eye, and so frightful a smile,
that he withdrew; "I only wish to say two or three words to your master,
who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago."</p>

<p id="id06310">"Come," said Andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not to
perceive his agitation, "what do you want? Speak quickly, friend."</p>

<p id="id06311">The man said, in a low voice: "I wish&#8212;I wish you to spare me the walk
back to Paris. I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a dinner
as you, I can scarcely stand." The young man shuddered at this strange
familiarity. "Tell me," he said&#8212;"tell me what you want?"</p>

<p id="id06312">"Well, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry
me back." Andrea turned pale, but said nothing.</p>

<p id="id06313">"Yes," said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking
impudently at the youth; "I have taken the whim into my head; do you
understand, Master Benedetto?"</p>

<p id="id06314">At this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went
towards his groom, saying, "This man is right; I did indeed charge him
with a commission, the result of which he must tell me; walk to the
barrier, there take a cab, that you may not be too late." The surprised
groom retired. "Let me at least reach a shady spot," said Andrea.</p>

<p id="id06315">"Oh, as for that, I'll take you to a splendid place," said the man with
the handkerchief; and taking the horse's bit he led the tilbury where
it was certainly impossible for any one to witness the honor that Andrea
conferred upon him.</p>

<p id="id06316">"Don't think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage," said he;
"oh, no, it's only because I am tired, and also because I have a little
business to talk over with you."</p>

<p id="id06317">"Come, step in," said the young man. It was a pity this scene had not
occurred in daylight, for it was curious to see this rascal throwing
himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver
of the tilbury. Andrea drove past the last house in the village without
saying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently, as though
well-pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle.
Once out of Auteuil, Andrea looked around, in order to assure himself
that he could neither be seen nor heard, and then, stopping the horse
and crossing his arms before the man, he asked,&#8212;"Now, tell me why you
come to disturb my tranquillity?"</p>

<p id="id06318">"Let me ask you why you deceived me?"</p>

<p id="id06319">"How have I deceived you?"</p>

<p id="id06320">"'How,' do you ask? When we parted at the Pont du Var, you told me you
were going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany; but instead of that,
you come to Paris."</p>

<p id="id06321">"How does that annoy you?"</p>

<p id="id06322">"It does not; on the contrary, I think it will answer my purpose."</p>

<p id="id06323">"So," said Andrea, "you are speculating upon me?"</p>

<p id="id06324">"What fine words he uses!"</p>

<p id="id06325">"I warn you, Master Caderousse, that you are mistaken."</p>

<p id="id06326">"Well, well, don't be angry, my boy; you know well enough what it is
to be unfortunate; and misfortunes make us jealous. I thought you
were earning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as facchino or
cicerone, and I pitied you sincerely, as I would a child of my own. You
know I always did call you my child."</p>

<p id="id06327">"Come, come, what then?"</p>

<p id="id06328">"Patience&#8212;patience!"</p>

<p id="id06329">"I am patient, but go on."</p>

<p id="id06330">"All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom, a tilbury,
and fine new clothes. You must have discovered a mine, or else become a
stockbroker."</p>

<p id="id06331">"So that, as you confess, you are jealous?"</p>

<p id="id06332">"No, I am pleased&#8212;so pleased that I wished to congratulate you; but as
I am not quite properly dressed, I chose my opportunity, that I might
not compromise you."</p>

<p id="id06333">"Yes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!" exclaimed Andrea; "you
speak to me before my servant."</p>

<p id="id06334">"How can I help that, my boy? I speak to you when I can catch you. You
have a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as an
eel; if I had missed you to-night, I might not have had another chance."</p>

<p id="id06335">"You see, I do not conceal myself."</p>

<p id="id06336">"You are lucky; I wish I could say as much, for I do conceal myself;
and then I was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did," added
Caderousse with his unpleasant smile. "It was very polite of you."</p>

<p id="id06337">"Come," said Andrea, "what do you want?"</p>

<p id="id06338">"You do not speak affectionately to me, Benedetto, my old friend, that
is not right&#8212;take care, or I may become troublesome." This menace
smothered the young man's passion. He urged the horse again into a trot.
"You should not speak so to an old friend like me, Caderousse, as you
said just now; you are a native of Marseilles, I am"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06339">"Do you know then now what you are?"</p>

<p id="id06340">"No, but I was brought up in Corsica; you are old and obstinate, I
am young and wilful. Between people like us threats are out of place,
everything should be amicably arranged. Is it my fault if fortune, which
has frowned on you, has been kind to me?"</p>

<p id="id06341">"Fortune has been kind to you, then? Your tilbury, your groom, your
clothes, are not then hired? Good, so much the better," said Caderousse,
his eyes sparkling with avarice.</p>

<p id="id06342">"Oh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me," said Andrea,
becoming more and more excited. "If I had been wearing a handkerchief
like yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on my feet,
you would not have known me."</p>

<p id="id06343">"You wrong me, my boy; now I have found you, nothing prevents my being
as well-dressed as any one, knowing, as I do, the goodness of your
heart. If you have two coats you will give me one of them. I used to
divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry."</p>

<p id="id06344">"True," said Andrea.</p>

<p id="id06345">"What an appetite you used to have! Is it as good now?"</p>

<p id="id06346">"Oh, yes," replied Andrea, laughing.</p>

<p id="id06347">"How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have
just left?"</p>

<p id="id06348">"He is not a prince; simply a count."</p>

<p id="id06349">"A count, and a rich one too, eh?"</p>

<p id="id06350">"Yes; but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he is not
a very good-tempered gentleman."</p>

<p id="id06351">"Oh, be easy! I have no design upon your count, and you shall have
him all to yourself. But," said Caderousse, again smiling with the
disagreeable expression he had before assumed, "you must pay for it&#8212;you
understand?"</p>

<p id="id06352">"Well, what do you want?"</p>

<p id="id06353">"I think that with a hundred francs a month"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06354">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id06355">"I could live"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06356">"Upon a hundred francs!"</p>

<p id="id06357">"Come&#8212;you understand me; but that with"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06358">"With?"</p>

<p id="id06359">"With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy."</p>

<p id="id06360">"Here are two hundred," said Andrea; and he placed ten gold louis in the
hand of Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id06361">"Good!" said Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id06362">"Apply to the steward on the first day of every month, and you will
receive the same sum."</p>

<p id="id06363">"There now, again you degrade me."</p>

<p id="id06364">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id06365">"By making me apply to the servants, when I want to transact business
with you alone."</p>

<p id="id06366">"Well, be it so, then. Take it from me then, and so long at least as I
receive my income, you shall be paid yours."</p>

<p id="id06367">"Come, come; I always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing
when good fortune happens to such as you. But tell me all about it?"</p>

<p id="id06368">"Why do you wish to know?" asked Cavalcanti.</p>

<p id="id06369">"What? do you again defy me?"</p>

<p id="id06370">"No; the fact is, I have found my father."</p>

<p id="id06371">"What? a real father?"</p>

<p id="id06372">"Yes, so long as he pays me"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06373">"You'll honor and believe him&#8212;that's right. What is his name?"</p>

<p id="id06374">"Major Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id06375">"Is he pleased with you?"</p>

<p id="id06376">"So far I have appeared to answer his purpose."</p>

<p id="id06377">"And who found this father for you?"</p>

<p id="id06378">"The Count of Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id06379">"The man whose house you have just left?"</p>

<p id="id06380">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id06381">"I wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather,
since he holds the money-chest!"</p>

<p id="id06382">"Well, I will mention you to him. Meanwhile, what are you going to do?"</p>

<h5 id="id06383">"I?"</h5>

<p id="id06384">"Yes, you."</p>

<p id="id06385">"It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me."</p>

<p id="id06386">"Since you interest yourself in my affairs, I think it is now my turn to
ask you some questions."</p>

<p id="id06387">"Ah, true. Well; I shall rent a room in some respectable house, wear
a decent coat, shave every day, and go and read the papers in a cafe.
Then, in the evening, I shall go to the theatre; I shall look like some
retired baker. That is what I want."</p>

<p id="id06388">"Come, if you will only put this scheme into execution, and be steady,
nothing could be better."</p>

<p id="id06389">"Do you think so, M. Bossuet? And you&#8212;what will you become? A peer of<br>

France?"<br></p>

<p id="id06390">"Ah," said Andrea, "who knows?"</p>

<p id="id06391">"Major Cavalcanti is already one, perhaps; but then, hereditary rank is
abolished."</p>

<p id="id06392">"No politics, Caderousse. And now that you have all you want, and that
we understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear."</p>

<p id="id06393">"Not at all, my good friend."</p>

<p id="id06394">"How? Not at all?"</p>

<p id="id06395">"Why, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head,
with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my pocket,
without reckoning what was there before&#8212;making in all about two hundred
francs,&#8212;why, I should certainly be arrested at the barriers. Then,
to justify myself, I should say that you gave me the money; this would
cause inquiries, it would be found that I left Toulon without giving
due notice, and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the
Mediterranean. Then I should become simply No. 106, and good-by to
my dream of resembling the retired baker! No, no, my boy; I prefer
remaining honorably in the capital." Andrea scowled. Certainly, as he
had himself owned, the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful
fellow. He drew up for a minute, threw a rapid glance around him, and
then his hand fell instantly into his pocket, where it began playing
with a pistol. But, meanwhile, Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes
off his companion, passed his hand behind his back, and opened a long
Spanish knife, which he always carried with him, to be ready in case
of need. The two friends, as we see, were worthy of and understood one
another. Andrea's hand left his pocket inoffensively, and was carried
up to the red mustache, which it played with for some time. "Good
Caderousse," he said, "how happy you will be."</p>

<p id="id06396">"I will do my best," said the inn-keeper of the Pont du Gard, shutting
up his knife.</p>

<p id="id06397">"Well, then, we will go into Paris. But how will you pass through the
barrier without exciting suspicion? It seems to me that you are in more
danger riding than on foot."</p>

<p id="id06398">"Wait," said Caderousse, "we shall see." He then took the great-coat
with the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury,
and put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcanti's hat, which he
placed upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude
of a servant whose master drives himself.</p>

<p id="id06399">"But, tell me," said Andrea, "am I to remain bareheaded?"</p>

<p id="id06400">"Pooh," said Caderousse; "it is so windy that your hat can easily appear
to have blown off."</p>

<p id="id06401">"Come, come; enough of this," said Cavalcanti.</p>

<p id="id06402">"What are you waiting for?" said Caderousse. "I hope I am not the
cause."</p>

<p id="id06403">"Hush," said Andrea. They passed the barrier without accident. At the
first cross street Andrea stopped his horse, and Caderousse leaped out.</p>

<p id="id06404">"Well!" said Andrea,&#8212;"my servant's coat and my hat?"</p>

<p id="id06405">"Ah," said Caderousse, "you would not like me to risk taking cold?"</p>

<p id="id06406">"But what am I to do?"</p>

<p id="id06407">"You? Oh, you are young while I am beginning to get old. Au revoir,<br>

Benedetto;" and running into a court, he disappeared. "Alas," said<br>

Andrea, sighing, "one cannot be completely happy in this world!"<br></p>

<h3 id="id06408" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 65. A Conjugal Scene.</h3>

<p id="id06409">At the Place Louis XV. the three young people separated&#8212;that is to
say, Morrel went to the Boulevards, Chateau-Renaud to the Pont de
la Revolution, and Debray to the Quai. Most probably Morrel and
Chateau-Renaud returned to their "domestic hearths," as they say in the
gallery of the Chamber in well-turned speeches, and in the theatre of
the Rue Richelieu in well-written pieces; but it was not the case with
Debray. When he reached the wicket of the Louvre, he turned to the left,
galloped across the Carrousel, passed through the Rue Saint-Roch, and,
issuing from the Rue de la Michodiere, he arrived at M. Danglars' door
just at the same time that Villefort's landau, after having deposited
him and his wife at the Faubourg St. Honore, stopped to leave the
baroness at her own house. Debray, with the air of a man familiar with
the house, entered first into the court, threw his bridle into the hands
of a footman, and returned to the door to receive Madame Danglars, to
whom he offered his arm, to conduct her to her apartments. The gate once
closed, and Debray and the baroness alone in the court, he asked,&#8212;"What
was the matter with you, Hermine? and why were you so affected at that
story, or rather fable, which the count related?"</p>

<p id="id06410">"Because I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening, my
friend," said the baroness.</p>

<p id="id06411">"No, Hermine," replied Debray; "you cannot make me believe that; on the
contrary, you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count's.
M. Danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but I know how much you care
for his ill-humor. Some one has vexed you; I will allow no one to annoy
you."</p>

<p id="id06412">"You are deceived, Lucien, I assure you," replied Madame Danglars; "and
what I have told you is really the case, added to the ill-humor you
remarked, but which I did not think it worth while to allude to." It
was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous
irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to
themselves; or that, as Debray had guessed, she had experienced some
secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to any one. Being a
man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent
penalties of womanhood, he did not then press his inquiries, but waited
for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate
her, or receive an avowal proprio motu. At the door of her apartment the
baroness met Mademoiselle Cornelie, her confidential maid. "What is my
daughter doing?" asked Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06413">"She practiced all the evening, and then went to bed," replied<br>

Mademoiselle Cornelie.<br></p>

<p id="id06414">"Yet I think I hear her piano."</p>

<p id="id06415">"It is Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly, who is playing while Mademoiselle<br>

Danglars is in bed."<br></p>

<p id="id06416">"Well," said Madame Danglars, "come and undress me." They entered
the bedroom. Debray stretched himself upon a large couch, and Madame
Danglars passed into her dressing-room with Mademoiselle Cornelie. "My
dear M. Lucien," said Madame Danglars through the door, "you are always
complaining that Eugenie will not address a word to you."</p>

<p id="id06417">"Madame," said Lucien, playing with a little dog, who, recognizing him
as a friend of the house, expected to be caressed, "I am not the only
one who makes similar complaints, I think I heard Morcerf say that he
could not extract a word from his betrothed."</p>

<p id="id06418">"True," said Madame Danglars; "yet I think this will all pass off, and
that you will one day see her enter your study."</p>

<p id="id06419">"My study?"</p>

<p id="id06420">"At least that of the minister."</p>

<p id="id06421">"Why so!"</p>

<p id="id06422">"To ask for an engagement at the Opera. Really, I never saw such an
infatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of
fashion." Debray smiled. "Well," said he, "let her come, with your
consent and that of the baron, and we will try and give her an
engagement, though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers."</p>

<p id="id06423">"Go, Cornelie," said Madame Danglars, "I do not require you any longer."</p>

<p id="id06424">Cornelie obeyed, and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in
a charming loose dress, and came and sat down close to Debray. Then she
began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel. Lucien looked at her
for a moment in silence. "Come, Hermine," he said, after a short time,
"answer candidly,&#8212;something vexes you&#8212;is it not so?"</p>

<p id="id06425">"Nothing," answered the baroness.</p>

<p id="id06426">And yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards
a looking-glass. "I am frightful to-night," she said. Debray rose,
smiling, and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter
point, when the door opened suddenly. M. Danglars appeared; Debray
reseated himself. At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round,
and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble
to conceal. "Good-evening, madame," said the banker; "good-evening, M.
Debray."</p>

<p id="id06427">Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire
to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming
a dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her
husband. "Read me something, M. Debray," she said. Debray, who was
slightly disturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the
calmness of the baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl
knife inlaid with gold. "Excuse me," said the banker, "but you will
tire yourself, baroness, by such late hours, and M. Debray lives some
distance from here."</p>

<p id="id06428">Debray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and
politely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness
there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his
wife might wish to do. The baroness was also surprised, and showed her
astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon
her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where
he was looking to see the closing stock quotations. The result was, that
the proud look entirely failed of its purpose.</p>

<p id="id06429">"M. Lucien," said the baroness, "I assure you I have no desire to sleep,
and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening, which you
must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me."</p>

<p id="id06430">"I am at your service, madame," replied Lucien coldly.</p>

<p id="id06431">"My dear M. Debray," said the banker, "do not kill yourself to-night
listening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as
well to-morrow; but I claim to-night and will devote it, if you will
allow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife." This time
the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien and the
baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with their
eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the irresistible
will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband was
victorious.</p>

<p id="id06432">"Do not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray," continued
Danglars; "oh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask
my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I make
such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me." Debray muttered
something, bowed and went out, knocking himself against the edge of the
door, like Nathan in "Athalie."</p>

<p id="id06433">"It is extraordinary," he said, when the door was closed behind him,
"how easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an advantage over
us."</p>

<p id="id06434">Lucien having left, Danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the open
book, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he began
playing with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as Debray,
and attempting to bite him, Danglars seized him by the skin of his neck
and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room. The animal
uttered a cry during the transit, but, arrived at its destination, it
crouched behind the cushions, and stupefied at such unusual treatment
remained silent and motionless. "Do you know, sir," asked the baroness,
"that you are improving? Generally you are only rude, but to-night you
are brutal."</p>

<p id="id06435">"It is because I am in a worse humor than usual," replied Danglars.
Hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain. These glances
frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars, but this evening he took
no notice of them.</p>

<p id="id06436">"And what have I to do with your ill-humor?" said the baroness,
irritated at the impassibility of her husband; "do these things concern
me? Keep your ill-humor at home in your money boxes, or, since you have
clerks whom you pay, vent it upon them."</p>

<p id="id06437">"Not so," replied Danglars; "your advice is wrong, so I shall not follow
it. My money boxes are my Pactolus, as, I think, M. Demoustier says, and
I will not retard its course, or disturb its calm. My clerks are honest
men, who earn my fortune, whom I pay much below their deserts, if I may
value them according to what they bring in; therefore I shall not get
into a passion with them; those with whom I will be in a passion are
those who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my fortune."</p>

<p id="id06438">"And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune? Explain yourself
more clearly, I beg, sir."</p>

<p id="id06439">"Oh, make yourself easy!&#8212;I am not speaking riddles, and you will soon
know what I mean. The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw
out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour."</p>

<p id="id06440">"I do not understand you, sir," said the baroness, trying to disguise
the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face. "You understand me
perfectly, on the contrary," said Danglars: "but, if you will persist,
I will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs upon the Spanish
loan."</p>

<p id="id06441">"And pray," asked the baroness, "am I responsible for this loss?"</p>

<p id="id06442">"Why not?"</p>

<p id="id06443">"Is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?"</p>

<p id="id06444">"Certainly it is not mine."</p>

<p id="id06445">"Once for all, sir," replied the baroness sharply, "I tell you I will
not hear cash named; it is a style of language I never heard in the
house of my parents or in that of my first husband."</p>

<p id="id06446">"Oh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny."</p>

<p id="id06447">"The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the
bank, which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that noise
of jingling crowns, which are constantly being counted and re-counted,
is odious to me. I only know one thing I dislike more, which is the
sound of your voice."</p>

<p id="id06448">"Really?" said Danglars. "Well, this surprises me, for I thought you
took the liveliest interest in all my affairs!"</p>

<p id="id06449">"I? What could put such an idea into your head?"</p>

<p id="id06450">"Yourself."</p>

<p id="id06451">"Ah?&#8212;what next?"</p>

<p id="id06452">"Most assuredly."</p>

<p id="id06453">"I should like to know upon what occasion?"</p>

<p id="id06454">"Oh, mon Dieu, that is very easily done. Last February you were the
first who told me of the Haitian funds. You had dreamed that a ship had
entered the harbor at Havre, that this ship brought news that a
payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made. I know how
clear-sighted your dreams are; I therefore purchased immediately as many
shares as I could of the Haitian debt, and I gained 400,000 francs by
it, of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you. You spent it as you
pleased; that was your business. In March there was a question about a
grant to a railway. Three companies presented themselves, each offering
equal securities. You told me that your instinct,&#8212;and although you
pretend to know nothing about speculations, I think on the contrary,
that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs,&#8212;well, you
told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given
to the company called the Southern. I bought two thirds of the shares
of that company; as you had foreseen, the shares trebled in value, and
I picked up a million, from which 250,000 francs were paid to you for
pin-money. How have you spent this 250,000 francs?&#8212;it is no business of
mine."</p>

<p id="id06455">"When are you coming to the point?" cried the baroness, shivering with
anger and impatience.</p>

<p id="id06456">"Patience, madame, I am coming to it."</p>

<p id="id06457">"That's fortunate."</p>

<p id="id06458">"In April you went to dine at the minister's. You heard a private
conversation respecting Spanish affairs&#8212;on the expulsion of Don Carlos.
I bought some Spanish shares. The expulsion took place and I pocketed
600,000 francs the day Charles V. repassed the Bidassoa. Of these
600,000 francs you took 50,000 crowns. They were yours, you disposed of
them according to your fancy, and I asked no questions; but it is not
the less true that you have this year received 500,000 livres."</p>

<p id="id06459">"Well, sir, and what then?"</p>

<p id="id06460">"Ah, yes, it was just after this that you spoiled everything."</p>

<p id="id06461">"Really, your manner of speaking"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06462">"It expresses my meaning, and that is all I want. Well, three days after
that you talked politics with M. Debray, and you fancied from his words
that Don Carlos had returned to Spain. Well, I sold my shares, the news
got out, and I no longer sold&#8212;I gave them away, next day I find the
news was false, and by this false report I have lost 700,000. francs."</p>

<p id="id06463">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id06464">"Well, since I gave you a fourth of my gains, I think you owe me a
fourth of my losses; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs."</p>

<p id="id06465">"What you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M. Debray's name is mixed
up in this affair."</p>

<p id="id06466">"Because if you do not possess the 175,000 francs I reclaim, you must
have lent them to your friends, and M. Debray is one of your friends."</p>

<p id="id06467">"For shame!" exclaimed the baroness.</p>

<p id="id06468">"Oh, let us have no gestures, no screams, no modern drama, or you will
oblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here, pocketing the whole
of the 500,000 livres you have handed over to him this year, while
he smiles to himself, saying that he has found what the most skilful
players have never discovered&#8212;that is, a roulette where he wins without
playing, and is no loser when he loses." The baroness became enraged.
"Wretch!" she cried, "will you dare to tell me you did not know what you
now reproach me with?"</p>

<p id="id06469">"I do not say that I did know it, and I do not say that I did not know
it. I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years
that we have ceased to be husband and wife, and see whether it has not
always been consistent. Some time after our rupture, you wished to
study music, under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful
appearance at the Theatre Italien; at the same time I felt inclined to
learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in London.
This cost me, on your account and mine, 100,000 francs. I said nothing,
for we must have peace in the house; and 100,000 francs for a lady and
gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too
much. Well, you soon become tired of singing, and you take a fancy
to study diplomacy with the minister's secretary. You understand, it
signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your
own cashbox. But to-day I find you are drawing on mine, and that your
apprenticeship may cost me 700,000 francs per month. Stop there, madame,
for this cannot last. Either the diplomatist must give his lessons
gratis, and I will tolerate him, or he must never set his foot again in
my house;&#8212;do you understand, madame?"</p>

<p id="id06470">"Oh, this is too much," cried Hermine, choking, "you are worse than
despicable."</p>

<p id="id06471">"But," continued Danglars, "I find you did not even pause there"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06472">"Insults!"</p>

<p id="id06473">"You are right; let us leave these facts alone, and reason coolly. I
have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good; treat me
in the same way. You say you have nothing to do with my cash-box. Be
it so. Do as you like with your own, but do not fill or empty mine.
Besides, how do I know that this was not a political trick, that the
minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition, and jealous of the
popular sympathy I excite, has not concerted with M. Debray to ruin me?"</p>

<p id="id06474">"A probable thing!"</p>

<p id="id06475">"Why not? Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this?&#8212;a false
telegraphic despatch&#8212;it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be
made as they were in the last two telegrams. It was done on purpose for
me&#8212;I am sure of it."</p>

<p id="id06476">"Sir," said the baroness humbly, "are you not aware that the man
employed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law with him,
that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have
been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which proves
that he was either mad or guilty? It was a mistake."</p>

<p id="id06477">"Yes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a
sleepless night, which has caused the minister's secretaries to blacken
several sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs."</p>

<p id="id06478">"But, sir," said Hermine suddenly, "if all this is, as you say, caused
by M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell
me of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?"</p>

<p id="id06479">"Do I know M. Debray?&#8212;do I wish to know him?&#8212;do I wish to know that he
gives advice?&#8212;do I wish to follow it?&#8212;do I speculate? No; you do all
this, not I."</p>

<p id="id06480">"Still it seems to me, that as you profit by it&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id06481">Danglars shrugged his shoulders. "Foolish creature," he exclaimed.
"Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three
intrigues without being the talk of Paris! But know that if you had
even hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the
commencement of the art&#8212;for generally husbands will not see&#8212;you would
then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the
women of the world. But it has not been so with me,&#8212;I see, and always
have seen, during the last sixteen years. You may, perhaps, have hidden
a thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped me,
while you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed you
had deceived me. What has been the result?&#8212;that, thanks to my pretended
ignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort to M.
Debray, who has not trembled before me. There is not one who has not
treated me as the master of the house,&#8212;the only title I desire with
respect to you; there is not one, in fact, who would have dared to speak
of me as I have spoken of them this day. I will allow you to make me
hateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above
all, I forbid you to ruin me."</p>

<p id="id06482">The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had
been pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if touched by
a spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition;
she then took two or three steps towards her husband, as though to tear
the secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which he withheld from
some odious calculation,&#8212;odious, as all his calculations were. "M. de
Villefort!&#8212;What do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id06483">"I mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a
philosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing there was
nothing to be got out of a king's attorney, died of grief or anger at
finding, after an absence of nine months, that you had been enceinte
six. I am brutal,&#8212;I not only allow it, but boast of it; it is one
of the reasons of my success in commercial business. Why did he kill
himself instead of you? Because he had no cash to save. My life belongs
to my cash. M. Debray has made me lose 700,000 francs; let him bear his
share of the loss, and we will go on as before; if not, let him become
bankrupt for the 250,000 livres, and do as all bankrupts do&#8212;disappear.
He is a charming fellow, I allow, when his news is correct; but when
it is not, there are fifty others in the world who would do better than
he."</p>

<p id="id06484">Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort
to reply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of
Villefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes
which had taken place in her house during the last few days, and changed
the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate.
Danglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint.
He shut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and
returned to his apartments; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her
half-fainting condition, she could almost believe that she had had a
disagreeable dream.</p>

<h3 id="id06485" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 66. Matrimonial Projects.</h3>

<p id="id06486">The day following this scene, at the hour the banker usually chose to
pay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his coupe
did not appear. At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame
Danglars ordered her carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a
curtain, watched the departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders
that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at
two o'clock she had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove
to the Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From
twelve to two o'clock Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his
dispatches, and becoming more and more sad every minute, heaping
figure upon figure, and receiving, among other visits, one from Major
Cavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as ever, presented himself precisely
at the hour named the night before, to terminate his business with the
banker. On leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had shown violent marks of
agitation during the sitting, and been more bitter than ever against the
ministry, re-entered his carriage, and told the coachman to drive to the
Avenue des Champs-Elysees, No. 30.</p>

<p id="id06487">Monte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with some one and begged
Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room. While the banker was
waiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abbe
and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and
instead of waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments,
and disappeared. A minute after the door by which the priest had entered
reopened, and Monte Cristo appeared. "Pardon me," said he, "my dear
baron, but one of my friends, the Abbe Busoni, whom you perhaps saw pass
by, has just arrived in Paris; not having seen him for a long time, I
could not make up my mind to leave him sooner, so I hope this will be
sufficient reason for my having made you wait."</p>

<p id="id06488">"Nay," said Danglars, "it is my fault; I have chosen my visit at a wrong
time, and will retire."</p>

<p id="id06489">"Not at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter
with you? You look careworn; really, you alarm me. Melancholy in a
capitalist, like the appearance of a comet, presages some misfortune to
the world."</p>

<p id="id06490">"I have been in ill-luck for several days," said Danglars, "and I have
heard nothing but bad news."</p>

<p id="id06491">"Ah, indeed?" said Monte Cristo. "Have you had another fall at the<br>

Bourse?"<br></p>

<p id="id06492">"No; I am safe for a few days at least. I am only annoyed about a
bankrupt of Trieste."</p>

<p id="id06493">"Really? Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi?"</p>

<p id="id06494">"Exactly so. Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I
don't know how long, to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs during
the year. Never a mistake or delay&#8212;a fellow who paid like a prince.
Well, I was a million in advance with him, and now my fine Jacopo
Manfredi suspends payment!"</p>

<p id="id06495">"Really?"</p>

<p id="id06496">"It is an unheard-of fatality. I draw upon him for 600,000. francs, my
bills are returned unpaid, and, more than that, I hold bills of
exchange signed by him to the value of 400,000. francs, payable at his
correspondent's in Paris at the end of this month. To-day is the 30th.
I present them; but my correspondent has disappeared. This, with my
Spanish affairs, made a pretty end to the month."</p>

<p id="id06497">"Then you really lost by that affair in Spain?"</p>

<p id="id06498">"Yes; only 700,000 francs out of my cash-box&#8212;nothing more!"</p>

<p id="id06499">"Why, how could you make such a mistake&#8212;such an old stager?"</p>

<p id="id06500">"Oh, it is all my wife's fault. She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to
Spain; she believes in dreams. It is magnetism, she says, and when she
dreams a thing it is sure to happen, she assures me. On this conviction
I allow her to speculate, she having her bank and her stockbroker; she
speculated and lost. It is true she speculates with her own money, not
mine; nevertheless, you can understand that when 700,000. francs leave
the wife's pocket, the husband always finds it out. But do you mean to
say you have not heard of this? Why, the thing has made a tremendous
noise."</p>

<p id="id06501">"Yes, I heard it spoken of, but I did not know the details, and then no
one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse."</p>

<p id="id06502">"Then you do not speculate?"</p>

<p id="id06503">"I?&#8212;How could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in
regulating my income? I should be obliged, besides my steward, to keep
a clerk and a boy. But touching these Spanish affairs, I think that the
baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter. The papers
said something about it, did they not?"</p>

<p id="id06504">"Then you believe the papers?"</p>

<p id="id06505">"I?&#8212;not the least in the world; only I fancied that the honest Messager
was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced telegraphic
despatches."</p>

<p id="id06506">"Well, that's what puzzles me," replied Danglars; "the news of the
return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph."</p>

<p id="id06507">"So that," said Monte Cristo, "you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs
this month."</p>

<p id="id06508">"Not nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss."</p>

<p id="id06509">"Diable," said Monte Cristo compassionately, "it is a hard blow for a
third-rate fortune."</p>

<p id="id06510">"Third-rate," said Danglars, rather humble, "what do you mean by that?"</p>

<p id="id06511">"Certainly," continued Monte Cristo, "I make three assortments in
fortune&#8212;first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate fortunes. I call those
first-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one's
hand, such as mines, lands, and funded property, in such states as
France, Austria, and England, provided these treasures and property form
a total of about a hundred millions; I call those second-rate fortunes,
that are gained by manufacturing enterprises, joint-stock companies,
viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more than 1,500,000
francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions; finally,
I call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of a fluctuating
capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances which
a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks,
speculations of the day&#8212;in fact, all operations under the influence of
greater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious
capital of about fifteen millions. I think this is about your position,
is it not?"</p>

<p id="id06512">"Confound it, yes!" replied Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06513">"The result, then, of six more such months as this would be to reduce
the third-rate house to despair."</p>

<p id="id06514">"Oh," said Danglars, becoming very pale, how you are running on!"</p>
