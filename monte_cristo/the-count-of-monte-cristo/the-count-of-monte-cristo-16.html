<p id="id04324">"Yes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and
with my knife forced open the lock of the box. In a fine linen cloth
was wrapped a new-born child. Its purple visage, and its violet-colored
hands showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not
yet cold, I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet.
After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart,
and as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a
doctor would have done&#8212;I inflated the lungs by blowing air into them,
and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and
cried feebly. In my turn I uttered a cry, but a cry of joy. 'God has
not cursed me then,' I cried, 'since he permits me to save the life of a
human creature, in exchange for the life I have taken away.'"</p>

<p id="id04325">"And what did you do with the child?" asked Monte Cristo. "It was an
embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape."</p>

<p id="id04326">"I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at Paris
there was an asylum where they receive such creatures. As I passed the
city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road, and I
inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my statement, the linen
proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents, the blood with which
I was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from any
one else. No objection was raised, but they pointed out the asylum,
which was situated at the upper end of the Rue d'Enfer, and after having
taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces, so that one
of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the
child, while the other remained in my possession, I rang the bell, and
fled with all speed. A fortnight after I was at Rogliano, and I said to
Assunta,&#8212;'Console thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.'
She demanded what I meant, and when I had told her all,&#8212;'Giovanni,'
said she, 'you should have brought this child with you; we would have
replaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then, in
consequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.' In reply I
gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him if we
became rich."</p>

<p id="id04327">"What letters were marked on the linen?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04328">"An H and an N, surmounted by a baron's coronet."</p>

<p id="id04329">"By heaven, M. Bertuccio, you make use of heraldic terms; where did you
study heraldry?"</p>

<p id="id04330">"In your service, excellency, where everything is learned."</p>

<p id="id04331">"Go on, I am curious to know two things."</p>

<p id="id04332">"What are they, your excellency?"</p>

<p id="id04333">"What became of this little boy? for I think you told me it was a boy,<br>

M. Bertuccio."<br></p>

<p id="id04334">"No excellency, I do not recollect telling you that."</p>

<p id="id04335">"I thought you did; I must have been mistaken."</p>

<p id="id04336">"No, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy. But your
excellency wished to know two things; what was the second?"</p>

<p id="id04337">"The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a
confessor, and the Abbe Busoni came to visit you at your request in the
prison at Nimes."</p>

<p id="id04338">"The story will be very long, excellency."</p>

<p id="id04339">"What matter? you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose you
are very much inclined for it either." Bertuccio bowed, and resumed his
story.</p>

<p id="id04340">"Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me, partly
to supply the wants of the poor widow, I eagerly returned to my trade of
smuggler, which had become more easy since that relaxation of the
laws which always follows a revolution. The southern districts were
ill-watched in particular, in consequence of the disturbances that were
perpetually breaking out in Avignon, Nimes, or Uzes. We profited by this
respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere. Since
my brother's assassination in the streets of Nimes, I had never
entered the town; the result was that the inn-keeper with whom we were
connected, seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to
come to us, and had established a branch to his inn, on the road from
Bellegarde to Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard. We had thus,
at Aigues-Mortes, Martigues, or Bouc, a dozen places where we left our
goods, and where, in case of necessity, we concealed ourselves from the
gendarmes and custom-house officers. Smuggling is a profitable trade,
when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for
myself, brought up in the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing
the gendarmes and custom-house officers, as my appearance before the
judges would cause an inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into the
past. And in my past life they might find something far more grave than
the selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a permit.
So, preferring death to capture, I accomplished the most astonishing
deeds, and which, more than once, showed me that the too great care we
take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects
which require rapid decision, and vigorous and determined execution. In
reality, when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises,
you are no longer the equal of other men, or, rather, other men are no
longer your equals, and whosoever has taken this resolution, feels his
strength and resources doubled."</p>

<p id="id04341">"Philosophy, M. Bertuccio," interrupted the Count; "you have done a
little of everything in your life."</p>

<p id="id04342">"Oh, excellency!"</p>

<p id="id04343">"No, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late; yet
I have no other observation to make, for what you say is correct, which
is more than can be said for all philosophy."</p>

<p id="id04344">"My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive. Assunta
took care of all, and our little fortune increased. One day as I was
setting off on an expedition, 'Go,' said she; 'at your return I will
give you a surprise.' I questioned her, but in vain; she would tell me
nothing, and I departed. Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks; we had
been to Lucca to take in oil, to Leghorn for English cottons, and we
ran our cargo without opposition, and returned home full of joy. When I
entered the house, the first thing I beheld in the middle of Assunta's
chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the
rest of the furniture, and in it a baby seven or eight months old. I
uttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness I had known since the
assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I
had abandoned this child. For the assassination itself I had never
felt any remorse. Poor Assunta had guessed all. She had profited by my
absence, and furnished with the half of the linen, and having written
down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum,
had set off for Paris, and had reclaimed it. No objection was raised,
and the infant was given up to her. Ah, I confess, your excellency, when
I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle, I felt my
eyes filled with tears. 'Ah, Assunta,' cried I, 'you are an excellent
woman, and heaven will bless you.'"</p>

<p id="id04345">"This," said Monte Cristo, "is less correct than your philosophy,&#8212;it is
only faith."</p>

<p id="id04346">"Alas, your excellency is right," replied Bertuccio, "and God made this
infant the instrument of our punishment. Never did a perverse nature
declare itself more prematurely, and yet it was not owing to any fault
in his bringing up. He was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes, of
that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion; only
his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular expression,
and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of his smile.
Unfortunately, there is a proverb which says that 'red is either
altogether good or altogether bad.' The proverb was but too correct
as regarded Benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the
worst disposition. It is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother
encouraged him. This child, for whom my poor sister would go to the
town, five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and
the most tempting sweetmeats, preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese
preserves, the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor's orchard, or the dried
apples in his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples
that grew in my garden. One day, when Benedetto was about five or six,
our neighbor Vasilio, who, according to the custom of the country, never
locked up his purse or his valuables&#8212;for, as your excellency knows,
there are no thieves in Corsica&#8212;complained that he had lost a louis
out of his purse; we thought he must have made a mistake in counting
his money, but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement. One day,
Benedetto, who had been gone from the house since morning, to our great
anxiety, did not return until late in the evening, dragging a monkey
after him, which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree. For
more than a month past, the mischievous child, who knew not what to wish
for, had taken it into his head to have a monkey. A boatman, who had
passed by Rogliano, and who had several of these animals, whose tricks
had greatly diverted him, had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him.
'Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees,' said I; 'confess
how you obtained this animal.' Benedetto maintained the truth of what
he had said, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his
imagination than to his veracity. I became angry; he began to laugh, I
threatened to strike him, and he made two steps backwards. 'You cannot
beat me,' said he; 'you have no right, for you are not my father.'</p>

<p id="id04347">"We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret, which we had so
carefully concealed from him; however, it was this answer, in which the
child's whole character revealed itself, that almost terrified me, and
my arm fell without touching him. The boy triumphed, and this victory
rendered him so audacious, that all the money of Assunta, whose
affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it,
was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against, and follies
she had not the courage to prevent. When I was at Rogliano everything
went on properly, but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became
master, and everything went ill. When he was only eleven, he chose his
companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty, the worst
characters in Bastia, or, indeed, in Corsica, and they had already,
for some mischievous pranks, been several times threatened with a
prosecution. I became alarmed, as any prosecution might be attended with
serious consequences. I was compelled, at this period, to leave Corsica
on an important expedition; I reflected for a long time, and with the
hope of averting some impending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto
should accompany me. I hoped that the active and laborious life of a
smuggler, with the severe discipline on board, would have a salutary
effect on his character, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt.
I spoke to Benedetto alone, and proposed to him to accompany me,
endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the
imagination of a child of twelve. He heard me patiently, and when I had
finished, burst out laughing.</p>

<p id="id04348">"'Are you mad, uncle?' (he called me by this name when he was in good
humor); 'do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your mode
of existence&#8212;my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil
you impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night, and the
scorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and when you are
perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum? Why, I
have as much money as I want; mother Assunta always furnishes me when I
ask for it! You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer.' The
arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto rejoined
his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a
fool."</p>

<p id="id04349">"Sweet child," murmured Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04350">"Oh, had he been my own son," replied Bertuccio, "or even my nephew, I
would have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that
you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was
striking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me
to punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the unfortunate
boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several times missed
money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place in which to
conceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was already made
up. Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the fit
seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week. My intention
was to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and without letting him know
anything of my plan, to convey him some morning on board; by this means
his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct. I set off for
France, after having fixed upon the plan. Our cargo was to be landed in
the Gulf of Lyons, and this was a difficult thing to do because it was
then the year 1829. The most perfect tranquillity was restored, and
the vigilance of the custom-house officers was redoubled, and their
strictness was increased at this time, in consequence of the fair at
Beaucaire.</p>

<p id="id04351">"Our expedition made a favorable beginning. We anchored our
vessel&#8212;which had a double hold, where our goods were concealed&#8212;amidst
a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhone from
Beaucaire to Arles. On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in
the night, and to convey it into the town, by the help of the inn-keeper
with whom we were connected. Whether success rendered us imprudent,
or whether we were betrayed, I know not; but one evening, about five
o'clock, our little cabin-boy came breathlessly, to inform us that
he had seen a detachment of custom-house officers advancing in our
direction. It was not their proximity that alarmed us, for detachments
were constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhone, but the care,
according to the boy's account, that they took to avoid being seen. In
an instant we were on the alert, but it was too late; our vessel was
surrounded, and amongst the custom-house officers I observed several
gendarmes, and, as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was
brave at the sight of any other, I sprang into the hold, opened a
port, and dropped into the river, dived, and only rose at intervals to
breathe, until I reached a ditch that had recently been made from the
Rhone to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. I was now
safe, for I could swim along the ditch without being seen, and I reached
the canal in safety. I had designedly taken this direction. I have
already told your excellency of an inn-keeper from Nimes who had set up
a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire."</p>

<p id="id04352">"Yes," said Monte Cristo "I perfectly recollect him; I think he was your
colleague."</p>

<p id="id04353">"Precisely," answered Bertuccio; "but he had, seven or eight years
before this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles,
who, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his
fortune in another. Of course, we made the same arrangements with the
new landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I
intended to ask shelter."</p>

<p id="id04354">"What was his name?" inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat
interested in Bertuccio's story.</p>

<p id="id04355">"Gaspard Caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of
Carconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her
village. She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by
inches. As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or five
and forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample proof
of his presence of mind and courage."</p>

<p id="id04356">"And you say," interrupted Monte Cristo "that this took place towards
the year"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04357">"1829, your excellency."</p>

<p id="id04358">"In what month?"</p>

<p id="id04359">"June."</p>

<p id="id04360">"The beginning or the end?"</p>

<p id="id04361">"The evening of the 3d."</p>

<p id="id04362">"Ah," said Monte Cristo "the evening of the 3d of June, 1829. Go on."</p>

<p id="id04363">"It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as we
never entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not
to break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept
amongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might
have some guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed
the night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in
which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity
of announcing our presence. My intention was, if Caderousse was alone,
to acquaint him with my presence, finish the meal the custom-house
officers had interrupted, and profit by the threatened storm to return
to the Rhone, and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew. I
stepped into the shed, and it was fortunate I did so, for at that moment
Caderousse entered with a stranger.</p>

<p id="id04364">"I waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because I could
do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often before. The
man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the South of
France; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at
the Beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair lasts, and during
which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all
parts of Europe, often have dealings to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000
francs. Caderousse entered hastily. Then, seeing that the room was,
as usual, empty, and only guarded by the dog, he called to his wife,
'Hello, Carconte,' said he, 'the worthy priest has not deceived us; the
diamond is real.' An exclamation of joy was heard, and the staircase
creaked beneath a feeble step. 'What do you say?' asked his wife, pale
as death.</p>

<p id="id04365">"'I say that the diamond is real, and that this gentleman, one of the
first jewellers of Paris, will give us 50,000. francs for it. Only, in
order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us, he wishes you to
relate to him, as I have done already, the miraculous manner in which
the diamond came into our possession. In the meantime please to sit
down, monsieur, and I will fetch you some refreshment.' The jeweller
examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty
of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have
come from the casket of a prince. 'Relate your story, madame,' said he,
wishing, no doubt, to profit by the absence of the husband, so that the
latter could not influence the wife's story, to see if the two recitals
tallied.</p>

<p id="id04366">"'Oh,' returned she, 'it was a gift of heaven. My husband was a great
friend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named Edmond Dantes. This poor
fellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at his
death he bequeathed this diamond to him.'&#8212;'But how did he obtain
it?' asked the jeweller; 'had he it before he was imprisoned?'&#8212;'No,
monsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a
rich Englishman, and as in prison he fell sick, and Dantes took the same
care of him as if he had been his brother, the Englishman, when he was
set free, gave this stone to Dantes, who, less fortunate, died, and, in
his turn, left it to us, and charged the excellent abbe, who was here
this morning, to deliver it.'&#8212;'The same story,' muttered the jeweller;
'and improbable as it seemed at first, it may be true. There's only
the price we are not agreed about.'&#8212;'How not agreed about?' said
Caderousse. 'I thought we agreed for the price I asked.'&#8212;'That is,'
replied the jeweller, 'I offered 40,000 francs.'&#8212;'Forty thousand,'
cried La Carconte; 'we will not part with it for that sum. The abbe told
us it was worth 50,000. without the setting.'</p>

<p id="id04367">"'What was the abbe's name?' asked the indefatigable questioner.&#8212;'The
Abbe Busoni,' said La Carconte.&#8212;'He was a foreigner?'&#8212;'An Italian,
from the neighborhood of Mantua, I believe.'&#8212;'Let me see this diamond
again,' replied the jeweller; 'the first time you are often mistaken as
to the value of a stone.' Caderousse took from his pocket a small case
of black shagreen, opened, and gave it to the jeweller. At the sight
of the diamond, which was as large as a hazel-nut, La Carconte's eyes
sparkled with cupidity."</p>

<p id="id04368">"And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?" said Monte<br>

Cristo; "did you credit it?"<br></p>

<p id="id04369">"Yes, your excellency. I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man, and I
thought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft."</p>

<p id="id04370">"That did more honor to your heart than to your experience, M.<br>

Bertuccio. Had you known this Edmond Dantes, of whom they spoke?"<br></p>

<p id="id04371">"No, your excellency, I had never heard of him before, and never but
once afterwards, and that was from the Abbe Busoni himself, when I saw
him in the prison at Nimes."</p>

<p id="id04372">"Go on."</p>

<p id="id04373">"The jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel
pliers and a small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of its
setting, and weighed it carefully. 'I will give you 45,000,' said he,
'but not a sou more; besides, as that is the exact value of the stone,
I brought just that sum with me.'&#8212;'Oh, that's no matter,' replied
Caderousse, 'I will go back with you to fetch the other 5,000
francs.'&#8212;'No,' returned the jeweller, giving back the diamond and the
ring to Caderousse&#8212;'no, it is worth no more, and I am sorry I offered
so much, for the stone has a flaw in it, which I had not seen. However,
I will not go back on my word, and I will give 45,000.'&#8212;'At least,
replace the diamond in the ring,' said La Carconte sharply.&#8212;'Ah, true,'
replied the jeweller, and he reset the stone.&#8212;'No matter,' observed
Caderousse, replacing the box in his pocket, 'some one else will
purchase it.'&#8212;'Yes,' continued the jeweller; 'but some one else will
not be so easy as I am, or content himself with the same story. It is
not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond. He will
inform against you. You will have to find the Abbe Busoni; and abbes who
give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare. The law would seize it,
and put you in prison; if at the end of three or four months you are set
at liberty, the ring will be lost, or a false stone, worth three francs,
will be given you, instead of a diamond worth 50,000 or perhaps 55,000
francs; from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk
in purchasing.' Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each
other.&#8212;'No,' said Caderousse, 'we are not rich enough to lose 5,000
francs.'&#8212;'As you please, my dear sir,' said the jeweller; 'I had,
however, as you see, brought you the money in bright coin.' And he drew
from his pocket a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the
dazzled eyes of the innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of
bank-notes.</p>

<p id="id04374">"There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse; it was
plain that the small shagreen case, which he turned over and over in
his hand, did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous
sum which fascinated his gaze. He turned towards his wife. 'What do you
think of this?' he asked in a low voice.&#8212;'Let him have it&#8212;let him have
it,' she said. 'If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond, he will
inform against us, and, as he says, who knows if we shall ever again see
the Abbe Busoni?&#8212;in all probability we shall never see him.'&#8212;'Well,
then, so I will!' said Caderousse; 'so you may have the diamond for
45,000 francs. But my wife wants a gold chain, and I want a pair of
silver buckles.' The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box,
which contained several samples of the articles demanded. 'Here,' he
said, 'I am very straightforward in my dealings&#8212;take your choice.' The
woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the husband a
pair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.&#8212;'I hope you will not
complain now?' said the jeweller.</p>

<p id="id04375">"'The abbe told me it was worth 50,000 francs,' muttered Caderousse.
'Come, come&#8212;give it to me! What a strange fellow you are,' said
the jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand. 'I give you 45,000
francs&#8212;that is, 2,500 livres of income,&#8212;a fortune such as I wish I had
myself, and you are not satisfied!'&#8212;'And the five and forty thousand
francs,' inquired Caderousse in a hoarse voice, 'where are they?
Come&#8212;let us see them.'&#8212;'Here they are,' replied the jeweller, and he
counted out upon the table 15,000. francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in
bank-notes.</p>

<p id="id04376">"'Wait while I light the lamp,' said La Carconte; 'it is growing dark,
and there may be some mistake.' In fact, night had come on during this
conversation, and with night the storm which had been threatening for
the last half-hour. The thunder growled in the distance; but it was
apparently not heard by the jeweller, Caderousse, or La Carconte,
absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain. I myself felt; a
strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these
bank-notes; it seemed to me that I was in a dream, and, as it always
happens in a dream, I felt myself riveted to the spot. Caderousse
counted and again counted the gold and the notes, then handed them to
his wife, who counted and counted them again in her turn. During this
time, the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight,
and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those
which&#8212;precursors of the storm&#8212;began to play in at the windows. 'Well,'
inquired the jeweller, 'is the cash all right?'</p>

<p id="id04377">"'Yes,' said Caderousse. 'Give me the pocket-book, La Carconte, and find
a bag somewhere.'</p>

<p id="id04378">"La Carconte went to a cupboard, and returned with an old leathern
pocket-book and a bag. From the former she took some greasy letters, and
put in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or three
crowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the entire
fortune of the miserable couple. 'There,' said Caderousse; 'and now,
although you have wronged us of perhaps 10,000 francs, will you have
your supper with us? I invite you with good-will.'&#8212;'Thank you,'
replied the jeweller, 'it must be getting late, and I must return to
Beaucaire&#8212;my wife will be getting uneasy.' He drew out his watch, and
exclaimed, 'Morbleu, nearly nine o'clock&#8212;why, I shall not get back to
Beaucaire before midnight! Good-night, my friends. If the Abbe Busoni
should by any accident return, think of me.'&#8212;'In another week you will
have left Beaucaire.' remarked Caderousse, 'for the fair ends in a few
days.'&#8212;'True, but that makes no difference. Write to me at Paris, to
M. Joannes, in the Palais Royal, arcade Pierre, No. 45. I will make the
journey on purpose to see him, if it is worth while.' At this moment
there was a tremendous clap of thunder, accompanied by a flash of
lightning so vivid, that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp.</p>

<p id="id04379">"'See here,' exclaimed Caderousse. 'You cannot think of going out in
such weather as this.'&#8212;'Oh, I am not afraid of thunder,' said the
jeweller.&#8212;'And then there are robbers,' said La Carconte. 'The road
is never very safe during fair time.'&#8212;'Oh, as to the robbers,' said
Joannes, 'here is something for them,' and he drew from his pocket a
pair of small pistols, loaded to the muzzle. 'Here,' said he, 'are dogs
who bark and bite at the same time, they are for the two first who shall
have a longing for your diamond, Friend Caderousse.'</p>

<p id="id04380">"Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look. It seemed
as though they were both inspired at the same time with some
horrible thought. 'Well, then, a good journey to you,' said
Caderousse.&#8212;'Thanks,' replied the jeweller. He then took his cane,
which he had placed against an old cupboard, and went out. At the moment
when he opened the door, such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was
nearly extinguished. 'Oh,' said he, 'this is very nice weather, and two
leagues to go in such a storm.'&#8212;'Remain,' said Caderousse. 'You can
sleep here.'&#8212;'Yes; do stay,' added La Carconte in a tremulous voice;
'we will take every care of you.'&#8212;'No; I must sleep at Beaucaire. So,
once more, good-night.' Caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold.
'I can see neither heaven nor earth,' said the jeweller, who was outside
the door. 'Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?'&#8212;'To the
right,' said Caderousse. 'You cannot go wrong&#8212;the road is bordered by
trees on both sides.'&#8212;'Good&#8212;all right,' said a voice almost lost in
the distance. 'Close the door,' said La Carconte; 'I do not like open
doors when it thunders.'&#8212;'Particularly when there is money in the
house, eh?' answered Caderousse, double-locking the door.</p>

<p id="id04381">"He came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and
pocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold and
bank-notes. I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering
lamp revealed in those two countenances. The woman, especially,
was hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified, her
countenance had become livid, and her eyes resembled burning coals.
'Why,' she inquired in a hoarse voice, 'did you invite him to sleep here
to-night?'&#8212;'Why?' said Caderousse with a shudder; 'why, that he might
not have the trouble of returning to Beaucaire.'&#8212;'Ah,' responded the
woman, with an expression impossible to describe; 'I thought it was
for something else.'&#8212;'Woman, woman&#8212;why do you have such ideas?'
cried Caderousse; 'or, if you have them, why don't you keep them to
yourself?'&#8212;'Well,' said La Carconte, after a moment's pause, 'you are
not a man.'&#8212;'What do you mean?' added Caderousse.&#8212;'If you had been a
man, you would not have let him go from here.'&#8212;'Woman!'&#8212;'Or else
he should not have reached Beaucaire.'&#8212;'Woman!'&#8212;'The road takes a
turn&#8212;he is obliged to follow it&#8212;while alongside of the canal there is
a shorter road.'&#8212;'Woman!&#8212;you offend the good God. There&#8212;listen!' And
at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the livid
lightning illumined the room, and the thunder, rolling away in the
distance, seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode. 'Mercy!'
said Caderousse, crossing himself.</p>

<p id="id04382">"At the same moment, and in the midst of the terrifying silence which
usually follows a clap of thunder, they heard a knocking at the door.
Caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other. 'Who's
there?' cried Caderousse, rising, and drawing up in a heap the gold
and notes scattered over the table, and which he covered with his two
hands.&#8212;'It is I,' shouted a voice.&#8212;'And who are you?'&#8212;'Eh, pardieu,
Joannes, the jeweller.'&#8212;'Well, and you said I offended the good God,'
said La Carconte with a horrid smile. 'Why, the good God sends him back
again.' Caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair. La Carconte,
on the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards the door,
opened it, saying, as she did so&#8212;'Come in, dear M. Joannes.'&#8212;'Ma foi,'
said the jeweller, drenched with rain, 'I am not destined to return to
Beaucaire to-night. The shortest follies are best, my dear Caderousse.
You offered me hospitality, and I accept it, and have returned to sleep
beneath your friendly roof.' Caderousse stammered out something,
while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow. La Carconte
double-locked the door behind the jeweller."</p>

<h3 id="id04383" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 45. The Rain of Blood.</h3>

<p id="id04384">"As the jeweller returned to the apartment, he cast around him a
scrutinizing glance&#8212;but there was nothing to excite suspicion, if
it did not exist, or to confirm it, if it were already awakened.
Caderousse's hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes, and La
Carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance
of their guest. 'Well, well,' said the jeweller, 'you seem, my good
friends, to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money,
by counting it over so carefully directly I was gone.'&#8212;'Oh, no,'
answered Caderousse, 'that was not my reason, I can assure you; but the
circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so
unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune, and it is
only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that
we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream.' The
jeweller smiled.&#8212;'Have you any other guests in your house?' inquired
he.&#8212;'Nobody but ourselves,' replied Caderousse; 'the fact is, we do not
lodge travellers&#8212;indeed, our tavern is so near the town, that nobody
would think of stopping here.'&#8212;'Then I am afraid I shall very much
inconvenience you.'&#8212;'Inconvenience us? Not at all, my dear sir,'
said La Carconte in her most gracious manner. 'Not at all, I assure
you.'&#8212;'But where will you manage to stow me?'&#8212;'In the chamber
overhead.'&#8212;'Surely that is where you yourselves sleep?'&#8212;'Never mind
that; we have a second bed in the adjoining room.' Caderousse stared at
his wife with much astonishment.</p>

<p id="id04385">"The jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his
back at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her
guest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his supper,
by spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on it the
slender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or four
fresh-laid eggs. Caderousse had once more parted with his treasure&#8212;the
banknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put back into
the bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. He then began
pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from time to
time at the jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his wet
clothes, and merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to enable the
whole of his garments to be dried.</p>

<p id="id04386">"'There,' said La Carconte, as she placed a bottle of wine on the table,
'supper is ready whenever you are.'&#8212;'And you?' asked Joannes.&#8212;'I don't
want any supper,' said Caderousse.&#8212;'We dined so very late,' hastily
interposed La Carconte.&#8212;'Then it seems I am to eat alone,' remarked
the jeweller.&#8212;'Oh, we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you,'
answered La Carconte, with an eager attention she was not accustomed to
manifest even to guests who paid for what they took.</p>

<p id="id04387">"From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching
glances, but rapid as the lightning flash. The storm still continued.
'There, there,' said La Carconte; 'do you hear that? upon my word, you
did well to come back.'&#8212;'Nevertheless,' replied the jeweller, 'if by
the time I have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated, I
shall make another start.'&#8212;'It's the mistral,' said Caderousse, 'and
it will be sure to last till to-morrow morning.' He sighed
heavily.&#8212;'Well,' said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table,
'all I can say is, so much the worse for those who are abroad.'&#8212;'Yes,'
chimed in La Carconte, 'they will have a wretched night of it.'</p>

<p id="id04388">"The jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was ordinarily
so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was suddenly
transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. Had the unhappy
man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with
her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his
mind, or at least have greatly astonished him. Caderousse, meanwhile,
continued to pace the room in gloomy silence, sedulously avoiding
the sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger had completed his
repast, the agitated inn-keeper went eagerly to the door and opened
it. 'I believe the storm is over,' said he. But as if to contradict his
statement, at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the
house to its very foundation, while a sudden gust of wind, mingled
with rain, extinguished the lamp he held in his hand. Trembling and
awe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his
guest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that
glimmered on the hearth. 'You must be tired,' said she to the jeweller;
'I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed; go up when you are
ready, and sleep well.'</p>

<p id="id04389">"Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in
its fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that,
instead of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily
increased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed inevitable, he
bade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. He passed over my head
and I heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps. The quick, eager
glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended, while Caderousse, on
the contrary, turned his back, and seemed most anxiously to avoid even
glancing at him.</p>

<p id="id04390">"All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as
they have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the exception
of the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air of
improbability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither
apprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as I was with fatigue, and
fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated, I
determined to obtain a few hours' sleep. Overhead I could accurately
distinguish every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best
arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night, threw himself
on his bed, and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight.
Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having
no suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked
into the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a
long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are
frequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me, so
that I could not see the expression of his countenance&#8212;neither should I
have been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his head was
buried between his two hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on him for
some time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat immediately
opposite to him. At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh
flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright
light flashed over the room. La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed
on her husband, but as he made no sign of changing his position, she
extended her hard, bony hand, and touched him on the forehead.</p>

<p id="id04391">"Caderousse shuddered. The woman's lips seemed to move, as though she
were talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or my senses
were dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered. Confused
sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I fell into
a deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this unconscious state
I know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol,
followed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across
the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull, heavy weight seemed
to fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet fully recovered
consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with half-stifled
cries, as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A cry more
prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually
roused me from my drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself on one arm, I
looked around, but all was dark; and it seemed to me as if the rain must
have penetrated through the flooring of the room above, for some kind
of moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon my forehead, and when I
passed my hand across my brow, I felt that it was wet and clammy.</p>

<p id="id04392">"To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most
perfect silence&#8212;unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking about
in the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the room
below, approached the fire and lit a candle. The man was Caderousse&#8212;he
was pale and his shirt was all bloody. Having obtained the light, he
hurried up-stairs again, and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy
footsteps. A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the
small shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained
the diamond,&#8212;seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it
in, then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he
deposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round
his head. After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold
he had put there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and
the other into that of his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of
linen, and rushing towards the door, disappeared in the darkness of the
night.</p>

<p id="id04393">"Then all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself
with what had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed.
I fancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the
unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his
relief, by way of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I had
committed, but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For this
purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance
from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room. The poorly
fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts,
and I found myself in the house. Hastily snatching up the lighted
candle, I hurried to the staircase; about midway a body was lying quite
across the stairs. It was that of La Carconte. The pistol I had heard
had doubtless been fired at her. The shot had frightfully lacerated her
throat, leaving two gaping wounds from which, as well as the mouth, the
blood was pouring in floods. She was stone dead. I strode past her, and
ascended to the sleeping chamber, which presented an appearance of the
wildest disorder. The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly
struggle that had taken place there, and the sheets, to which the
unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were dragged across the room.
The murdered man lay on the floor, his head leaning against the wall,
and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large
wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in which a long table
knife was plunged up to the handle.</p>

<p id="id04394">"I stumbled over some object; I stooped to examine&#8212;it was the second
pistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet. I
approached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my
footsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed
them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though
trying to speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired.
This appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses, and finding that I
could no longer be of service to any one in the house, my only desire
was to fly. I rushed towards the staircase, clutching my hair, and
uttering a groan of horror. Upon reaching the room below, I found five
or six custom-house officers, and two or three gendarmes&#8212;all heavily
armed. They threw themselves upon me. I made no resistance; I was no
longer master of my senses. When I strove to speak, a few inarticulate
sounds alone escaped my lips.</p>

<p id="id04395">"As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to
my blood-stained garments, I involuntarily surveyed myself, and then
I discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I lay
beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte. I pointed
to the spot where I had concealed myself. 'What does he mean?' asked a
gendarme. One of the officers went to the place I directed. 'He means,'
replied the man upon his return, 'that he got in that way;' and he
showed the hole I had made when I broke through.</p>

<p id="id04396">"Then I saw that they took me for the assassin. I recovered force and
energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me, while
I managed to stammer forth&#8212;'I did not do it! Indeed, indeed I did not!'
A couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my
breast.&#8212;'Stir but a step,' said they, 'and you are a dead man.'&#8212;'Why
should you threaten me with death,' cried I, 'when I have already
declared my innocence?'&#8212;'Tush, tush,' cried the men; 'keep your
innocent stories to tell to the judge at Nimes. Meanwhile, come along
with us; and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly.'
Alas, resistance was far from my thoughts. I was utterly overpowered
by surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be
handcuffed and tied to a horse's tail, and thus they took me to Nimes.</p>

<p id="id04397">"I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near
the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he
had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to
hear the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such
circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving
my innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of
beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry
to be made for the Abbe Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont
du Gard on that morning. If Caderousse had invented the story relative
to the diamond, and there existed no such person as the Abbe Busoni,
then, indeed, I was lost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung
upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended
and confessing the whole truth. Two months passed away in hopeless
expectation on my part, while I must do the magistrate the justice
to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person I
declared could exculpate me if he would. Caderousse still evaded all
pursuit, and I had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate.
My trial was to come on at the approaching assizes; when, on the 8th of
September&#8212;that is to say, precisely three months and five days after
the events which had perilled my life&#8212;the Abbe Busoni, whom I never
ventured to believe I should see, presented himself at the prison doors,
saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him;
he added, that having learned at Marseilles the particulars of my
imprisonment, he hastened to comply with my desire. You may easily
imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how minutely I
related the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some degree of
nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond, but, to my
inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every particular, and to
my equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief in all I said. And
then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was acquainted
with all the habits and customs of my own country, and considering also
that pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come
with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind, I besought him to
receive my confession, under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil
affair in all its details, as well as every other transaction of my
life. That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced
the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation. My
voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that
I had not committed that of which I stood accused. When he quitted me,
he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his doing all in his
power to convince my judges of my innocence.</p>

<p id="id04398">"I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbe was engaged in my behalf,
for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling
though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be
postponed to the assizes following those now being held. In the interim
it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of Caderousse, who was
discovered in some distant country, and brought back to France, where he
made a full confession, refusing to make the fact of his wife's having
suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt.
The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life, and I was
immediately set at liberty."</p>

<p id="id04399">"And then it was, I presume," said Monte Cristo "that you came to me as
the bearer of a letter from the Abbe Busoni?"</p>

<p id="id04400">"It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbe took an evident interest
in all that concerned me.</p>

<p id="id04401">"'Your mode of life as a smuggler,' said he to me one day, 'will be
the ruin of you; if you get out, don't take it up again.'&#8212;'But how,'
inquired I, 'am I to maintain myself and my poor sister?'</p>

<p id="id04402">"'A person, whose confessor I am,' replied he, 'and who entertains a
high regard for me, applied to me a short time since to procure him a
confidential servant. Would you like such a post? If so, I will give you
a letter of introduction to him.'&#8212;'Oh, father,' I exclaimed, 'you are
very good.'</p>

<p id="id04403">"'But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent
my recommendation.' I extended my hand, and was about to pledge myself
by any promise he would dictate, but he stopped me. 'It is unnecessary
for you to bind yourself by any vow,' said he; 'I know and admire the
Corsican nature too well to fear you. Here, take this,' continued he,
after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency, and
upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service,
and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent
having done so?"</p>

<p id="id04404">"No," replied the count; "I take pleasure in saying that you have served
me faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more confidence in
me."</p>

<p id="id04405">"I, your excellency?"</p>

<p id="id04406">"Yes; you. How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted son,
you have never spoken to me of either?"</p>

<p id="id04407">"Alas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life.
Anxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister,
I lost no time in hastening to Corsica, but when I arrived at Rogliano I
found a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so horrible that
the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. Acting by my advice,
my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of
Benedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as long as he
believed there was a sou left in her possession. One morning that he had
demanded money, threatening her with the severest consequences if she
did not supply him with what he desired, he disappeared and remained
away all day, leaving the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he
were her own child, to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence.
Evening came, and still, with all the patient solicitude of a mother,
she watched for his return.</p>

<p id="id04408">"As the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air, attended
by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions. She
stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of her, and one of
the three&#8212;none other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed,&#8212;'Put her
to torture and she'll soon tell us where her money is.'</p>

<p id="id04409">"It unfortunately happened that our neighbor, Vasilio, was at Bastia,
leaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature beside
could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. Two held
poor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her,
smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners.
The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows, then returned,
and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the
sight of these preparations, and then dragged Assunta feet foremost
towards the brazier, expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her
supposed treasure was secreted. In the struggle her clothes caught
fire, and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve
themselves from sharing the same fate. Covered with flames, Assunta
rushed wildly to the door, but it was fastened; she flew to the windows,
but they were also secured; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks;
it was Assunta calling for help. The cries died away in groans, and next
morning, as soon as Vasilio's wife could muster up courage to venture
abroad, she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public
authorities, when Assunta, although dreadfully burnt, was found still
breathing; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open,
and the money stolen. Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano,
neither have I since that day either seen or heard anything concerning
him.</p>

<p id="id04410">"It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on
your excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned
Benedetto, since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister,
since she was dead."</p>

<p id="id04411">"And in what light did you view the occurrence?" inquired Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04412">"As a punishment for the crime I had committed," answered Bertuccio.<br>

"Oh, those Villeforts are an accursed race!"<br></p>

<p id="id04413">"Truly they are," murmured the count in a lugubrious tone.</p>

<p id="id04414">"And now," resumed Bertuccio, "your excellency may, perhaps, be able
to comprehend that this place, which I revisit for the first time&#8212;this
garden, the actual scene of my crime&#8212;must have given rise to
reflections of no very agreeable nature, and produced that gloom and
depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency, who
was pleased to express a desire to know the cause. At this instant a
shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on
the very grave in which lies M. de Villefort, by whose hand the ground
was dug to receive the corpse of his child."</p>

<p id="id04415">"Everything is possible," said Monte Cristo, rising from the bench on
which he had been sitting; "even," he added in an inaudible voice, "even
that the procureur be not dead. The Abbe Busoni did right to send you
to me," he went on in his ordinary tone, "and you have done well in
relating to me the whole of your history, as it will prevent my forming
any erroneous opinions concerning you in future. As for that Benedetto,
who so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace
out whither he has gone, or what has become of him?"</p>

<p id="id04416">"No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I should
shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank God,
I have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and
believe he is dead."</p>

<p id="id04417">"Do not think so, Bertuccio," replied the count; "for the wicked are
not so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under his special
watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance."</p>

<p id="id04418">"So be it," responded Bertuccio, "all I ask of heaven is that I may
never see him again. And now, your excellency," he added, bowing his
head, "you know everything&#8212;you are my judge on earth, as the Almighty
is in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation?"</p>

<p id="id04419">"My good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the
Abbe Busoni. Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you,
and, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the
instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly
punished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but
one point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore, after
rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its
mother? There was the crime, Bertuccio&#8212;that was where you became really
culpable."</p>

<p id="id04420">"True, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that
I acted like a coward. My first duty, directly I had succeeded in
recalling the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in
order to do so, I must have made close and careful inquiry, which would,
in all probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung to
life, partly on my sister's account, and partly from that feeling
of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and
victorious in the execution of our vengeance. Perhaps, too, the natural
and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my
own. And then, again, I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor
brother." Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words,
while Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning. After
a brief silence, rendered still more solemn by the time and place, the
count said, in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner, "In
order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination (the last we
shall ever hold upon this subject), I will repeat to you some words I
have heard from the lips of the Abbe Busoni. For all evils there are
two remedies&#8212;time and silence. And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to
walk alone here in the garden. The very circumstances which inflict
on you, as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here, such painful
emotions, are to me, on the contrary, a source of something like
contentment, and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my
estimation. The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of
their umbrageous boughs, while fancy pictures a moving multitude of
shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade. Here I have
a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the
imagination, and furnished with thickly grown trees, beneath whose leafy
screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will. This to
me, who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight
wall, is, I assure you, a most agreeable surprise. I have no fear of
ghosts, and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done
by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a
single day. Retire within, Bertuccio, and tranquillize your mind. Should
your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you
found the Abbe Busoni, send for me, if I am still on earth, and I will
soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your
parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity."</p>

<p id="id04421">Bertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily. Monte
Cristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured,
"Here, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infant's grave
was dug. There is the little door opening into the garden. At this
corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping
apartment. There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these
particulars, for there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me,
I have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth." After
making the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered his
carriage, while Bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression of
his master's features, took his seat beside the driver without uttering
a word. The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris.</p>

<p id="id04422">That same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs Elysees, the
Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one
long acquainted with each nook or corner. Nor, although preceding the
party, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest
error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him
to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. Ali was his principal
attendant during this nocturnal survey. Having given various orders to
Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired
to make in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the
attentive Nubian, "It is half-past eleven o'clock; Haidee will soon be
here. Have the French attendants been summoned to await her coming?" Ali
extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek,
which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance,
that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their
existence. Ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three fingers
of his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut his eyes,
and feigned to sleep. "I understand," said Monte Cristo, well acquainted
with Ali's pantomime; "you mean to tell me that three female
attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping-chamber." Ali, with
considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.</p>

<p id="id04423">"Madame will be tired to-night," continued Monte Cristo, "and will, no
doubt, wish to rest. Desire the French attendants not to weary her with
questions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire. You will
also see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of
this country." He bowed. Just at that moment voices were heard hailing
the concierge. The gate opened, a carriage rolled down the avenue, and
stopped at the steps. The count hastily descended, presented himself
at the already opened carriage door, and held out his hand to a young
woman, completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered
with gold. She raised the hand extended towards her to her lips, and
kissed it with a mixture of love and respect. Some few words passed
between them in that sonorous language in which Homer makes his gods
converse. The young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness,
while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity. Preceded by Ali,
who carried a rose-colored flambeau in his hand, the new-comer, who was
no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte Cristo's companion in
Italy, was conducted to her apartments, while the count retired to the
pavilion reserved for himself. In another hour every light in the house
was extinguished, and it might have been thought that all its inmates
slept.</p>

<h3 id="id04424" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit.</h3>

<p id="id04425">About two o'clock the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of
magnificent English horses, stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a
person, dressed in a blue coat, with buttons of a similar color, a
white waistcoat, over which was displayed a massive gold chain, brown
trousers, and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his
eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so
little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles
stamped on his features&#8212;a person, in a word, who, although evidently
past fifty, desired to be taken for not more than forty, bent forwards
from the carriage door, on the panels of which were emblazoned the
armorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to inquire at the
porter's lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there, and if
he were within. While waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the
house, the garden as far as he could distinguish it, and the livery
of servants who passed to and fro, with an attention so close as to be
somewhat impertinent. His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than
intelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin that, as they closed,
they were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones were broad and
projecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and craftiness; while the
flatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the back of his skull,
which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears, combined
to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the eyes of
such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs
be all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when they gazed
on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the red ribbon
that depended from his button-hole.</p>

<p id="id04426">The groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the
porter's lodge, saying, "Pray, does not the Count of Monte Cristo live
here?"</p>

<p id="id04427">"His excellency does reside here," replied the concierge; "but"&#8212;added
he, glancing an inquiring look at Ali. Ali returned a sign in the
negative. "But what?" asked the groom.</p>

<p id="id04428">"His excellency does not receive visitors to-day."</p>

<p id="id04429">"Then here is my master's card,&#8212;the Baron Danglars. You will take it
to the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the Chamber, my
master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him."</p>

<p id="id04430">"I never speak to his excellency," replied the concierge; "the valet de
chambre will carry your message." The groom returned to the carriage.
"Well?" asked Danglars. The man, somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke he
had received, repeated what the concierge had said. "Bless me," murmured
Baron Danglars, "this must surely be a prince instead of a count by
their styling him 'excellency,' and only venturing to address him by the
medium of his valet de chambre. However, it does not signify; he has a
letter of credit on me, so I must see him when he requires his money."</p>

<p id="id04431">Then, throwing himself back in his carriage, Danglars called out to
his coachman, in a voice that might be heard across the road, "To the
Chamber of Deputies."</p>

<p id="id04432">Apprised in time of the visit paid him, Monte Cristo had, from behind
the blinds of his pavilion, as minutely observed the baron, by means of
an excellent lorgnette, as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house,
garden, and servants. "That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance,"
said the count in a tone of disgust, as he shut up his glass into its
ivory case. "How comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight
of that flat, receding, serpent-like forehead, round, vulture-shaped
head, and sharp-hooked nose, like the beak of a buzzard? Ali," cried
he, striking at the same time on the brazen gong. Ali appeared. "Summon
Bertuccio," said the count. Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the
apartment. "Did your excellency desire to see me?" inquired he. "I did,"
replied the count. "You no doubt observed the horses standing a few
minutes since at the door?"</p>

<p id="id04433">"Certainly, your excellency. I noticed them for their remarkable
beauty."</p>

<p id="id04434">"Then how comes it," said Monte Cristo with a frown, "that, when I
desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in
Paris, there is another pair, fully as fine as mine, not in my stables?"
At the look of displeasure, added to the angry tone in which the count
spoke, Ali turned pale and held down his head. "It is not your fault, my
good Ali," said the count in the Arabic language, and with a gentleness
none would have thought him capable of showing, either in voice or
face&#8212;"it is not your fault. You do not understand the points of English
horses." The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity. "Permit me
to assure your excellency," said Bertuccio, "that the horses you speak
of were not to be sold when I purchased yours." Monte Cristo shrugged
his shoulders. "It seems, sir steward," said he, "that you have yet to
learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price."</p>

<p id="id04435">"His excellency is not, perhaps, aware that M. Danglars gave 16,000
francs for his horses?"</p>

<p id="id04436">"Very well. Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an
opportunity of doubling his capital."</p>

<p id="id04437">"Is your excellency really in earnest?" inquired the steward. Monte
Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with
the look of one equally surprised and displeased. "I have to pay a visit
this evening," replied he. "I desire that these horses, with completely
new harness, may be at the door with my carriage." Bertuccio bowed, and
was about to retire; but when he reached the door, he paused, and then
said, "At what o'clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses
to be ready?"</p>

<p id="id04438">"At five o'clock," replied the count.</p>

<p id="id04439">"I beg your excellency's pardon," interposed the steward in a
deprecating manner, "for venturing to observe that it is already two
o'clock."</p>

<p id="id04440">"I am perfectly aware of that fact," answered Monte Cristo calmly. Then,
turning towards Ali, he said, "Let all the horses in my stables be led
before the windows of your young lady, that she may select those she
prefers for her carriage. Request her also to oblige me by saying
whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be served
in her apartments. Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to
come hither." Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the
chamber. "Monsieur Baptistin," said the count, "you have been in my
service one year, the time I generally give myself to judge of the
merits or demerits of those about me. You suit me very well." Baptistin
bowed low. "It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you?"</p>

<p id="id04441">"Oh, your excellency!" exclaimed Baptistin eagerly.</p>

<p id="id04442">"Listen, if you please, till I have finished speaking," replied Monte
Cristo. "You receive 1,500 francs per annum for your services here&#8212;more
than many a brave subaltern, who continually risks his life for his
country, obtains. You live in a manner far superior to many clerks who
work ten times harder than you do for their money. Then, though yourself
a servant, you have other servants to wait upon you, take care of your
clothes, and see that your linen is duly prepared for you. Again, you
make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet, amounting in
the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages."</p>

<p id="id04443">"Nay, indeed, your excellency."</p>

<p id="id04444">"I am not condemning you for this, Monsieur Baptistin; but let your
profits end here. It would be long indeed ere you would find so
lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill. I
neither ill-use nor ill-treat my servants by word or action. An error
I readily forgive, but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never. My
commands are ordinarily short, clear, and precise; and I would rather be
obliged to repeat my words twice, or even three times, than they should
be misunderstood. I am rich enough to know whatever I desire to know,
and I can promise you I am not wanting in curiosity. If, then, I
should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to any one
favorably or unfavorably, to comment on my actions, or watch my conduct,
that very instant you would quit my service. You may now retire. I never
caution my servants a second time&#8212;remember that." Baptistin bowed, and
was proceeding towards the door. "I forgot to mention to you," said the
count, "that I lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my
establishment; those whom I am compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of
course) all participation in this money, while their portion goes to the
fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me, and among whom
it will be divided at my death. You have been in my service a year, your
fund has already begun to accumulate&#8212;let it continue to do so."</p>

<p id="id04445">This address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding
one word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved,
produced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have
occasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics. "I
assure your excellency," said he, "that at least it shall be my study
to merit your approbation in all things, and I will take M. Ali as my
model."</p>

<p id="id04446">"By no means," replied the count in the most frigid tones; "Ali has many
faults mixed with most excellent qualities. He cannot possibly serve you
as a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a paid servant,
but a mere slave&#8212;a dog, who, should he fail in his duty towards me, I
should not discharge from my service, but kill." Baptistin opened his
eyes with astonishment.</p>

<p id="id04447">"You seem incredulous," said Monte Cristo, who repeated to Ali in the
Arabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French. The
Nubian smiled assentingly to his master's words, then, kneeling on one
knee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count. This corroboration of
the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder
and stupefaction of M. Baptistin. The count then motioned the valet
de chambre to retire, and to Ali to follow to his study, where they
conversed long and earnestly together. As the hand of the clock pointed
to five the count struck thrice upon his gong. When Ali was wanted
one stroke was given, two summoned Baptistin, and three Bertuccio. The
steward entered. "My horses," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04448">"They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency
desired. Does your excellency wish me to accompany him?"</p>

<p id="id04449">"No, the coachman, Ali, and Baptistin will go." The count descended to
the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage drawn by the very
pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property
of Danglars. As he passed them he said&#8212;"They are extremely handsome
certainly, and you have done well to purchase them, although you were
somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner."</p>

<p id="id04450">"Indeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in
obtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price."</p>

<p id="id04451">"Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,"
inquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p id="id04452">"Nay, if your excellency is satisfied, it is all that I could wish.<br>

Whither does your excellency desire to be driven?"<br></p>

<p id="id04453">"To the residence of Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin." This
conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which a
flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive. As Bertuccio, with
a respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back. "I have
another commission for you, M. Bertuccio," said he; "I am desirous of
having an estate by the seaside in Normandy&#8212;for instance, between Havre
and Boulogne. You see I give you a wide range. It will be absolutely
necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor, creek, or
bay, into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor. She draws
only fifteen feet. She must be kept in constant readiness to sail
immediately I think proper to give the signal. Make the requisite
inquiries for a place of this description, and when you have met with
an eligible spot, visit it, and if it possess the advantages desired,
purchase it at once in your own name. The corvette must now, I think, be
on her way to Fecamp, must she not?"</p>
