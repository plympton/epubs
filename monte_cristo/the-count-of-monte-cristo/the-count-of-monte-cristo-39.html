<p id="id10959">"The result was that the two men communicated with one another; how long
they did so, nobody knows. One day the old man fell ill and died. Now
guess what the young one did?"</p>

<p id="id10960">"Tell me."</p>

<p id="id10961">"He carried off the corpse, which he placed in his own bed with its face
to the wall; then he entered the empty dungeon, closed the entrance, and
slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body. Did you ever
hear of such an idea?" Monte Cristo closed his eyes, and seemed again
to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas,
yet moist with the cold dews of death, had touched his face. The jailer
continued: "Now this was his project. He fancied that they buried the
dead at the Chateau d'If, and imagining they would not expend much labor
on the grave of a prisoner, he calculated on raising the earth with
his shoulders, but unfortunately their arrangements at the Chateau
frustrated his projects. They never buried the dead; they merely
attached a heavy cannon-ball to the feet, and then threw them into the
sea. This is what was done. The young man was thrown from the top of the
rock; the corpse was found on the bed next day, and the whole truth was
guessed, for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they
had not dared to speak of before, that at the moment the corpse was
thrown into the deep, they heard a shriek, which was almost immediately
stifled by the water in which it disappeared." The count breathed with
difficulty; the cold drops ran down his forehead, and his heart was full
of anguish.</p>

<p id="id10962">"No," he muttered, "the doubt I felt was but the commencement of
forgetfulness; but here the wound reopens, and the heart again thirsts
for vengeance. And the prisoner," he continued aloud, "was he ever heard
of afterwards?"</p>

<p id="id10963">"Oh, no; of course not. You can understand that one of two things must
have happened; he must either have fallen flat, in which case the blow,
from a height of ninety feet, must have killed him instantly, or he must
have fallen upright, and then the weight would have dragged him to the
bottom, where he remained&#8212;poor fellow!"</p>

<p id="id10964">"Then you pity him?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id10965">"Ma foi, yes; though he was in his own element."</p>

<p id="id10966">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id10967">"The report was that he had been a naval officer, who had been confined
for plotting with the Bonapartists."</p>

<p id="id10968">"Great is truth," muttered the count, "fire cannot burn, nor water drown
it! Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate
his history; his terrible story is recited in the chimney-corner, and a
shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be
swallowed by the deep." Then, the count added aloud, "Was his name ever
known?"</p>

<p id="id10969">"Oh, yes; but only as No. 34."</p>

<p id="id10970">"Oh, Villefort, Villefort," murmured the count, "this scene must often
have haunted thy sleepless hours!"</p>

<p id="id10971">"Do you wish to see anything more, sir?" said the concierge.</p>

<p id="id10972">"Yes, especially if you will show me the poor abbe's room."</p>

<p id="id10973">"Ah&#8212;No. 27."</p>

<p id="id10974">"Yes; No. 27." repeated the count, who seemed to hear the voice of the
abbe answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his
name.</p>

<p id="id10975">"Come, sir."</p>

<p id="id10976">"Wait," said Monte Cristo, "I wish to take one final glance around this
room."</p>

<p id="id10977">"This is fortunate," said the guide; "I have forgotten the other key."</p>

<p id="id10978">"Go and fetch it."</p>

<p id="id10979">"I will leave you the torch, sir."</p>

<p id="id10980">"No, take it away; I can see in the dark."</p>

<p id="id10981">"Why, you are like No. 34. They said he was so accustomed to darkness
that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon."</p>

<p id="id10982">"He spent fourteen years to arrive at that," muttered the count.</p>

<p id="id10983">The guide carried away the torch. The count had spoken correctly.
Scarcely had a few seconds elapsed, ere he saw everything as distinctly
as by daylight. Then he looked around him, and really recognized his
dungeon.</p>

<p id="id10984">"Yes," he said, "there is the stone upon which I used to sit; there is
the impression made by my shoulders on the wall; there is the mark of
my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the wall. Oh, those
figures, how well I remember them! I made them one day to calculate
the age of my father, that I might know whether I should find him still
living, and that of Mercedes, to know if I should find her still free.
After finishing that calculation, I had a minute's hope. I did not
reckon upon hunger and infidelity!" and a bitter laugh escaped the
count. He saw in fancy the burial of his father, and the marriage of
Mercedes. On the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription,
the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall. "'O
God,'" he read, "'preserve my memory!' Oh, yes," he cried, "that was
my only prayer at last; I no longer begged for liberty, but memory;
I dreaded to become mad and forgetful. O God, thou hast preserved my
memory; I thank thee, I thank thee!" At this moment the light of the
torch was reflected on the wall; the guide was coming; Monte Cristo went
to meet him.</p>

<p id="id10985">"Follow me, sir;" and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted
him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance. There, again, Monte
Cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts. The first thing that
met his eye was the meridian, drawn by the abbe on the wall, by which
he calculated the time; then he saw the remains of the bed on which
the poor prisoner had died. The sight of this, instead of exciting the
anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon, filled his heart with a
soft and grateful sentiment, and tears fell from his eyes.</p>

<p id="id10986">"This is where the mad abbe was kept, sir, and that is where the young
man entered;" and the guide pointed to the opening, which had remained
unclosed. "From the appearance of the stone," he continued, "a learned
gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together
for ten years. Poor things! Those must have been ten weary years."</p>

<p id="id10987">Dantes took some louis from his pocket, and gave them to the man who
had twice unconsciously pitied him. The guide took them, thinking them
merely a few pieces of little value; but the light of the torch revealed
their true worth. "Sir," he said, "you have made a mistake; you have
given me gold."</p>

<p id="id10988">"I know it." The concierge looked upon the count with surprise. "Sir,"
he cried, scarcely able to believe his good fortune&#8212;"sir, I cannot
understand your generosity!"</p>

<p id="id10989">"Oh, it is very simple, my good fellow; I have been a sailor, and your
story touched me more than it would others."</p>

<p id="id10990">"Then, sir, since you are so liberal, I ought to offer you something."</p>

<p id="id10991">"What have you to offer to me, my friend? Shells? Straw-work? Thank
you!"</p>

<p id="id10992">"No, sir, neither of those; something connected with this story."</p>

<p id="id10993">"Really? What is it?"</p>

<p id="id10994">"Listen," said the guide; "I said to myself, 'Something is always left
in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years,' so I began to
sound the wall."</p>

<p id="id10995">"Ah," cried Monte Cristo, remembering the abbe's two hiding-places.</p>

<p id="id10996">"After some search, I found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the
head of the bed, and at the hearth."</p>

<p id="id10997">"Yes," said the count, "yes."</p>

<p id="id10998">"I raised the stones, and found"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10999">"A rope-ladder and some tools?"</p>

<p id="id11000">"How do you know that?" asked the guide in astonishment.</p>

<p id="id11001">"I do not know&#8212;I only guess it, because that sort of thing is generally
found in prisoners' cells."</p>

<p id="id11002">"Yes, sir, a rope-ladder and tools."</p>

<p id="id11003">"And have you them yet?"</p>

<p id="id11004">"No, sir; I sold them to visitors, who considered them great
curiosities; but I have still something left."</p>

<p id="id11005">"What is it?" asked the count, impatiently.</p>

<p id="id11006">"A sort of book, written upon strips of cloth."</p>

<p id="id11007">"Go and fetch it, my good fellow; and if it be what I hope, you will do
well."</p>

<p id="id11008">"I will run for it, sir;" and the guide went out. Then the count knelt
down by the side of the bed, which death had converted into an altar.
"Oh, second father," he exclaimed, "thou who hast given me liberty,
knowledge, riches; thou who, like beings of a superior order to
ourselves, couldst understand the science of good and evil; if in the
depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can
respond to the voice of those who are left on earth; if after death the
soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered,&#8212;then,
noble heart, sublime soul, then I conjure thee by the paternal love thou
didst bear me, by the filial obedience I vowed to thee, grant me some
sign, some revelation! Remove from me the remains of doubt, which, if
it change not to conviction, must become remorse!" The count bowed his
head, and clasped his hands together.</p>

<p id="id11009">"Here, sir," said a voice behind him.</p>

<p id="id11010">Monte Cristo shuddered, and arose. The concierge held out the strips of
cloth upon which the Abbe Faria had spread the riches of his mind. The
manuscript was the great work by the Abbe Faria upon the kingdoms of
Italy. The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the
epigraph, and he read, "'Thou shalt tear out the dragons' teeth, and
shall trample the lions under foot, saith the Lord.'"</p>

<p id="id11011">"Ah," he exclaimed, "here is my answer. Thanks, father, thanks."
And feeling in his pocket, he took thence a small pocket-book, which
contained ten bank-notes, each of 1,000. francs.</p>

<p id="id11012">"Here," he said, "take this pocket-book."</p>

<p id="id11013">"Do you give it to me?"</p>

<p id="id11014">"Yes; but only on condition that you will not open it till I am gone;"
and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found, which was more
valuable to him than the richest jewel, he rushed out of the corridor,
and reaching his boat, cried, "To Marseilles!" Then, as he departed, he
fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison. "Woe," he cried, "to those who
confined me in that wretched prison; and woe to those who forgot that
I was there!" As he repassed the Catalans, the count turned around and
burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman. The victory
was complete; twice he had overcome his doubts. The name he pronounced,
in a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love, was that of Haidee.</p>

<p id="id11015">On landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure of
finding Morrel. He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a tomb,
and sought it vainly. He, who returned to France with millions, had been
unable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from hunger.
Morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot, but it had fallen down
and the grave-digger had burnt it, as he did all the old wood in the
churchyard. The worthy merchant had been more fortunate. Dying in the
arms of his children, he had been by them laid by the side of his
wife, who had preceded him in eternity by two years. Two large slabs of
marble, on which were inscribed their names, were placed on either side
of a little enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees.
Morrel was leaning against one of these, mechanically fixing his eyes
on the graves. His grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious.
"Maximilian," said the count, "you should not look on the graves, but
there;" and he pointed upwards.</p>

<p id="id11016">"The dead are everywhere," said Morrel; "did you not yourself tell me so
as we left Paris?"</p>

<p id="id11017">"Maximilian," said the count, "you asked me during the journey to allow
you to remain some days at Marseilles. Do you still wish to do so?"</p>

<p id="id11018">"I have no wishes, count; only I fancy I could pass the time less
painfully here than anywhere else."</p>

<p id="id11019">"So much the better, for I must leave you; but I carry your word with
me, do I not?"</p>

<p id="id11020">"Ah, count, I shall forget it."</p>

<p id="id11021">"No, you will not forget it, because you are a man of honor, Morrel,
because you have taken an oath, and are about to do so again."</p>

<p id="id11022">"Oh, count, have pity upon me. I am so unhappy."</p>

<p id="id11023">"I have known a man much more unfortunate than you, Morrel."</p>

<p id="id11024">"Impossible!"</p>

<p id="id11025">"Alas," said Monte Cristo, "it is the infirmity of our nature always to
believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides!"</p>

<p id="id11026">"What can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and
desired in the world?"</p>

<p id="id11027">"Listen, Morrel, and pay attention to what I am about to tell you. I
knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a
woman. He was young, he had an old father whom he loved, a betrothed
bride whom he adored. He was about to marry her, when one of the
caprices of fate,&#8212;which would almost make us doubt the goodness of
providence, if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by
proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end,&#8212;one of those
caprices deprived him of his mistress, of the future of which he had
dreamed (for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present),
and cast him into a dungeon."</p>

<p id="id11028">"Ah," said Morrel, "one quits a dungeon in a week, a month, or a year."</p>

<p id="id11029">"He remained there fourteen years, Morrel," said the count, placing his
hand on the young man's shoulder. Maximilian shuddered.</p>

<p id="id11030">"Fourteen years!" he muttered&#8212;"Fourteen years!" repeated the count.
"During that time he had many moments of despair. He also, Morrel, like
you, considered himself the unhappiest of men."</p>

<p id="id11031">"Well?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id11032">"Well, at the height of his despair God assisted him through human
means. At first, perhaps, he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the
Lord, but at last he took patience and waited. One day he miraculously
left the prison, transformed, rich, powerful. His first cry was for his
father; but that father was dead."</p>

<p id="id11033">"My father, too, is dead," said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id11034">"Yes; but your father died in your arms, happy, respected, rich, and
full of years; his father died poor, despairing, almost doubtful of
providence; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards, his
tomb had disappeared, and no one could say, 'There sleeps the father you
so well loved.'"</p>

<p id="id11035">"Oh!" exclaimed Morrel.</p>

<p id="id11036">"He was, then, a more unhappy son than you, Morrel, for he could not
even find his father's grave."</p>

<p id="id11037">"But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?"</p>

<p id="id11038">"You are deceived, Morrel, that woman"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11039">"She was dead?"</p>

<p id="id11040">"Worse than that, she was faithless, and had married one of the
persecutors of her betrothed. You see, then, Morrel, that he was a more
unhappy lover than you."</p>

<p id="id11041">"And has he found consolation?"</p>

<p id="id11042">"He has at least found peace."</p>

<p id="id11043">"And does he ever expect to be happy?"</p>

<p id="id11044">"He hopes so, Maximilian." The young man's head fell on his breast.</p>

<p id="id11045">"You have my promise," he said, after a minute's pause, extending his
hand to Monte Cristo. "Only remember"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11046">"On the 5th of October, Morrel, I shall expect you at the Island of<br>

Monte Cristo. On the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of<br>

Bastia, it will be called the Eurus. You will give your name to the<br>

captain, who will bring you to me. It is understood&#8212;is it not?"<br></p>

<p id="id11047">"But, count, do you remember that the 5th of October"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11048">"Child," replied the count, "not to know the value of a man's word! I
have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day, I will
assist you. Morrel, farewell!"</p>

<p id="id11049">"Do you leave me?"</p>

<p id="id11050">"Yes; I have business in Italy. I leave you alone with your misfortunes,
and with hope, Maximilian."</p>

<p id="id11051">"When do you leave?"</p>

<p id="id11052">"Immediately; the steamer waits, and in an hour I shall be far from you.<br>

Will you accompany me to the harbor, Maximilian?"<br></p>

<p id="id11053">"I am entirely yours, count." Morrel accompanied the count to the
harbor. The white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the
black chimney. The steamer soon disappeared, and in an hour afterwards,
as the count had said, was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon
amidst the fogs of the night.</p>

<h3 id="id11054" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 114. Peppino.</h3>

<p id="id11055">At the same time that the steamer disappeared behind Cape Morgion, a man
travelling post on the road from Florence to Rome had just passed the
little town of Aquapendente. He was travelling fast enough to cover a
great deal of ground without exciting suspicion. This man was dressed
in a greatcoat, or rather a surtout, a little worse for the journey,
but which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and
brilliant, a decoration which also ornamented the under coat. He might
be recognized, not only by these signs, but also from the accent with
which he spoke to the postilion, as a Frenchman. Another proof that he
was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his
knowing no other Italian words than the terms used in music, and
which like the "goddam" of Figaro, served all possible linguistic
requirements. "Allegro!" he called out to the postilions at every
ascent. "Moderato!" he cried as they descended. And heaven knows there
are hills enough between Rome and Florence by the way of Aquapendente!
These two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed. On
reaching La Storta, the point from whence Rome is first visible, the
traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads
strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of
St. Peter's, which may be seen long before any other object is
distinguishable. No, he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket, and
took from it a paper folded in four, and after having examined it in a
manner almost reverential, he said&#8212;"Good! I have it still!"</p>

<p id="id11056">The carriage entered by the Porto del Popolo, turned to the left, and
stopped at the Hotel d'Espagne. Old Pastrini, our former acquaintance,
received the traveller at the door, hat in hand. The traveller alighted,
ordered a good dinner, and inquired the address of the house of Thomson
&amp; French, which was immediately given to him, as it was one of the most
celebrated in Rome. It was situated in the Via dei Banchi, near St.
Peter's. In Rome, as everywhere else, the arrival of a post-chaise is an
event. Ten young descendants of Marius and the Gracchi, barefooted and
out at elbows, with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully
curved above the head, stared at the traveller, the post-chaise, and the
horses; to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the Papal
States, who earned a pittance by diving into the Tiber at high water
from the bridge of St. Angelo. Now, as these street Arabs of Rome,
more fortunate than those of Paris, understand every language, more
especially the French, they heard the traveller order an apartment, a
dinner, and finally inquire the way to the house of Thomson &amp; French.
The result was that when the new-comer left the hotel with the cicerone,
a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers, and without having
been seen by the traveller, and appearing to excite no attention from
the guide, followed the stranger with as much skill as a Parisian police
agent would have used.</p>

<p id="id11057">The Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson &amp;
French that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed, but left
word for the carriage to overtake him on the road, or to wait for him
at the bankers' door. He reached it before the carriage arrived. The
Frenchman entered, leaving in the anteroom his guide, who immediately
entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers
who are always to be found in Rome at the doors of banking-houses,
churches, museums, or theatres. With the Frenchman, the man who had
followed him entered too; the Frenchman knocked at the inner door, and
entered the first room; his shadow did the same.</p>

<p id="id11058">"Messrs. Thomson &amp; French?" inquired the stranger.</p>

<p id="id11059">An attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first
desk. "Whom shall I announce?" said the attendant.</p>

<p id="id11060">"Baron Danglars."</p>

<p id="id11061">"Follow me," said the man. A door opened, through which the attendant
and the baron disappeared. The man who had followed Danglars sat down on
a bench. The clerk continued to write for the next five minutes; the man
preserved profound silence, and remained perfectly motionless. Then the
pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper; he raised his head, and
appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy,&#8212;"Ah, ha," he said, "here you
are, Peppino!"</p>

<p id="id11062">"Yes," was the laconic reply. "You have found out that there is
something worth having about this large gentleman?"</p>

<p id="id11063">"There is no great merit due to me, for we were informed of it."</p>

<p id="id11064">"You know his business here, then."</p>

<p id="id11065">"Pardieu, he has come to draw, but I don't know how much!"</p>

<p id="id11066">"You will know presently, my friend."</p>

<p id="id11067">"Very well, only do not give me false information as you did the other
day."</p>

<p id="id11068">"What do you mean?&#8212;of whom do you speak? Was it the Englishman who
carried off 3,000 crowns from here the other day?"</p>

<p id="id11069">"No; he really had 3,000 crowns, and we found them. I mean the Russian
prince, who you said had 30,000 livres, and we only found 22,000."</p>

<p id="id11070">"You must have searched badly."</p>

<p id="id11071">"Luigi Vampa himself searched."</p>

<p id="id11072">"Indeed? But you must let me make my observations, or the Frenchman will
transact his business without my knowing the sum." Peppino nodded, and
taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while
the clerk disappeared through the same door by which Danglars and the
attendant had gone out. At the expiration of ten minutes the clerk
returned with a beaming countenance. "Well?" asked Peppino of his
friend.</p>

<p id="id11073">"Joy, joy&#8212;the sum is large!"</p>

<p id="id11074">"Five or six millions, is it not?"</p>

<p id="id11075">"Yes, you know the amount."</p>

<p id="id11076">"On the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id11077">"Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?"</p>

<p id="id11078">"I told you we were informed beforehand."</p>

<p id="id11079">"Then why do you apply to me?"</p>

<p id="id11080">"That I may be sure I have the right man."</p>

<p id="id11081">"Yes, it is indeed he. Five millions&#8212;a pretty sum, eh, Peppino?"</p>

<p id="id11082">"Hush&#8212;here is our man!" The clerk seized his pen, and Peppino his
beads; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened.
Danglars looked radiant with joy; the banker accompanied him to the
door. Peppino followed Danglars.</p>

<p id="id11083">According to the arrangements, the carriage was waiting at the door. The
guide held the door open. Guides are useful people, who will turn their
hands to anything. Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of
twenty. The cicerone reclosed the door, and sprang up by the side of the
coachman. Peppino mounted the seat behind.</p>

<p id="id11084">"Will your excellency visit St. Peter's?" asked the cicerone.</p>

<p id="id11085">"I did not come to Rome to see," said Danglars aloud; then he added
softly, with an avaricious smile, "I came to touch!" and he rapped his
pocket-book, in which he had just placed a letter.</p>

<p id="id11086">"Then your excellency is going"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11087">"To the hotel."</p>

<p id="id11088">"Casa Pastrini!" said the cicerone to the coachman, and the carriage
drove rapidly on. Ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his
apartment, and Peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door
of the hotel, after having whispered something in the ear of one of the
descendants of Marius and the Gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning
of the chapter, who immediately ran down the road leading to the Capitol
at his fullest speed. Danglars was tired and sleepy; he therefore went
to bed, placing his pocketbook under his pillow. Peppino had a little
spare time, so he had a game of mora with the facchini, lost three
crowns, and then to console himself drank a bottle of Orvieto.</p>

<p id="id11089">The next morning Danglars awoke late, though he went to bed so early; he
had not slept well for five or six nights, even if he had slept at all.
He breakfasted heartily, and caring little, as he said, for the beauties
of the Eternal City, ordered post-horses at noon. But Danglars had not
reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the
posting-master. The horses only arrived at two o'clock, and the cicerone
did not bring the passport till three. All these preparations had
collected a number of idlers round the door of Signor Pastrini's; the
descendants of Marius and the Gracchi were also not wanting. The baron
walked triumphantly through the crowd, who for the sake of gain styled
him "your excellency." As Danglars had hitherto contented himself
with being called a baron, he felt rather flattered at the title of
excellency, and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars, who
were ready, for twelve more, to call him "your highness."</p>

<p id="id11090">"Which road?" asked the postilion in Italian. "The Ancona road," replied
the baron. Signor Pastrini interpreted the question and answer, and the
horses galloped off. Danglars intended travelling to Venice, where he
would receive one part of his fortune, and then proceeding to Vienna,
where he would find the rest, he meant to take up his residence in the
latter town, which he had been told was a city of pleasure.</p>

<p id="id11091">He had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began
to disappear. Danglars had not intended starting so late, or he would
have remained; he put his head out and asked the postilion how long
it would be before they reached the next town. "Non capisco" (do not
understand), was the reply. Danglars bent his head, which he meant to
imply, "Very well." The carriage again moved on. "I will stop at the
first posting-house," said Danglars to himself.</p>

<p id="id11092">He still felt the same self-satisfaction which he had experienced the
previous evening, and which had procured him so good a night's rest. He
was luxuriously stretched in a good English calash, with double springs;
he was drawn by four good horses, at full gallop; he knew the relay
to be at a distance of seven leagues. What subject of meditation could
present itself to the banker, so fortunately become bankrupt?</p>

<p id="id11093">Danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in Paris; another ten
minutes about his daughter travelling with Mademoiselle d'Armilly;
the same period was given to his creditors, and the manner in which
he intended spending their money; and then, having no subject left for
contemplation, he shut his eyes, and fell asleep. Now and then a jolt
more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes; then he felt
that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same
country, thickly strewn with broken aqueducts, which looked like granite
giants petrified while running a race. But the night was cold, dull, and
rainy, and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the
warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries
of a postilion whose only answer was "Non capisco."</p>

<p id="id11094">Danglars therefore continued to sleep, saying to himself that he would
be sure to awake at the posting-house. The carriage stopped. Danglars
fancied that they had reached the long-desired point; he opened his eyes
and looked through the window, expecting to find himself in the midst
of some town, or at least village; but he saw nothing except what
seemed like a ruin, where three or four men went and came like shadows.
Danglars waited a moment, expecting the postilion to come and demand
payment with the termination of his stage. He intended taking advantage
of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor; but the
horses were unharnessed, and others put in their places, without any
one claiming money from the traveller. Danglars, astonished, opened the
door; but a strong hand pushed him back, and the carriage rolled on. The
baron was completely roused. "Eh?" he said to the postilion, "eh, mio
caro?"</p>

<p id="id11095">This was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from
hearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalcanti. But mio caro
did not reply. Danglars then opened the window.</p>

<p id="id11096">"Come, my friend," he said, thrusting his hand through the opening,
"where are we going?"</p>

<p id="id11097">"Dentro la testa!" answered a solemn and imperious voice, accompanied by
a menacing gesture. Danglars thought dentro la testa meant, "Put in your
head!" He was making rapid progress in Italian. He obeyed, not without
some uneasiness, which, momentarily increasing, caused his mind, instead
of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey, to fill with
ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake, more especially
one in such a situation as Danglars. His eyes acquired that quality
which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see
distinctly, and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed. Before
we are alarmed, we see correctly; when we are alarmed, we see double;
and when we have been alarmed, we see nothing but trouble. Danglars
observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage.</p>

<p id="id11098">"Some gendarme!" he exclaimed. "Can I have been intercepted by French
telegrams to the pontifical authorities?" He resolved to end his
anxiety. "Where are you taking me?" he asked. "Dentro la testa," replied
the same voice, with the same menacing accent.</p>

<p id="id11099">Danglars turned to the left; another man on horseback was galloping
on that side. "Decidedly," said Danglars, with the perspiration on his
forehead, "I must be under arrest." And he threw himself back in the
calash, not this time to sleep, but to think. Directly afterwards the
moon rose. He then saw the great aqueducts, those stone phantoms which
he had before remarked, only then they were on the right hand, now they
were on the left. He understood that they had described a circle, and
were bringing him back to Rome. "Oh, unfortunate!" he cried, "they
must have obtained my arrest." The carriage continued to roll on with
frightful speed. An hour of terror elapsed, for every spot they passed
showed that they were on the road back. At length he saw a dark mass,
against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash; but the
vehicle turned to one side, leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw
that it was one of the ramparts encircling Rome.</p>

<p id="id11100">"Mon dieu!" cried Danglars, "we are not returning to Rome; then it
is not justice which is pursuing me! Gracious heavens; another idea
presents itself&#8212;what if they should be"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11101">His hair stood on end. He remembered those interesting stories, so
little believed in Paris, respecting Roman bandits; he remembered the
adventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that
he should marry Mademoiselle Eugenie. "They are robbers, perhaps," he
muttered. Just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel
road. Danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road, and perceived
monuments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details
Morcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he
felt sure that he must be on the Appian Way. On the left, in a sort of
valley, he perceived a circular excavation. It was Caracalla's circus.
On a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage, it stopped.
At the same time the door was opened. "Scendi!" exclaimed a commanding
voice. Danglars instantly descended; although he did not yet speak
Italian, he understood it very well. More dead than alive, he looked
around him. Four men surrounded him, besides the postilion.</p>

<p id="id11102">"Di qua," said one of the men, descending a little path leading out of
the Appian Way. Danglars followed his guide without opposition, and
had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were
following him. Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal
distances from one another, like sentinels. After walking for about ten
minutes, during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his
guide, he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds;
three men, standing silent, formed a triangle, of which he was the
centre. He wished to speak, but his tongue refused to move. "Avanti!"
said the same sharp and imperative voice.</p>

<p id="id11103">This time Danglars had double reason to understand, for if the word
and gesture had not explained the speaker's meaning, it was clearly
expressed by the man walking behind him, who pushed him so rudely that
he struck against the guide. This guide was our friend Peppino, who
dashed into the thicket of high weeds, through a path which none but
lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road. Peppino
stopped before a pit overhung by thick hedges; the pit, half open,
afforded a passage to the young man, who disappeared like the evil
spirits in the fairy tales. The voice and gesture of the man who
followed Danglars ordered him to do the same. There was no longer
any doubt, the bankrupt was in the hands of Roman banditti. Danglars
acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions,
and who is rendered brave by fear. Notwithstanding his large stomach,
certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna, he
slid down like Peppino, and closing his eyes fell upon his feet. As he
touched the ground, he opened his eyes. The path was wide, but dark.
Peppino, who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his
own territories, struck a light and lit a torch. Two other men descended
after Danglars forming the rearguard, and pushing Danglars whenever he
happened to stop, they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of
two corridors. The walls were hollowed out in sepulchres, one above the
other, and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their
large dark eyes, like those which we see on the faces of the dead. A
sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand. "Who
comes there?" he cried.</p>

<p id="id11104">"A friend, a friend!" said Peppino; "but where is the captain?"</p>

<p id="id11105">"There," said the sentinel, pointing over his shoulder to a spacious
crypt, hollowed out of the rock, the lights from which shone into the
passage through the large arched openings. "Fine spoil, captain, fine
spoil!" said Peppino in Italian, and taking Danglars by the collar of
his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door, through which
they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his
dwelling-place.</p>

<p id="id11106">"Is this the man?" asked the captain, who was attentively reading<br>

Plutarch's "Life of Alexander."<br></p>

<p id="id11107">"Himself, captain&#8212;himself."</p>

<p id="id11108">"Very well, show him to me." At this rather impertinent order, Peppino
raised his torch to the face of Danglars, who hastily withdrew that he
might not have his eyelashes burnt. His agitated features presented
the appearance of pale and hideous terror. "The man is tired," said the
captain, "conduct him to his bed."</p>

<p id="id11109">"Oh," murmured Danglars, "that bed is probably one of the coffins
hollowed in the wall, and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from one
of the poniards I see glistening in the darkness."</p>

<p id="id11110">From their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the chamber
now arose the companions of the man who had been found by Albert de
Morcerf reading "Caesar's Commentaries," and by Danglars studying the
"Life of Alexander." The banker uttered a groan and followed his guide;
he neither supplicated nor exclaimed. He no longer possessed strength,
will, power, or feeling; he followed where they led him. At length he
found himself at the foot of a staircase, and he mechanically lifted
his foot five or six times. Then a low door was opened before him, and
bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room
cut out of the rock. The cell was clean, though empty, and dry, though
situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth. A bed of dried
grass covered with goat-skins was placed in one corner. Danglars
brightened up on beholding it, fancying that it gave some promise of
safety. "Oh, God be praised," he said; "it is a real bed!"</p>

<p id="id11111">"Ecco!" said the guide, and pushing Danglars into the cell, he closed
the door upon him. A bolt grated and Danglars was a prisoner. If there
had been no bolt, it would have been impossible for him to pass through
the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of St. Sebastian,
encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the
famous Luigi Vampa. Danglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose
existence he would not believe when Albert de Morcerf mentioned him in
Paris; and not only did he recognize him, but the cell in which Albert
had been confined, and which was probably kept for the accommodation
of strangers. These recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure
by Danglars, and restored him to some degree of tranquillity. Since the
bandits had not despatched him at once, he felt that they would not kill
him at all. They had arrested him for the purpose of robbery, and as he
had only a few louis about him, he doubted not he would be ransomed.
He remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4,000 crowns, and as he
considered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed
his own price at 8,000 crowns. Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48,000
livres; he would then have about 5,050,000 francs left. With this sum he
could manage to keep out of difficulties. Therefore, tolerably secure in
being able to extricate himself from his position, provided he were not
rated at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs, he stretched himself
on his bed, and after turning over two or three times, fell asleep with
the tranquillity of the hero whose life Luigi Vampa was studying.</p>

<h3 id="id11112" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa's Bill of Fare.</h3>

<p id="id11113">We awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars. He awoke.
To a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet
drapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white smoke of which
diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room, the appearance of
the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like
the continuation of some disagreeable dream. But in such a situation
a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty.
"Yes, yes," he murmured, "I am in the hands of the brigands of whom
Albert de Morcerf spoke." His first idea was to breathe, that he might
know whether he was wounded. He borrowed this from "Don Quixote," the
only book he had ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.</p>

<p id="id11114">"No," he cried, "they have not wounded, but perhaps they have robbed
me!" and he thrust his hands into his pockets. They were untouched; the
hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were
in his trousers pocket, and in that of his great-coat he found the
little note-case containing his letter of credit for 5,050,000 francs.
"Singular bandits!" he exclaimed; "they have left me my purse and
pocket-book. As I was saying last night, they intend me to be ransomed.
Hallo, here is my watch! Let me see what time it is." Danglars' watch,
one of Breguet's repeaters, which he had carefully wound up on the
previous night, struck half past five. Without this, Danglars would have
been quite ignorant of the time, for daylight did not reach his cell.
Should he demand an explanation from the bandits, or should he wait
patiently for them to propose it? The last alternative seemed the most
prudent, so he waited until twelve o'clock. During all this time a
sentinel, who had been relieved at eight o'clock, had been watching his
door. Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who
kept watch over him. He had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight,
but from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door;
he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful
of brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent
forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars. "Faugh!" he
exclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell.</p>

<p id="id11115">At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary, and Danglars,
wishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached the door again.
He was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large eyes, thick lips, and
a flat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around
his shoulders. "Ah, ha," cried Danglars, "this fellow is more like an
ogre than anything else; however, I am rather too old and tough to be
very good eating!" We see that Danglars was collected enough to jest; at
the same time, as though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man
took some black bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he
began devouring voraciously. "May I be hanged," said Danglars, glancing
at the bandit's dinner through the crevices of the door,&#8212;"may I be
hanged if I can understand how people can eat such filth!" and he
withdrew to seat himself upon his goat-skin, which reminded him of the
smell of the brandy.</p>

<p id="id11116">But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are certain
invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very
irresistibly to a fasting stomach. Danglars felt his own not to be very
well supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the
bread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful vulgar
onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes, which his
cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said, "Monsieur
Deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee to-day." He got up and
knocked on the door; the bandit raised his head. Danglars knew that
he was heard, so he redoubled his blows. "Che cosa?" asked the bandit.
"Come, come," said Danglars, tapping his fingers against the door, "I
think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat!" But
whether he did not understand him, or whether he had received no orders
respecting the nourishment of Danglars, the giant, without answering,
went on with his dinner. Danglars' feelings were hurt, and not wishing
to put himself under obligations to the brute, the banker threw himself
down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another word.</p>

<p id="id11117">Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit.
Danglars, who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach,
arose softly, again applied his eye to the crack of the door, and
recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide. It was, indeed,
Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by
seating himself opposite to the door, and placing between his legs an
earthen pan, containing chick-pease stewed with bacon. Near the pan he
also placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a flask
of Orvieto. Peppino was decidedly an epicure. Danglars watched these
preparations and his mouth watered. "Come," he said to himself, "let me
try if he will be more tractable than the other;" and he tapped gently
at the door. "On y va," (coming) exclaimed Peppino, who from frequenting
the house of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its
idioms.</p>

<p id="id11118">Danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in
such a furious manner, "Put in your head!" But this was not the time for
recrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a
gracious smile,&#8212;"Excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any
dinner?"</p>

<p id="id11119">"Does your excellency happen to be hungry?"</p>

<p id="id11120">"Happen to be hungry,&#8212;that's pretty good, when I haven't eaten for
twenty-four hours!" muttered Danglars. Then he added aloud, "Yes, sir, I
am hungry&#8212;very hungry."</p>

<p id="id11121">"What would your excellency like?" and Peppino placed his pan on the
ground, so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of Danglars.
"Give your orders."</p>

<p id="id11122">"Have you kitchens here?"</p>

<p id="id11123">"Kitchens?&#8212;of course&#8212;complete ones."</p>

<p id="id11124">"And cooks?"</p>

<p id="id11125">"Excellent!"</p>

<p id="id11126">"Well, a fowl, fish, game,&#8212;it signifies little, so that I eat."</p>

<p id="id11127">"As your excellency pleases. You mentioned a fowl, I think?"</p>

<p id="id11128">"Yes, a fowl." Peppino, turning around, shouted, "A fowl for his
excellency!" His voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome,
graceful, and half-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a silver
dish on his head, without the assistance of his hands. "I could almost
believe myself at the Cafe de Paris," murmured Danglars.</p>

<p id="id11129">"Here, your excellency," said Peppino, taking the fowl from the young
bandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table, which with the stool
and the goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell. Danglars
asked for a knife and fork. "Here, excellency," said Peppino, offering
him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork. Danglars took the knife in
one hand and the fork in the other, and was about to cut up the fowl.
"Pardon me, excellency," said Peppino, placing his hand on the banker's
shoulder; "people pay here before they eat. They might not be satisfied,
and"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11130">"Ah, ha," thought Danglars, "this is not so much like Paris, except that
I shall probably be skinned! Never mind, I'll fix that all right. I have
always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy; I should think a fowl is
worth about twelve sous at Rome.&#8212;There," he said, throwing a louis
down. Peppino picked up the louis, and Danglars again prepared to carve
the fowl. "Stay a moment, your excellency," said Peppino, rising; "you
still owe me something."</p>

<p id="id11131">"I said they would skin me," thought Danglars; but resolving to resist
the extortion, he said, "Come, how much do I owe you for this fowl?"</p>

<p id="id11132">"Your excellency has given me a louis on account."</p>

<p id="id11133">"A louis on account for a fowl?"</p>

<p id="id11134">"Certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis." Danglars
opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke. "Come, come,
this is very droll&#8212;very amusing&#8212;I allow; but, as I am very hungry,
pray allow me to eat. Stay, here is another louis for you."</p>

<p id="id11135">"Then that will make only 4,998 louis more," said Peppino with the same
indifference. "I shall get them all in time."</p>

<p id="id11136">"Oh, as for that," said Danglars, angry at this prolongation of the
jest,&#8212;"as for that you won't get them at all. Go to the devil! You do
not know with whom you have to deal!" Peppino made a sign, and the youth
hastily removed the fowl. Danglars threw himself upon his goat-skin,
and Peppino, reclosing the door, again began eating his pease and bacon.
Though Danglars could not see Peppino, the noise of his teeth allowed
no doubt as to his occupation. He was certainly eating, and noisily too,
like an ill-bred man. "Brute!" said Danglars. Peppino pretended not to
hear him, and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly.
Danglars' stomach felt so empty, that it seemed as if it would be
impossible ever to fill it again; still he had patience for another
half-hour, which appeared to him like a century. He again arose and went
to the door. "Come, sir, do not keep me starving here any longer, but
tell me what they want."</p>

<p id="id11137">"Nay, your excellency, it is you who should tell us what you want. Give
your orders, and we will execute them."</p>

<p id="id11138">"Then open the door directly." Peppino obeyed. "Now look here, I want
something to eat! To eat&#8212;do you hear?"</p>

<p id="id11139">"Are you hungry?"</p>

<p id="id11140">"Come, you understand me."</p>

<p id="id11141">"What would your excellency like to eat?"</p>

<p id="id11142">"A piece of dry bread, since the fowls are beyond all price in this
accursed place."</p>

<p id="id11143">"Bread? Very well. Hallo, there, some bread!" he called. The youth
brought a small loaf. "How much?" asked Danglars.</p>

<p id="id11144">"Four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis," said Peppino; "You
have paid two louis in advance."</p>

<p id="id11145">"What? One hundred thousand francs for a loaf?"</p>

<p id="id11146">"One hundred thousand francs," repeated Peppino.</p>

<p id="id11147">"But you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!"</p>

<p id="id11148">"We have a fixed price for all our provisions. It signifies nothing
whether you eat much or little&#8212;whether you have ten dishes or one&#8212;it
is always the same price."</p>

<p id="id11149">"What, still keeping up this silly jest? My dear fellow, it is perfectly
ridiculous&#8212;stupid! You had better tell me at once that you intend
starving me to death."</p>

<p id="id11150">"Oh, dear, no, your excellency, unless you intend to commit suicide. Pay
and eat."</p>

<p id="id11151">"And what am I to pay with, brute?" said Danglars, enraged. "Do you
suppose I carry 100,000 francs in my pocket?"</p>

<p id="id11152">"Your excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will be fifty
fowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the 50,000."</p>

<p id="id11153">Danglars shuddered. The bandage fell from his eyes, and he understood
the joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just
before. "Come," he said, "if I pay you the 100,000 francs, will you be
satisfied, and allow me to eat at my ease?"</p>

<p id="id11154">"Certainly," said Peppino.</p>

<p id="id11155">"But how can I pay them?"</p>

<p id="id11156">"Oh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs. Thomson &amp;
French, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these
gentlemen, and our banker shall take it." Danglars thought it as well
to comply with a good grace, so he took the pen, ink, and paper Peppino
offered him, wrote the draft, and signed it. "Here," he said, "here is a
draft at sight."</p>

<p id="id11157">"And here is your fowl." Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl;
it appeared very thin for the price it had cost. As for Peppino, he
examined the paper attentively, put it into his pocket, and continued
eating his pease.</p>

<h3 id="id11158" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 116. The Pardon.</h3>

<p id="id11159">The next day Danglars was again hungry; certainly the air of that
dungeon was very provocative of appetite. The prisoner expected that
he would be at no expense that day, for like an economical man he had
concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his
cell. But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty; he had forgotten
that. He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the
roof of his mouth; then, no longer able to resist, he called out. The
sentinel opened the door; it was a new face. He thought it would be
better to transact business with his old acquaintance, so he sent for
Peppino. "Here I am, your excellency," said Peppino, with an eagerness
which Danglars thought favorable to him. "What do you want?"</p>

<p id="id11160">"Something to drink."</p>

<p id="id11161">"Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near Rome."</p>

<p id="id11162">"Then give me water," cried Danglars, endeavoring to parry the blow.</p>

<p id="id11163">"Oh, water is even more scarce than wine, your excellency,&#8212;there has
been such a drought."</p>

<p id="id11164">"Come," thought Danglars, "it is the same old story." And while he
smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke, he felt his
temples get moist with perspiration.</p>

<p id="id11165">"Come, my friend," said Danglars, seeing that he made no impression on<br>

Peppino, "you will not refuse me a glass of wine?"<br></p>

<p id="id11166">"I have already told you that we do not sell at retail."</p>

<p id="id11167">"Well, then, let me have a bottle of the least expensive."</p>

<p id="id11168">"They are all the same price."</p>

<p id="id11169">"And what is that?"</p>

<p id="id11170">"Twenty-five thousand francs a bottle."</p>

<p id="id11171">"Tell me," cried Danglars, in a tone whose bitterness Harpagon [*] alone
has been capable of revealing&#8212;"tell me that you wish to despoil me of
all; it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal."</p>

<p id="id11172">     * The miser in Moliere's comedy of "L'Avare."&#8212;Ed.</p>

<p id="id11173">"It is possible such may be the master's intention."</p>

<p id="id11174">"The master?&#8212;who is he?"</p>

<p id="id11175">"The person to whom you were conducted yesterday."</p>

<p id="id11176">"Where is he?"</p>

<p id="id11177">"Here."</p>

<p id="id11178">"Let me see him."</p>

<p id="id11179">"Certainly." And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Danglars.</p>

<p id="id11180">"You sent for me?" he said to the prisoner.</p>

<p id="id11181">"Are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?"</p>

<p id="id11182">"Yes, your excellency. What then?"</p>

<p id="id11183">"How much do you require for my ransom?"</p>

<p id="id11184">"Merely the 5,000,000 you have about you." Danglars felt a dreadful
spasm dart through his heart. "But this is all I have left in the
world," he said, "out of an immense fortune. If you deprive me of that,
take away my life also."</p>

<p id="id11185">"We are forbidden to shed your blood."</p>

<p id="id11186">"And by whom are you forbidden?"</p>

<p id="id11187">"By him we obey."</p>

<p id="id11188">"You do, then, obey some one?"</p>

<p id="id11189">"Yes, a chief."</p>

<p id="id11190">"I thought you said you were the chief?"</p>

<p id="id11191">"So I am of these men; but there is another over me."</p>

<p id="id11192">"And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?"</p>

<p id="id11193">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id11194">"But my purse will be exhausted."</p>

<p id="id11195">"Probably."</p>

<p id="id11196">"Come," said Danglars, "will you take a million?"</p>

<p id="id11197">"No."</p>

<p id="id11198">"Two millions?&#8212;three?&#8212;four? Come, four? I will give them to you on
condition that you let me go."</p>

<p id="id11199">"Why do you offer me 4,000,000 for what is worth 5,000,000? This is a
kind of usury, banker, that I do not understand."</p>

<p id="id11200">"Take all, then&#8212;take all, I tell you, and kill me!"</p>

<p id="id11201">"Come, come, calm yourself. You will excite your blood, and that would
produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy. Be more
economical."</p>

<p id="id11202">"But when I have no more money left to pay you?" asked the infuriated<br>

Danglars.<br></p>

<p id="id11203">"Then you must suffer hunger."</p>

<p id="id11204">"Suffer hunger?" said Danglars, becoming pale.</p>

<p id="id11205">"Most likely," replied Vampa coolly.</p>

<p id="id11206">"But you say you do not wish to kill me?"</p>

<p id="id11207">"No."</p>

<p id="id11208">"And yet you will let me perish with hunger?"</p>

<p id="id11209">"Ah, that is a different thing."</p>

<p id="id11210">"Well, then, wretches," cried Danglars, "I will defy your infamous
calculations&#8212;I would rather die at once! You may torture, torment, kill
me, but you shall not have my signature again!"</p>

<p id="id11211">"As your excellency pleases," said Vampa, as he left the cell. Danglars,
raving, threw himself on the goat-skin. Who could these men be? Who was
the invisible chief? What could be his intentions towards him? And why,
when every one else was allowed to be ransomed, might he not also be?
Oh, yes; certainly a speedy, violent death would be a fine means of
deceiving these remorseless enemies, who appeared to pursue him with
such incomprehensible vengeance. But to die? For the first time in his
life, Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire;
the time had come when the implacable spectre, which exists in the mind
of every human creature, arrested his attention and called out with
every pulsation of his heart, "Thou shalt die!"</p>

<p id="id11212">Danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase; first it flies,
then despairs, and at last, by the very force of desperation, sometimes
succeeds in eluding its pursuers. Danglars meditated an escape; but the
walls were solid rock, a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to
the cell, and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed.
His resolution not to sign lasted two days, after which he offered a
million for some food. They sent him a magnificent supper, and took his
million.</p>

<p id="id11213">From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer, but to have
everything he wanted. At the end of twelve days, after having made a
splendid dinner, he reckoned his accounts, and found that he had only
50,000 francs left. Then a strange reaction took place; he who had just
abandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left,
and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of
privation&#8212;he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of
madness. He who for so long a time had forgotten God, began to
think that miracles were possible&#8212;that the accursed cavern might be
discovered by the officers of the Papal States, who would release him;
that then he would have 50,000 remaining, which would be sufficient to
save him from starvation; and finally he prayed that this sum might
be preserved to him, and as he prayed he wept. Three days passed thus,
during which his prayers were frequent, if not heartfelt. Sometimes he
was delirious, and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet; he,
also, was dying of hunger.</p>

<p id="id11214">On the fourth, he was no longer a man, but a living corpse. He had
picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals, and was
beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell. Then
he entreated Peppino, as he would a guardian angel, to give him food;
he offered him 1,000 francs for a mouthful of bread. But Peppino did not
answer. On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell.</p>

<p id="id11215">"Are you not a Christian?" he said, falling on his knees. "Do you wish
to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of heaven, is a brother? Oh, my
former friends, my former friends!" he murmured, and fell with his face
to the ground. Then rising in despair, he exclaimed, "The chief, the
chief!"</p>

<p id="id11216">"Here I am," said Vampa, instantly appearing; "what do you want?"</p>

<p id="id11217">"Take my last gold," muttered Danglars, holding out his pocket-book,
"and let me live here; I ask no more for liberty&#8212;I only ask to live!"</p>

<p id="id11218">"Then you suffer a great deal?"</p>

<p id="id11219">"Oh, yes, yes, cruelly!"</p>

<p id="id11220">"Still, there have been men who suffered more than you."</p>

<p id="id11221">"I do not think so."</p>

<p id="id11222">"Yes; those who have died of hunger."</p>

<p id="id11223">Danglars thought of the old man whom, in his hours of delirium, he
had seen groaning on his bed. He struck his forehead on the ground and
groaned. "Yes," he said, "there have been some who have suffered more
than I have, but then they must have been martyrs at least."</p>

<p id="id11224">"Do you repent?" asked a deep, solemn voice, which caused Danglars' hair
to stand on end. His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects, and
behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak, half lost in the
shadow of a stone column.</p>

<p id="id11225">"Of what must I repent?" stammered Danglars.</p>

<p id="id11226">"Of the evil you have done," said the voice.</p>

<p id="id11227">"Oh, yes; oh, yes, I do indeed repent." And he struck his breast with
his emaciated fist.</p>

<p id="id11228">"Then I forgive you," said the man, dropping his cloak, and advancing to
the light.</p>

<p id="id11229">"The Count of Monte Cristo!" said Danglars, more pale from terror than
he had been just before from hunger and misery.</p>

<p id="id11230">"You are mistaken&#8212;I am not the Count of Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id11231">"Then who are you?"</p>

<p id="id11232">"I am he whom you sold and dishonored&#8212;I am he whose betrothed you
prostituted&#8212;I am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise
yourself to fortune&#8212;I am he whose father you condemned to die of
hunger&#8212;I am he whom you also condemned to starvation, and who yet
forgives you, because he hopes to be forgiven&#8212;I am Edmond Dantes!"
Danglars uttered a cry, and fell prostrate. "Rise," said the count,
"your life is safe; the same good fortune has not happened to your
accomplices&#8212;one is mad, the other dead. Keep the 50,000 francs you have
left&#8212;I give them to you. The 5,000,000 you stole from the hospitals has
been restored to them by an unknown hand. And now eat and drink; I will
entertain you to-night. Vampa, when this man is satisfied, let him be
free." Danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew; when he
raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but
a shadow, before which the bandits bowed. According to the count's
directions, Danglars was waited on by Vampa, who brought him the best
wine and fruits of Italy; then, having conducted him to the road, and
pointed to the post-chaise, left him leaning against a tree. He remained
there all night, not knowing where he was. When daylight dawned he saw
that he was near a stream; he was thirsty, and dragged himself towards
it. As he stooped down to drink, he saw that his hair had become
entirely white.</p>

<h3 id="id11233" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 117. The Fifth of October.</h3>

<p id="id11234">It was about six o'clock in the evening; an opal-colored light, through
which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays, descended on the blue ocean.
The heat of the day had gradually decreased, and a light breeze arose,
seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning
siesta of the south. A delicious zephyr played along the coasts of
the Mediterranean, and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of
plants, mingled with the fresh smell of the sea.</p>

<p id="id11235">A light yacht, chaste and elegant in its form, was gliding amidst the
first dews of night over the immense lake, extending from Gibraltar to
the Dardanelles, and from Tunis to Venice. The vessel resembled a
swan with its wings opened towards the wind, gliding on the water. It
advanced swiftly and gracefully, leaving behind it a glittering stretch
of foam. By degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon; but
as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology,
its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave, as if the
god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of Amphitrite, who in vain
endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle. The yacht moved
rapidly on, though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle
the curls on the head of a young girl. Standing on the prow was a tall
man, of a dark complexion, who saw with dilating eyes that they were
approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone, which rose
from the midst of the waves like the hat of a Catalan. "Is that Monte
Cristo?" asked the traveller, to whose orders the yacht was for the time
submitted, in a melancholy voice.</p>

<p id="id11236">"Yes, your excellency," said the captain, "we have reached it."</p>

<p id="id11237">"We have reached it!" repeated the traveller in an accent of
indescribable sadness. Then he added, in a low tone, "Yes; that is the
haven." And then he again plunged into a train of thought, the character
of which was better revealed by a sad smile, than it would have been by
tears. A few minutes afterwards a flash of light, which was extinguished
instantly, was seen on the land, and the sound of firearms reached the
yacht.</p>

<p id="id11238">"Your excellency," said the captain, "that was the land signal, will you
answer yourself?"</p>

<p id="id11239">"What signal?" The captain pointed towards the island, up the side of
which ascended a volume of smoke, increasing as it rose. "Ah, yes," he
said, as if awaking from a dream. "Give it to me."</p>

<p id="id11240">The captain gave him a loaded carbine; the traveller slowly raised it,
and fired in the air. Ten minutes afterwards, the sails were furled, and
they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor. The
gig was already lowered, and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain.
The traveller descended, and instead of sitting down at the stern of the
boat, which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation,
stood up with his arms crossed. The rowers waited, their oars half
lifted out of the water, like birds drying their wings.</p>

<p id="id11241">"Give way," said the traveller. The eight oars fell into the sea
simultaneously without splashing a drop of water, and the boat, yielding
to the impulsion, glided forward. In an instant they found themselves
in a little harbor, formed in a natural creek; the boat grounded on the
fine sand.</p>

<p id="id11242">"Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our
men, they will carry you ashore?" The young man answered this invitation
with a gesture of indifference, and stepped out of the boat; the sea
immediately rose to his waist. "Ah, your excellency," murmured the
pilot, "you should not have done so; our master will scold us for it."
The young man continued to advance, following the sailors, who chose
a firm footing. Thirty strides brought them to dry land; the young man
stamped on the ground to shake off the wet, and looked around for some
one to show him his road, for it was quite dark. Just as he turned,
a hand rested on his shoulder, and a voice which made him shudder
exclaimed,&#8212;"Good-evening, Maximilian; you are punctual, thank you!"</p>

<p id="id11243">"Ah, is it you, count?" said the young man, in an almost joyful accent,
pressing Monte Cristo's hand with both his own.</p>

<p id="id11244">"Yes; you see I am as exact as you are. But you are dripping, my dear
fellow; you must change your clothes, as Calypso said to Telemachus.
Come, I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget
fatigue and cold." Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned
around; indeed, Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought
him had left without being paid, or uttering a word. Already the sound
of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht.</p>

<p id="id11245">"Oh, yes," said the count, "you are looking for the sailors."</p>

<p id="id11246">"Yes, I paid them nothing, and yet they are gone."</p>

<p id="id11247">"Never mind that, Maximilian," said Monte Cristo, smiling. "I have made
an agreement with the navy, that the access to my island shall be free
of all charge. I have made a bargain." Morrel looked at the count with
surprise. "Count," he said, "you are not the same here as in Paris."</p>

<p id="id11248">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id11249">"Here you laugh." The count's brow became clouded. "You are right to
recall me to myself, Maximilian," he said; "I was delighted to see you
again, and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting."</p>

<p id="id11250">"Oh, no, no, count," cried Maximilian, seizing the count's hands, "pray
laugh; be happy, and prove to me, by your indifference, that life is
endurable to sufferers. Oh, how charitable, kind, and good you are; you
affect this gayety to inspire me with courage."</p>

<p id="id11251">"You are wrong, Morrel; I was really happy."</p>

<p id="id11252">"Then you forget me, so much the better."</p>

<p id="id11253">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id11254">"Yes; for as the gladiator said to the emperor, when he entered the
arena, 'He who is about to die salutes you.'"</p>

<p id="id11255">"Then you are not consoled?" asked the count, surprised.</p>

<p id="id11256">"Oh," exclaimed Morrel, with a glance full of bitter reproach, "do you
think it possible that I could be?"</p>

<p id="id11257">"Listen," said the count. "Do you understand the meaning of my words?
You cannot take me for a commonplace man, a mere rattle, emitting a
vague and senseless noise. When I ask you if you are consoled, I speak
to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets. Well, Morrel,
let us both examine the depths of your heart. Do you still feel the same
feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion?
Have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the
grave? Are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to
the pursuit of death; or are you only suffering from the prostration
of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred? Has the loss of memory
rendered it impossible for you to weep? Oh, my dear friend, if this be
the case,&#8212;if you can no longer weep, if your frozen heart be dead, if
you put all your trust in God, then, Maximilian, you are consoled&#8212;do
not complain."</p>
