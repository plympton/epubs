<p id="id10169">"Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done," said Villefort. "My
father has revealed the culprit's name; my father thirsts for revenge as
much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this secret. Do
you not, father?"</p>

<p id="id10170">"Yes," resolutely replied Noirtier. Morrel suffered an exclamation of
horror and surprise to escape him. "Oh, sir," said Villefort, arresting
Maximilian by the arm, "if my father, the inflexible man, makes this
request, it is because he knows, be assured, that Valentine will be
terribly revenged. Is it not so, father?" The old man made a sign in the
affirmative. Villefort continued: "He knows me, and I have pledged my
word to him. Rest assured, gentlemen, that within three days, in a less
time than justice would demand, the revenge I shall have taken for the
murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble;"
and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth, and grasped the old
man's senseless hand.</p>

<p id="id10171">"Will this promise be fulfilled, M. Noirtier?" asked Morrel, while
d'Avrigny looked inquiringly.</p>

<p id="id10172">"Yes," replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.</p>

<p id="id10173">"Swear, then," said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and
d'Avrigny, "swear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave
me to avenge my child." D'Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble
"Yes," but Morrel, disengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after
having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own, hurriedly left,
uttering a long, deep groan of despair and anguish. We have before
stated that all the servants had fled. M. de Villefort was therefore
obliged to request M. d'Avrigny to superintend all the arrangements
consequent upon a death in a large city, more especially a death under
such suspicious circumstances.</p>

<p id="id10174">It was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair
of Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks. Villefort
retired to his study, and d'Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the
mayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who
is expressly named "the doctor of the dead." M. Noirtier could not be
persuaded to quit his grandchild. At the end of a quarter of an hour M.
d'Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate closed,
and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was obliged
to open to them. But he stopped on the landing; he had not the courage
to again visit the death chamber. The two doctors, therefore, entered
the room alone. Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent
as the corpse. The district doctor approached with the indifference of
a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead; he then lifted
the sheet which was placed over the face, and just unclosed the lips.</p>

<p id="id10175">"Alas," said d'Avrigny, "she is indeed dead, poor child!"</p>

<p id="id10176">"Yes," answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had
raised. Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old man's
eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold
his child. He therefore approached the bed, and while his companion was
dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in
chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face, which looked like
that of a sleeping angel. A tear, which appeared in the old man's eye,
expressed his thanks to the doctor. The doctor of the dead then laid his
permit on the corner of the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was
conducted out by d'Avrigny. Villefort met them at the door of his
study; having in a few words thanked the district doctor, he turned to
d'Avrigny, and said,&#8212;"And now the priest."</p>

<p id="id10177">"Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?" asked
d'Avrigny.</p>

<p id="id10178">"No." said Villefort; "fetch the nearest."</p>

<p id="id10179">"The nearest," said the district doctor, "is a good Italian abbe, who
lives next door to you. Shall I call on him as I pass?"</p>

<p id="id10180">"D'Avrigny," said Villefort, "be so kind, I beseech you, as to accompany
this gentleman. Here is the key of the door, so that you can go in and
out as you please; you will bring the priest with you, and will oblige
me by introducing him into my child's room."</p>

<p id="id10181">"Do you wish to see him?"</p>

<p id="id10182">"I only wish to be alone. You will excuse me, will you not? A priest
can understand a father's grief." And M. de Villefort, giving the key to
d'Avrigny, again bade farewell to the strange doctor, and retired to his
study, where he began to work. For some temperaments work is a remedy
for all afflictions. As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man
in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door. "This is the
abbe of whom I spoke," said the doctor to d'Avrigny. D'Avrigny accosted
the priest. "Sir," he said, "are you disposed to confer a great
obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter? I mean
M. de Villefort, the king's attorney."</p>

<p id="id10183">"Ah," said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; "yes, I have heard
that death is in that house."</p>

<p id="id10184">"Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you."</p>

<p id="id10185">"I was about to offer myself, sir," said the priest; "it is our mission
to forestall our duties."</p>

<p id="id10186">"It is a young girl."</p>

<p id="id10187">"I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me. I
also know that her name is Valentine, and I have already prayed for
her."</p>

<p id="id10188">"Thank you, sir," said d'Avrigny; "since you have commenced your sacred
office, deign to continue it. Come and watch by the dead, and all the
wretched family will be grateful to you."</p>

<p id="id10189">"I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be
more fervent than mine." D'Avrigny took the priest's hand, and
without meeting Villefort, who was engaged in his study, they reached
Valentine's room, which on the following night was to be occupied by
the undertakers. On entering the room, Noirtier's eyes met those of the
abbe, and no doubt he read some particular expression in them, for he
remained in the room. D'Avrigny recommended the attention of the priest
to the living as well as to the dead, and the abbe promised to devote
his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirtier. In order,
doubtless, that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred
mission, the priest rose as soon as d'Avrigny departed, and not only
bolted the door through which the doctor had just left, but also that
leading to Madame de Villefort's room.</p>

<h3 id="id10190" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 104. Danglars Signature.</h3>

<p id="id10191">The next morning dawned dull and cloudy. During the night the
undertakers had executed their melancholy office, and wrapped the corpse
in the winding-sheet, which, whatever may be said about the equality of
death, is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life. This
winding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric, which
the young girl had bought a fortnight before. During the evening two
men, engaged for the purpose, had carried Noirtier from Valentine's room
into his own, and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty
in withdrawing him from his child. The Abbe Busoni had watched till
daylight, and then left without calling any one. D'Avrigny returned
about eight o'clock in the morning; he met Villefort on his way to
Noirtier's room, and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept.
They found him in the large arm-chair, which served him for a bed,
enjoying a calm, nay, almost a smiling sleep. They both stood in
amazement at the door.</p>

<p id="id10192">"See," said d'Avrigny to Villefort, "nature knows how to alleviate the
deepest sorrow. No one can say that M. Noirtier did not love his child,
and yet he sleeps."</p>

<p id="id10193">"Yes, you are right," replied Villefort, surprised; "he sleeps, indeed!
And this is the more strange, since the least contradiction keeps him
awake all night."</p>

<p id="id10194">"Grief has stunned him," replied d'Avrigny; and they both returned
thoughtfully to the procureur's study.</p>

<p id="id10195">"See, I have not slept," said Villefort, showing his undisturbed bed;
"grief does not stun me. I have not been in bed for two nights; but
then look at my desk; see what I have written during these two days and
nights. I have filled those papers, and have made out the accusation
against the assassin Benedetto. Oh, work, work,&#8212;my passion, my joy, my
delight,&#8212;it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!" and he convulsively
grasped the hand of d'Avrigny.</p>

<p id="id10196">"Do you require my services now?" asked d'Avrigny.</p>

<p id="id10197">"No," said Villefort; "only return again at eleven o'clock; at twelve
the&#8212;the&#8212;oh, heavens, my poor, poor child!" and the procureur again
becoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.</p>

<p id="id10198">"Shall you be present in the reception room?"</p>

<p id="id10199">"No; I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office. I shall work,
doctor&#8212;when I work I forget everything." And, indeed, no sooner had
the doctor left the room, than he was again absorbed in study. On the
doorsteps d'Avrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had mentioned, a
personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied&#8212;one
of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to
others. He was punctual, dressed in black, with crape around his hat,
and presented himself at his cousin's with a face made up for the
occasion, and which he could alter as might be required. At twelve
o'clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court, and the Rue du
Faubourg Saint-Honore was filled with a crowd of idlers, equally pleased
to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich, and who rush
with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a
duchess.</p>

<p id="id10200">Gradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends
made their appearance&#8212;we mean Debray, Chateau-Renaud, and Beauchamp,
accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in literature,
or the army, for M. de Villefort moved in the first Parisian circles,
less owing to his social position than to his personal merit. The cousin
standing at the door ushered in the guests, and it was rather a relief
to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves, and who did
not exact a mournful face or force tears, as would have been the case
with a father, a brother, or a lover. Those who were acquainted
soon formed into little groups. One of them was made of Debray,
Chateau-Renaud, and Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id10201">"Poor girl," said Debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary tribute
to the sad event,&#8212;"poor girl, so young, so rich, so beautiful! Could
you have imagined this scene, Chateau-Renaud, when we saw her, at the
most three weeks ago, about to sign that contract?"</p>

<p id="id10202">"Indeed, no," said Chateau-Renaud&#8212;"Did you know her?"</p>

<p id="id10203">"I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf's, among the rest;
she appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy. Where is her
stepmother? Do you know?"</p>

<p id="id10204">"She is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is
receiving us."</p>

<p id="id10205">"Who is he?"</p>

<p id="id10206">"Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id10207">"The gentleman who receives us? Is he a deputy?"</p>

<p id="id10208">"Oh, no. I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day," said<br>

Beauchamp; "but he is perfectly unknown to me."<br></p>

<p id="id10209">"Have you mentioned this death in your paper?"</p>

<p id="id10210">"It has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, I doubt if
it will please M. Villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths
had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king's attorney, he
would have interested himself somewhat more about it."</p>

<p id="id10211">"Still," said Chateau-Renaud, "Dr. d'Avrigny, who attends my mother,
declares he is in despair about it. But whom are you seeking, Debray?"</p>

<p id="id10212">"I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo" said the young man.</p>

<p id="id10213">"I met him on the boulevard, on my way here," said Beauchamp. "I think
he is about to leave Paris; he was going to his banker."</p>

<p id="id10214">"His banker? Danglars is his banker, is he not?" asked Chateau-Renaud of<br>

Debray.<br></p>

<p id="id10215">"I believe so," replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. "But Monte<br>

Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel."<br></p>

<p id="id10216">"Morrel? Do they know him?" asked Chateau-Renaud. "I think he has only
been introduced to Madame de Villefort."</p>

<p id="id10217">"Still, he ought to have been here," said Debray; "I wonder what will
be talked about to-night; this funeral is the news of the day. But hush,
here comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some
little speech to the cousin," and the three young men drew near to
listen. Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the
funeral he had met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the
Rue de la Chausse d'Antin, to M. Danglars'.</p>

<p id="id10218">The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the court yard, and
advanced to meet him with a sad, though affable smile. "Well," said
he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo, "I suppose you have come to
sympathize with me, for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my
house. When I perceived you, I was just asking myself whether I had not
wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs, which would have justified the
proverb of 'He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences
them himself.' Well, on my word of honor, I answered, 'No!' I wished
no ill to Morcerf; he was a little proud, perhaps, for a man who like
myself has risen from nothing; but we all have our faults. Do you know,
count, that persons of our time of life&#8212;not that you belong to the
class, you are still a young man,&#8212;but as I was saying, persons of our
time of life have been very unfortunate this year. For example, look at
the puritanical procureur, who has just lost his daughter, and in fact
nearly all his family, in so singular a manner; Morcerf dishonored
and dead; and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of
Benedetto; besides"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10219">"Besides what?" asked the Count.</p>

<p id="id10220">"Alas, do you not know?"</p>

<p id="id10221">"What new calamity?"</p>

<p id="id10222">"My daughter"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10223">"Mademoiselle Danglars?"</p>

<p id="id10224">"Eugenie has left us!"</p>

<p id="id10225">"Good heavens, what are you telling me?"</p>

<p id="id10226">"The truth, my dear count. Oh, how happy you must be in not having
either wife or children!"</p>

<p id="id10227">"Do you think so?"</p>

<p id="id10228">"Indeed I do."</p>

<p id="id10229">"And so Mademoiselle Danglars"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10230">"She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so she
asked permission to travel."</p>

<p id="id10231">"And is she gone?"</p>

<p id="id10232">"The other night she left."</p>

<p id="id10233">"With Madame Danglars?"</p>

<p id="id10234">"No, with a relation. But still, we have quite lost our dear Eugenie;
for I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to France."</p>

<p id="id10235">"Still, baron," said Monte Cristo, "family griefs, or indeed any other
affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure,
are endurable to a millionaire. Philosophers may well say, and practical
men will always support the opinion, that money mitigates many trials;
and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm, you ought to
be very easily consoled&#8212;you, the king of finance, the focus of
immeasurable power."</p>

<p id="id10236">Danglars looked at him askance, as though to ascertain whether he spoke
seriously. "Yes," he answered, "if a fortune brings consolation, I ought
to be consoled; I am rich."</p>

<p id="id10237">"So rich, dear sir, that your fortune resembles the pyramids; if you
wished to demolish them you could not, and if it were possible, you
would not dare!" Danglars smiled at the good-natured pleasantry of the
count. "That reminds me," he said, "that when you entered I was on the
point of signing five little bonds; I have already signed two: will you
allow me to do the same to the others?"</p>

<p id="id10238">"Pray do so."</p>

<p id="id10239">There was a moment's silence, during which the noise of the banker's pen
was alone heard, while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the
ceiling. "Are they Spanish, Haitian, or Neapolitan bonds?" said Monte
Cristo. "No," said Danglars, smiling, "they are bonds on the bank of
France, payable to bearer. Stay, count," he added, "you, who may be
called the emperor, if I claim the title of king of finance, have you
many pieces of paper of this size, each worth a million?" The count took
into his hands the papers, which Danglars had so proudly presented to
him, and read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10240">"To the Governor of the Bank. Please pay to my order, from the fund
deposited by me, the sum of a million, and charge the same to my
account.</p>

<p id="id10241">"Baron Danglars."</p>

<p id="id10242">"One, two, three, four, five," said Monte Cristo; "five millions&#8212;why
what a Croesus you are!"</p>

<p id="id10243">"This is how I transact business," said Danglars.</p>

<p id="id10244">"It is really wonderful," said the count; "above all, if, as I suppose,
it is payable at sight."</p>

<p id="id10245">"It is, indeed, said Danglars.</p>

<p id="id10246">"It is a fine thing to have such credit; really, it is only in France
these things are done. Five millions on five little scraps of paper!&#8212;it
must be seen to be believed."</p>

<p id="id10247">"You do not doubt it?"</p>

<p id="id10248">"No!"</p>

<p id="id10249">"You say so with an accent&#8212;stay, you shall be convinced; take my clerk
to the bank, and you will see him leave it with an order on the Treasury
for the same sum."</p>

<p id="id10250">"No," said Monte Cristo folding the five notes, "most decidedly not; the
thing is so curious, I will make the experiment myself. I am credited
on you for six millions. I have drawn nine hundred thousand francs, you
therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs. I
will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds, with your
signature alone, and here is a receipt in full for the six millions
between us. I had prepared it beforehand, for I am much in want of money
to-day." And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one
hand, while with the other he held out the receipt to Danglars. If
a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker's feet, he could not have
experienced greater terror.</p>

<p id="id10251">"What," he stammered, "do you mean to keep that money? Excuse me,
excuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,&#8212;a deposit which I
promised to pay this morning."</p>

<p id="id10252">"Oh, well, then," said Monte Cristo, "I am not particular about these
five notes, pay me in a different form; I wished, from curiosity, to
take these, that I might be able to say that without any advice or
preparation the house of Danglars had paid me five millions without a
minute's delay; it would have been remarkable. But here are your bonds;
pay me differently;" and he held the bonds towards Danglars, who seized
them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is
being wrested from its grasp. Suddenly he rallied, made a violent effort
to restrain himself, and then a smile gradually widened the features of
his disturbed countenance.</p>

<p id="id10253">"Certainly," he said, "your receipt is money."</p>

<p id="id10254">"Oh dear, yes; and if you were at Rome, the house of Thomson &amp; French
would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than
you have just done."</p>

<p id="id10255">"Pardon me, count, pardon me."</p>

<p id="id10256">"Then I may keep this money?"</p>

<p id="id10257">"Yes," said Danglars, while the perspiration started from the roots of
his hair. "Yes, keep it&#8212;keep it."</p>

<p id="id10258">Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable
expression which seemed to say, "Come, reflect; if you repent there is
still time."</p>

<p id="id10259">"No," said Danglars, "no, decidedly no; keep my signatures. But you know
none are so formal as bankers in transacting business; I intended this
money for the charity fund, and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not
pay them with these precise bonds. How absurd&#8212;as if one crown were
not as good as another. Excuse me;" and he began to laugh loudly, but
nervously.</p>

<p id="id10260">"Certainly, I excuse you," said Monte Cristo graciously, "and pocket
them." And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book.</p>

<p id="id10261">"But," said Danglars, "there is still a sum of one hundred thousand
francs?"</p>

<p id="id10262">"Oh, a mere nothing," said Monte Cristo. "The balance would come to
about that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits."</p>

<p id="id10263">"Count," said Danglars, "are you speaking seriously?"</p>

<p id="id10264">"I never joke with bankers," said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner,
which repelled impertinence; and he turned to the door, just as the
valet de chambre announced,&#8212;"M. de Boville, receiver-general of the
charities."</p>

<p id="id10265">"Ma foi," said Monte Cristo; "I think I arrived just in time to obtain
your signatures, or they would have been disputed with me."</p>

<p id="id10266">Danglars again became pale, and hastened to conduct the count out. Monte
Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with M. de Boville, who was standing
in the waiting-room, and who was introduced into Danglars' room as soon
as the count had left. The count's sad face was illumined by a faint
smile, as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver-general held in
his hand. At the door he found his carriage, and was immediately driven
to the bank. Meanwhile Danglars, repressing all emotion, advanced to
meet the receiver-general. We need not say that a smile of condescension
was stamped upon his lips. "Good-morning, creditor," said he; "for I
wager anything it is the creditor who visits me."</p>

<p id="id10267">"You are right, baron," answered M. de Boville; "the charities present
themselves to you through me: the widows and orphans depute me to
receive alms to the amount of five millions from you."</p>

<p id="id10268">"And yet they say orphans are to be pitied," said Danglars, wishing to
prolong the jest. "Poor things!"</p>

<p id="id10269">"Here I am in their name," said M. de Boville; "but did you receive my
letter yesterday?"</p>

<p id="id10270">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id10271">"I have brought my receipt."</p>

<p id="id10272">"My dear M. de Boville, your widows and orphans must oblige me by
waiting twenty-four hours, since M. de Monte Cristo whom you just saw
leaving here&#8212;you did see him, I think?"</p>

<p id="id10273">"Yes; well?"</p>

<p id="id10274">"Well, M. de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions."</p>

<p id="id10275">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id10276">"The count has an unlimited credit upon me; a credit opened by Thomson
&amp; French, of Rome; he came to demand five millions at once, which I paid
him with checks on the bank. My funds are deposited there, and you
can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will
appear rather strange to the governor. Two days will be a different
thing," said Danglars, smiling.</p>

<p id="id10277">"Come," said Boville, with a tone of entire incredulity, "five millions
to that gentleman who just left, and who bowed to me as though he knew
me?"</p>

<p id="id10278">"Perhaps he knows you, though you do not know him; M. de Monte Cristo
knows everybody."</p>

<p id="id10279">"Five millions!"</p>

<p id="id10280">"Here is his receipt. Believe your own eyes." M. de Boville took the
paper Danglars presented him, and read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10281">"Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand
francs, to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson &amp; French of
Rome."</p>

<p id="id10282">"It is really true," said M. de Boville.</p>

<p id="id10283">"Do you know the house of Thomson &amp; French?"</p>

<p id="id10284">"Yes, I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200,000
francs; but since then I have not heard it mentioned."</p>

<p id="id10285">"It is one of the best houses in Europe," said Danglars, carelessly
throwing down the receipt on his desk.</p>

<p id="id10286">"And he had five millions in your hands alone! Why, this Count of Monte<br>

Cristo must be a nabob?"<br></p>

<p id="id10287">"Indeed I do not know what he is; he has three unlimited credits&#8212;one
on me, one on Rothschild, one on Lafitte; and, you see," he added
carelessly, "he has given me the preference, by leaving a balance
of 100,000 francs." M. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary
admiration. "I must visit him," he said, "and obtain some pious grant
from him."</p>

<p id="id10288">"Oh, you may make sure of him; his charities alone amount to 20,000
francs a month."</p>

<p id="id10289">"It is magnificent! I will set before him the example of Madame de<br>

Morcerf and her son."<br></p>

<p id="id10290">"What example?"</p>

<p id="id10291">"They gave all their fortune to the hospitals."</p>

<p id="id10292">"What fortune?"</p>

<p id="id10293">"Their own&#8212;M. de Morcerf's, who is deceased."</p>

<p id="id10294">"For what reason?"</p>

<p id="id10295">"Because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired."</p>

<p id="id10296">"And what are they to live upon?"</p>

<p id="id10297">"The mother retires into the country, and the son enters the army."</p>

<p id="id10298">"Well, I must confess, these are scruples."</p>

<p id="id10299">"I registered their deed of gift yesterday."</p>

<p id="id10300">"And how much did they possess?"</p>

<p id="id10301">"Oh, not much&#8212;from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs. But to
return to our millions."</p>

<p id="id10302">"Certainly," said Danglars, in the most natural tone in the world. "Are
you then pressed for this money?"</p>

<p id="id10303">"Yes; for the examination of our cash takes place to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id10304">"To-morrow? Why did you not tell me so before? Why, it is as good as a
century! At what hour does the examination take place?"</p>

<p id="id10305">"At two o'clock."</p>

<p id="id10306">"Send at twelve," said Danglars, smiling. M. de Boville said nothing,
but nodded his head, and took up the portfolio. "Now I think of it, you
can do better," said Danglars.</p>

<p id="id10307">"How do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id10308">"The receipt of M. de Monte Cristo is as good as money; take it to
Rothschild's or Lafitte's, and they will take it off your hands at
once."</p>

<p id="id10309">"What, though payable at Rome?"</p>

<p id="id10310">"Certainly; it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs."
The receiver started back. "Ma foi," he said, "I prefer waiting till
to-morrow. What a proposition!"</p>

<p id="id10311">"I thought, perhaps," said Danglars with supreme impertinence, "that you
had a deficiency to make up?"</p>

<p id="id10312">"Indeed," said the receiver.</p>

<p id="id10313">"And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some
sacrifice."</p>

<p id="id10314">"Thank you, no, sir."</p>

<p id="id10315">"Then it will be to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id10316">"Yes; but without fail."</p>

<p id="id10317">"Ah, you are laughing at me; send to-morrow at twelve, and the bank
shall be notified."</p>

<p id="id10318">"I will come myself."</p>

<p id="id10319">"Better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you." They
shook hands. "By the way," said M. de Boville, "are you not going to the
funeral of poor Mademoiselle de Villefort, which I met on my road here?"</p>

<p id="id10320">"No," said the banker; "I have appeared rather ridiculous since that
affair of Benedetto, so I remain in the background."</p>

<p id="id10321">"Bah, you are wrong. How were you to blame in that affair?"</p>

<p id="id10322">"Listen&#8212;when one bears an irreproachable name, as I do, one is rather
sensitive."</p>

<p id="id10323">"Everybody pities you, sir; and, above all, Mademoiselle Danglars!"</p>

<p id="id10324">"Poor Eugenie!" said Danglars; "do you know she is going to embrace a
religious life?"</p>

<p id="id10325">"No."</p>

<p id="id10326">"Alas, it is unhappily but too true. The day after the event, she
decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they are gone
to seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain."</p>

<p id="id10327">"Oh, it is terrible!" and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation,
after expressing acute sympathy with the father. But he had scarcely
left before Danglars, with an energy of action those can alone
understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frederic, [*]
exclaimed,&#8212;"Fool!" Then enclosing Monte Cristo's receipt in a little
pocket-book, he added:&#8212;"Yes, come at twelve o'clock; I shall then be
far away." Then he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers,
collected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes, burned several
papers, left others exposed to view, and then commenced writing a letter
which he addressed:</p>

<p id="id10328">"To Madame la Baronne Danglars."</p>

<p id="id10329">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;* Frederic Lemaitre&#8212;French actor (1800-1876). Robert<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Macaire is the hero of two favorite melodramas&#8212;"Chien de<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Montargis" and "Chien d'Aubry"&#8212;and the name is applied to<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;bold criminals as a term of derision.<br></p>

<p id="id10330">"I will place it on her table myself to-night," he murmured. Then taking
a passport from his drawer he said,&#8212;"Good, it is available for two
months longer."</p>

<h3 id="id10331" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 105. The Cemetery of Pere-la-Chaise.</h3>

<p id="id10332">M. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking
Valentine to her last home on earth. The weather was dull and stormy, a
cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the
trees, and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards.
M. de Villefort, a true Parisian, considered the cemetery of
Pere-la-Chaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a
Parisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be
surrounded by worthy associates. He had therefore purchased a vault,
which was quickly occupied by members of his family. On the front of the
monument was inscribed: "The families of Saint-Meran and Villefort," for
such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renee, Valentine's mother.
The pompous procession therefore wended its way towards Pere-la-Chaise
from the Faubourg Saint-Honore. Having crossed Paris, it passed through
the Faubourg du Temple, then leaving the exterior boulevards, it reached
the cemetery. More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty
mourning-coaches, and behind them more than five hundred persons joined
in the procession on foot.</p>

<p id="id10333">These last consisted of all the young people whom Valentine's death had
struck like a thunderbolt, and who, notwithstanding the raw chilliness
of the season, could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the
memory of the beautiful, chaste, and adorable girl, thus cut off in the
flower of her youth. As they left Paris, an equipage with four horses,
at full speed, was seen to draw up suddenly; it contained Monte Cristo.
The count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on
foot. Chateau-Renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his
coupe, joined him.</p>

<p id="id10334">The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was
evidently watching for some one, but his search ended in disappointment.
"Where is Morrel?" he asked; "do either of these gentlemen know where he
is?"</p>

<p id="id10335">"We have already asked that question," said Chateau-Renaud, "for none
of us has seen him." The count was silent, but continued to gaze around
him. At length they arrived at the cemetery. The piercing eye of Monte
Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees, and was soon
relieved from all anxiety, for seeing a shadow glide between the
yew-trees, Monte Cristo recognized him whom he sought. One funeral is
generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis. Black
figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues; the silence
of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling
branches of hedges planted around the monuments; then follows the
melancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then with a sob of
anguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers.</p>

<p id="id10336">The shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of
Abelard and Heloise, placed itself close to the heads of the horses
belonging to the hearse, and following the undertaker's men, arrived
with them at the spot appointed for the burial. Each person's attention
was occupied. Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow, which no one else
observed. Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of
his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes. When the
procession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with
his coat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively
crushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated
on an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral
details could escape his observation. Everything was conducted in
the usual manner. A few men, the least impressed of all by the scene,
pronounced a discourse, some deploring this premature death, others
expatiating on the grief of the father, and one very ingenious person
quoting the fact that Valentine had solicited pardon of her father for
criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall&#8212;until at length
they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches.</p>

<p id="id10337">Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw Morrel, whose
calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in
his heart. "See," said Beauchamp, pointing out Morrel to Debray. "What
is he doing up there?" And they called Chateau-Renaud's attention to
him.</p>

<p id="id10338">"How pale he is!" said Chateau-Renaud, shuddering.</p>

<p id="id10339">"He is cold," said Debray.</p>

<p id="id10340">"Not at all," said Chateau-Renaud, slowly; "I think he is violently
agitated. He is very susceptible."</p>

<p id="id10341">"Bah," said Debray; "he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort; you
said so yourself."</p>

<p id="id10342">"True. Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de
Morcerf's. Do you recollect that ball, count, where you produced such an
effect?"</p>

<p id="id10343">"No, I do not," replied Monte Cristo, without even knowing of what or
to whom he was speaking, so much was he occupied in watching Morrel, who
was holding his breath with emotion. "The discourse is over; farewell,
gentlemen," said the count. And he disappeared without anyone seeing
whither he went. The funeral being over, the guests returned to Paris.
Chateau-Renaud looked for a moment for Morrel; but while they were
watching the departure of the count, Morrel had quitted his post, and
Chateau-Renaud, failing in his search, joined Debray and Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id10344">Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the
arrival of Morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned
by spectators and workmen. Morrel threw a glance around, but before it
reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet
nearer, still unperceived. The young man knelt down. The count, with
outstretched neck and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to
pounce upon Morrel upon the first occasion. Morrel bent his head till
it touched the stone, then clutching the grating with both hands,
he murmured,&#8212;"Oh, Valentine!" The count's heart was pierced by the
utterance of these two words; he stepped forward, and touching the young
man's shoulder, said,&#8212;"I was looking for you, my friend." Monte Cristo
expected a burst of passion, but he was deceived, for Morrel turning
round, said calmly,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10345">"You see I was praying." The scrutinizing glance of the count searched
the young man from head to foot. He then seemed more easy.</p>

<p id="id10346">"Shall I drive you back to Paris?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id10347">"No, thank you."</p>

<p id="id10348">"Do you wish anything?"</p>

<p id="id10349">"Leave me to pray." The count withdrew without opposition, but it was
only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement
of Morrel, who at length arose, brushed the dust from his knees, and
turned towards Paris, without once looking back. He walked slowly down
the Rue de la Roquette. The count, dismissing his carriage, followed him
about a hundred paces behind. Maximilian crossed the canal and entered
the Rue Meslay by the boulevards. Five minutes after the door had been
closed on Morrel's entrance, it was again opened for the count. Julie
was at the entrance of the garden, where she was attentively watching
Penelon, who, entering with zeal into his profession of gardener, was
very busy grafting some Bengal roses. "Ah, count," she exclaimed, with
the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited
the Rue Meslay.</p>

<p id="id10350">"Maximilian has just returned, has he not, madame?" asked the count.</p>

<p id="id10351">"Yes, I think I saw him pass; but pray, call Emmanuel."</p>

<p id="id10352">"Excuse me, madame, but I must go up to Maximilian's room this instant,"
replied Monte Cristo, "I have something of the greatest importance to
tell him."</p>

<p id="id10353">"Go, then," she said with a charming smile, which accompanied him until
he had disappeared. Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting
from the ground-floor to Maximilian's room; when he reached the landing
he listened attentively, but all was still. Like many old houses
occupied by a single family, the room door was panelled with glass; but
it was locked, Maximilian was shut in, and it was impossible to see
what was passing in the room, because a red curtain was drawn before the
glass. The count's anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom
appeared on the face of that imperturbable man.</p>

<p id="id10354">"What shall I do!" he uttered, and reflected for a moment; "shall I
ring? No, the sound of a bell, announcing a visitor, will but accelerate
the resolution of one in Maximilian's situation, and then the bell would
be followed by a louder noise." Monte Cristo trembled from head to
foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of
lightning, he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow; the glass
was shivered to atoms, then withdrawing the curtain he saw Morrel, who
had been writing at his desk, bound from his seat at the noise of the
broken window.</p>

<p id="id10355">"I beg a thousand pardons," said the count, "there is nothing the
matter, but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with
my elbow. Since it is opened, I will take advantage of it to enter your
room; do not disturb yourself&#8212;do not disturb yourself!" And passing
his hand through the broken glass, the count opened the door. Morrel,
evidently discomposed, came to meet Monte Cristo less with the intention
of receiving him than to exclude his entry. "Ma foi," said Monte Cristo,
rubbing his elbow, "it's all your servant's fault; your stairs are so
polished, it is like walking on glass."</p>

<p id="id10356">"Are you hurt, sir?" coldly asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id10357">"I believe not. But what are you about there? You were writing."</p>

<h5 id="id10358">"I?"</h5>

<p id="id10359">"Your fingers are stained with ink."</p>

<p id="id10360">"Ah, true, I was writing. I do sometimes, soldier though I am."</p>

<p id="id10361">Monte Cristo advanced into the room; Maximilian was obliged to let him
pass, but he followed him. "You were writing?" said Monte Cristo with a
searching look.</p>

<p id="id10362">"I have already had the honor of telling you I was," said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id10363">The count looked around him. "Your pistols are beside your desk," said<br>

Monte Cristo, pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table.<br></p>

<p id="id10364">"I am on the point of starting on a journey," replied Morrel
disdainfully.</p>

<p id="id10365">"My friend," exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness.</p>

<p id="id10366">"Sir?"</p>

<p id="id10367">"My friend, my dear Maximilian, do not make a hasty resolution, I
entreat you."</p>

<p id="id10368">"I make a hasty resolution?" said Morrel, shrugging his shoulders; "is
there anything extraordinary in a journey?"</p>

<p id="id10369">"Maximilian," said the count, "let us both lay aside the mask we have
assumed. You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose
upon you with my frivolous solicitude. You can understand, can you not,
that to have acted as I have done, to have broken that glass, to have
intruded on the solitude of a friend&#8212;you can understand that, to have
done all this, I must have been actuated by real uneasiness, or rather
by a terrible conviction. Morrel, you are going to destroy yourself!"</p>

<p id="id10370">"Indeed, count," said Morrel, shuddering; "what has put this into your
head?"</p>

<p id="id10371">"I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself," continued the
count, "and here is proof of what I say;" and, approaching the desk, he
removed the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the letter he
had begun, and took the latter in his hands.</p>

<p id="id10372">Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him, but Monte Cristo perceiving
his intention, seized his wrist with his iron grasp. "You wish to
destroy yourself," said the count; "you have written it."</p>

<p id="id10373">"Well," said Morrel, changing his expression of calmness for one of
violence&#8212;"well, and if I do intend to turn this pistol against myself,
who shall prevent me&#8212;who will dare prevent me? All my hopes are
blighted, my heart is broken, my life a burden, everything around me is
sad and mournful; earth has become distasteful to me, and human voices
distract me. It is a mercy to let me die, for if I live I shall lose
my reason and become mad. When, sir, I tell you all this with tears of
heartfelt anguish, can you reply that I am wrong, can you prevent my
putting an end to my miserable existence? Tell me, sir, could you have
the courage to do so?"</p>

<p id="id10374">"Yes, Morrel," said Monte Cristo, with a calmness which contrasted
strangely with the young man's excitement; "yes, I would do so."</p>

<p id="id10375">"You?" exclaimed Morrel, with increasing anger and reproach&#8212;"you, who
have deceived me with false hopes, who have cheered and soothed me with
vain promises, when I might, if not have saved her, at least have seen
her die in my arms! You, who pretend to understand everything, even the
hidden sources of knowledge,&#8212;and who enact the part of a guardian angel
upon earth, and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered
to a young girl! Ah, sir, indeed you would inspire me with pity, were
you not hateful in my eyes."</p>

<p id="id10376">"Morrel"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10377">"Yes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and I will do so, be satisfied!
When you spoke to me at the cemetery, I answered you&#8212;my heart was
softened; when you arrived here, I allowed you to enter. But since
you abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture after
I thought I had exhausted them all, then, Count of Monte Cristo my
pretended benefactor&#8212;then, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal
guardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;" and
Morrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols.</p>

<p id="id10378">"And I again repeat, you shall not commit suicide."</p>

<p id="id10379">"Prevent me, then!" replied Morrel, with another struggle, which, like
the first, failed in releasing him from the count's iron grasp.</p>

<p id="id10380">"I will prevent you."</p>

<p id="id10381">"And who are you, then, that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right
over free and rational beings?"</p>

<p id="id10382">"Who am I?" repeated Monte Cristo. "Listen; I am the only man in the
world having the right to say to you, 'Morrel, your father's son shall
not die to-day;'" and Monte Cristo, with an expression of majesty
and sublimity, advanced with arms folded toward the young man, who,
involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man, recoiled a
step.</p>

<p id="id10383">"Why do you mention my father?" stammered he; "why do you mingle a
recollection of him with the affairs of today?"</p>

<p id="id10384">"Because I am he who saved your father's life when he wished to destroy
himself, as you do to-day&#8212;because I am the man who sent the purse
to your young sister, and the Pharaon to old Morrel&#8212;because I am the
Edmond Dantes who nursed you, a child, on my knees." Morrel made another
step back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then all his strength
give way, and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte Cristo. Then his
admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion; he arose,
rushed out of the room and to the stairs, exclaiming energetically,
"Julie, Julie&#8212;Emmanuel, Emmanuel!"</p>

<p id="id10385">Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave, but Maximilian would have died
rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed
upon the count. Julie, Emmanuel, and some of the servants, ran up in
alarm on hearing the cries of Maximilian. Morrel seized their hands,
and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs, "On your
knees&#8212;on your knees&#8212;he is our benefactor&#8212;the saviour of our father!
He is"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10386">He would have added "Edmond Dantes," but the count seized his arm and
prevented him. Julie threw herself into the arms of the count; Emmanuel
embraced him as a guardian angel; Morrel again fell on his knees, and
struck the ground with his forehead. Then the iron-hearted man felt his
heart swell in his breast; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his
eyes, he bent his head and wept. For a while nothing was heard in the
room but a succession of sobs, while the incense from their grateful
hearts mounted to heaven. Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep
emotion when she rushed out of the room, descended to the next floor,
ran into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal
globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the Allees de
Meillan. Meanwhile, Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count,
"Oh, count, how could you, hearing us so often speak of our unknown
benefactor, seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his
memory,&#8212;how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to
us? Oh, it was cruel to us, and&#8212;dare I say it?&#8212;to you also."</p>

<p id="id10387">"Listen, my friends," said the count&#8212;"I may call you so since we have
really been friends for the last eleven years&#8212;the discovery of this
secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know.
I wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom, but your brother
Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now, I am
sure." Then turning around, and seeing that Morrel, still on his knees,
had thrown himself into an arm-chair, he added in a low voice, pressing
Emmanuel's hand significantly, "Watch over him."</p>

<p id="id10388">"Why so?" asked the young man, surprised.</p>

<p id="id10389">"I cannot explain myself; but watch over him." Emmanuel looked around
the room and caught sight of the pistols; his eyes rested on the
weapons, and he pointed to them. Monte Cristo bent his head. Emmanuel
went towards the pistols. "Leave them," said Monte Cristo. Then walking
towards Morrel, he took his hand; the tumultuous agitation of the young
man was succeeded by a profound stupor. Julie returned, holding the
silken purse in her hands, while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks,
like dewdrops on the rose.</p>

<p id="id10390">"Here is the relic," she said; "do not think it will be less dear to us
now we are acquainted with our benefactor!"</p>

<p id="id10391">"My child," said Monte Cristo, coloring, "allow me to take back that
purse? Since you now know my face, I wish to be remembered alone through
the affection I hope you will grant me.</p>

<p id="id10392">"Oh," said Julie, pressing the purse to her heart, "no, no, I beseech
you do not take it, for some unhappy day you will leave us, will you
not?"</p>

<p id="id10393">"You have guessed rightly, madame," replied Monte Cristo, smiling; "in a
week I shall have left this country, where so many persons who merit the
vengeance of heaven lived happily, while my father perished of hunger
and grief." While announcing his departure, the count fixed his eyes on
Morrel, and remarked that the words, "I shall have left this country,"
had failed to rouse him from his lethargy. He then saw that he must make
another struggle against the grief of his friend, and taking the hands
of Emmanuel and Julie, which he pressed within his own, he said with
the mild authority of a father, "My kind friends, leave me alone with
Maximilian." Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious
relic, which Monte Cristo had forgotten. She drew her husband to the
door. "Let us leave them," she said. The count was alone with Morrel,
who remained motionless as a statue.</p>

<p id="id10394">"Come," said Monte-Cristo, touching his shoulder with his finger, "are
you a man again, Maximilian?"</p>

<p id="id10395">"Yes; for I begin to suffer again."</p>

<p id="id10396">The count frowned, apparently in gloomy hesitation.</p>

<p id="id10397">"Maximilian, Maximilian," he said, "the ideas you yield to are unworthy
of a Christian."</p>

<p id="id10398">"Oh, do not fear, my friend," said Morrel, raising his head, and smiling
with a sweet expression on the count; "I shall no longer attempt my
life."</p>

<p id="id10399">"Then we are to have no more pistols&#8212;no more despair?"</p>

<p id="id10400">"No; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a
knife."</p>

<p id="id10401">"Poor fellow, what is it?"</p>

<p id="id10402">"My grief will kill me of itself."</p>

<p id="id10403">"My friend," said Monte Cristo, with an expression of melancholy equal
to his own, "listen to me. One day, in a moment of despair like yours,
since it led to a similar resolution, I also wished to kill myself; one
day your father, equally desperate, wished to kill himself too. If any
one had said to your father, at the moment he raised the pistol to his
head&#8212;if any one had told me, when in my prison I pushed back the food I
had not tasted for three days&#8212;if anyone had said to either of us
then, 'Live&#8212;the day will come when you will be happy, and will bless
life!'&#8212;no matter whose voice had spoken, we should have heard him with
the smile of doubt, or the anguish of incredulity,&#8212;and yet how many
times has your father blessed life while embracing you&#8212;how often have I
myself"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10404">"Ah," exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the count, "you had only lost
your liberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but I have lost
Valentine."</p>

<p id="id10405">"Look at me," said Monte Cristo, with that expression which sometimes
made him so eloquent and persuasive&#8212;"look at me. There are no tears
in my eyes, nor is there fever in my veins, yet I see you suffer&#8212;you,
Maximilian, whom I love as my own son. Well, does not this tell you
that in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to
beyond? Now, if I entreat, if I order you to live, Morrel, it is in
the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your
life."</p>

<p id="id10406">"Oh, heavens," said the young man, "oh, heavens&#8212;what are you saying,
count? Take care. But perhaps you have never loved!"</p>

<p id="id10407">"Child!" replied the count.</p>

<p id="id10408">"I mean, as I love. You see, I have been a soldier ever since I attained
manhood. I reached the age of twenty-nine without loving, for none of
the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of love.
Well, at twenty-nine I saw Valentine; for two years I have loved her,
for two years I have seen written in her heart, as in a book, all the
virtues of a daughter and wife. Count, to possess Valentine would have
been a happiness too infinite, too ecstatic, too complete, too divine
for this world, since it has been denied me; but without Valentine the
earth is desolate."</p>

<p id="id10409">"I have told you to hope," said the count.</p>

<p id="id10410">"Then have a care, I repeat, for you seek to persuade me, and if you
succeed I should lose my reason, for I should hope that I could again
behold Valentine." The count smiled. "My friend, my father," said Morrel
with excitement, "have a care, I again repeat, for the power you wield
over me alarms me. Weigh your words before you speak, for my eyes have
already become brighter, and my heart beats strongly; be cautious, or
you will make me believe in supernatural agencies. I must obey you,
though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water."</p>

<p id="id10411">"Hope, my friend," repeated the count.</p>

<p id="id10412">"Ah," said Morrel, falling from the height of excitement to the abyss
of despair&#8212;"ah, you are playing with me, like those good, or rather
selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words, because
their screams annoy them. No, my friend, I was wrong to caution you; do
not fear, I will bury my grief so deep in my heart, I will disguise
it so, that you shall not even care to sympathize with me. Adieu, my
friend, adieu!"</p>

<p id="id10413">"On the contrary," said the count, "after this time you must live with
me&#8212;you must not leave me, and in a week we shall have left France
behind us."</p>

<p id="id10414">"And you still bid me hope?"</p>

<p id="id10415">"I tell you to hope, because I have a method of curing you."</p>

<p id="id10416">"Count, you render me sadder than before, if it be possible. You think
the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief, and
you would cure it by an ordinary remedy&#8212;change of scene." And Morrel
dropped his head with disdainful incredulity. "What can I say more?"
asked Monte Cristo. "I have confidence in the remedy I propose, and only
ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy."</p>

<p id="id10417">"Count, you prolong my agony."</p>

<p id="id10418">"Then," said the count, "your feeble spirit will not even grant me the
trial I request? Come&#8212;do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is
capable? do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?
nay, that he can almost work a miracle? Well, wait for the miracle I
hope to accomplish, or"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10419">"Or?" repeated Morrel.</p>

<p id="id10420">"Or, take care, Morrel, lest I call you ungrateful."</p>

<p id="id10421">"Have pity on me, count!"</p>

<p id="id10422">"I feel so much pity towards you, Maximilian, that&#8212;listen to me
attentively&#8212;if I do not cure you in a month, to the day, to the very
hour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place loaded pistols before you,
and a cup of the deadliest Italian poison&#8212;a poison more sure and prompt
than that which has killed Valentine."</p>

<p id="id10423">"Will you promise me?"</p>

<p id="id10424">"Yes; for I am a man, and have suffered like yourself, and also
contemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune has left me I have
longed for the delights of an eternal sleep."</p>

<p id="id10425">"But you are sure you will promise me this?" said Morrel, intoxicated.
"I not only promise, but swear it!" said Monte Cristo extending his
hand.</p>

<p id="id10426">"In a month, then, on your honor, if I am not consoled, you will let
me take my life into my own hands, and whatever may happen you will not
call me ungrateful?"</p>

<p id="id10427">"In a month, to the day, the very hour and the date are sacred,
Maximilian. I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of
September; it is ten years to-day since I saved your father's life, who
wished to die." Morrel seized the count's hand and kissed it; the count
allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him. "In a month you will
find on the table, at which we shall be then sitting, good pistols and
a delicious draught; but, on the other hand, you must promise me not to
attempt your life before that time."</p>

<p id="id10428">"Oh, I also swear it!" Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him,
and pressed him for some time to his heart. "And now," he said,
"after to-day, you will come and live with me; you can occupy Haidee's
apartment, and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son."</p>

<p id="id10429">"Haidee?" said Morrel, "what has become of her?"</p>

<p id="id10430">"She departed last night."</p>

<p id="id10431">"To leave you?"</p>

<p id="id10432">"To wait for me. Hold yourself ready then to join me at the Champs
Elysees, and lead me out of this house without any one seeing my
departure." Maximilian hung his head, and obeyed with childlike
reverence.</p>

<h3 id="id10433" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 106. Dividing the Proceeds.</h3>

<p id="id10434">The apartment on the second floor of the house in the Rue
Saint-Germain-des-Pres, where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for
his mother, was let to a very mysterious person. This was a man whose
face the concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin
was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen's
coachmen on a cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always
blowing his nose just as he approached the door. Contrary to custom,
this gentleman had not been watched, for as the report ran that he was
a person of high rank, and one who would allow no impertinent
interference, his incognito was strictly respected.</p>

<p id="id10435">His visits were tolerably regular, though occasionally he appeared
a little before or after his time, but generally, both in summer and
winter, he took possession of his apartment about four o'clock, though
he never spent the night there. At half-past three in the winter the
fire was lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence of
the little apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the table
at the same hour. At four o'clock, as we have already stated, the
mysterious personage arrived. Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage
stopped at the house, a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress, and
always thickly veiled; she passed like a shadow through the lodge, and
ran up-stairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light
foot. No one ever asked her where she was going. Her face, therefore,
like that of the gentleman, was perfectly unknown to the two concierges,
who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion.
We need not say she stopped at the second floor. Then she tapped in a
peculiar manner at a door, which after being opened to admit her was
again fastened, and curiosity penetrated no farther. They used the same
precautions in leaving as in entering the house. The lady always left
first, and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage, it drove away,
sometimes towards the right hand, sometimes to the left; then about
twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave, buried in his
cravat or concealed by his handkerchief.</p>

<p id="id10436">The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars, the mysterious
lodger entered at ten o'clock in the morning instead of four in the
afternoon. Almost directly afterwards, without the usual interval of
time, a cab arrived, and the veiled lady ran hastily up-stairs. The
door opened, but before it could be closed, the lady exclaimed: "Oh,
Lucien&#8212;oh, my friend!" The concierge therefore heard for the first time
that the lodger's name was Lucien; still, as he was the very perfection
of a door-keeper, he made up his mind not to tell his wife. "Well,
what is the matter, my dear?" asked the gentleman whose name the lady's
agitation revealed; "tell me what is the matter."</p>

<p id="id10437">"Oh, Lucien, can I confide in you?"</p>

<p id="id10438">"Of course, you know you can do so. But what can be the matter?
Your note of this morning has completely bewildered me. This
precipitation&#8212;this unusual appointment. Come, ease me of my anxiety, or
else frighten me at once."</p>

<p id="id10439">"Lucien, a great event has happened!" said the lady, glancing
inquiringly at Lucien,&#8212;"M. Danglars left last night!"</p>

<p id="id10440">"Left?&#8212;M. Danglars left? Where has he gone?"</p>

<p id="id10441">"I do not know."</p>

<p id="id10442">"What do you mean? Has he gone intending not to return?"</p>

<p id="id10443">"Undoubtedly;&#8212;at ten o'clock at night his horses took him to the
barrier of Charenton; there a post-chaise was waiting for him&#8212;he
entered it with his valet de chambre, saying that he was going to
Fontainebleau."</p>

<p id="id10444">"Then what did you mean"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10445">"Stay&#8212;he left a letter for me."</p>

<p id="id10446">"A letter?"</p>

<p id="id10447">"Yes; read it." And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she
gave to Debray. Debray paused a moment before reading, as if trying
to guess its contents, or perhaps while making up his mind how to act,
whatever it might contain. No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few
minutes, for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness
in the heart of the baroness, and which ran as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10448">"Madame and most faithful wife."</p>

<p id="id10449">Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness, whose face
became covered with blushes. "Read," she said.</p>

<p id="id10450">Debray continued:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10451">"When you receive this, you will no longer have a husband. Oh, you
need not be alarmed, you will only have lost him as you have lost your
daughter; I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or
forty roads leading out of France. I owe you some explanations for my
conduct, and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me, I will
give them. Listen, then. I received this morning five millions which I
paid away; almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum
was presented to me; I put this creditor off till to-morrow and I intend
leaving to-day, to escape that to-morrow, which would be rather too
unpleasant for me to endure. You understand this, do you not, my most
precious wife? I say you understand this, because you are as conversant
with my affairs as I am; indeed, I think you understand them better,
since I am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my
fortune, once very tolerable, while I am sure, madame, that you know
perfectly well. For women have infallible instincts; they can even
explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented;
but I, who only understand my own figures, know nothing more than that
one day these figures deceived me. Have you admired the rapidity of my
fall? Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?
I confess I have seen nothing but the fire; let us hope you have found
some gold among the ashes. With this consoling idea, I leave you,
madame, and most prudent wife, without any conscientious reproach for
abandoning you; you have friends left, and the ashes I have already
mentioned, and above all the liberty I hasten to restore to you. And
here, madame, I must add another word of explanation. So long as I hoped
you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our
daughter, I philosophically closed my eyes; but as you have transformed
that house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of another
man's fortune. You were rich when I married you, but little respected.
Excuse me for speaking so very candidly, but as this is intended
only for ourselves, I do not see why I should weigh my words. I have
augmented our fortune, and it has continued to increase during the
last fifteen years, till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes
have suddenly overturned it,&#8212;without any fault of mine, I can honestly
declare. You, madame, have only sought to increase your own, and I am
convinced that you have succeeded. I leave you, therefore, as I took
you,&#8212;rich, but little respected. Adieu! I also intend from this time
to work on my own account. Accept my acknowledgments for the example you
have set me, and which I intend following.</p>

<p id="id10452">"Your very devoted husband,</p>

<p id="id10453">"Baron Danglars."</p>

<p id="id10454">The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful
letter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color
once or twice. When he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and
resumed his pensive attitude. "Well?" asked Madame Danglars, with an
anxiety easy to be understood.</p>

<p id="id10455">"Well, madame?" unhesitatingly repeated Debray.</p>

<p id="id10456">"With what ideas does that letter inspire you?"</p>

<p id="id10457">"Oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that M.<br>

Danglars has left suspiciously."<br></p>

<p id="id10458">"Certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?"</p>

<p id="id10459">"I do not understand you," said Debray with freezing coldness.</p>

<p id="id10460">"He is gone! Gone, never to return!"</p>

<p id="id10461">"Oh, madame, do not think that!"</p>

<p id="id10462">"I tell you he will never return. I know his character; he is inflexible
in any resolutions formed for his own interests. If he could have made
any use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me in Paris,
as our separation will conduce to his benefit;&#8212;therefore he has gone,
and I am free forever," added Madame Danglars, in the same supplicating
tone. Debray, instead of answering, allowed her to remain in an attitude
of nervous inquiry. "Well?" she said at length, "do you not answer me?"</p>

<p id="id10463">"I have but one question to ask you,&#8212;what do you intend to do?"</p>

<p id="id10464">"I was going to ask you," replied the baroness with a beating heart.</p>

<p id="id10465">"Ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?"</p>

<p id="id10466">"Yes; I do wish to ask your advice," said Madame Danglars with anxious
expectation.</p>

<p id="id10467">"Then if you wish to take my advice," said the young man coldly, "I
would recommend you to travel."</p>

<p id="id10468">"To travel!" she murmured.</p>

<p id="id10469">"Certainly; as M. Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free. In
my opinion, a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the
double catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars' broken contract and M.
Danglars' disappearance. The world will think you abandoned and poor,
for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven, were she to keep up
an appearance of opulence. You have only to remain in Paris for about a
fortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the details
of this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread the report.
Then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and giving up your
jointure, and every one's mouth will be filled with praises of your
disinterestedness. They will know you are deserted, and think you also
poor, for I alone know your real financial position, and am quite ready
to give up my accounts as an honest partner." The dread with which the
pale and motionless baroness listened to this, was equalled by the calm
indifference with which Debray had spoken. "Deserted?" she repeated;
"ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted! You are right, sir, and no one can
doubt my position." These were the only words that this proud and
violently enamoured woman could utter in response to Debray.</p>

<p id="id10470">"But then you are rich,&#8212;very rich, indeed," continued Debray, taking
out some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table.
Madame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the
beatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to
gush forth. At length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not
entirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the
fall of a single tear. "Madame," said Debray, "it is nearly six months
since we have been associated. You furnished a principal of 100,000
francs. Our partnership began in the month of April. In May we commenced
operations, and in the course of the month gained 450,000 francs.
In June the profit amounted to 900,000. In July we added 1,700,000
francs,&#8212;it was, you know, the month of the Spanish bonds. In August we
lost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month, but on the 13th we
made up for it, and we now find that our accounts, reckoning from the
first day of partnership up to yesterday, when I closed them, showed
a capital of 2,400,000 francs, that is, 1,200,000 for each of us. Now,
madame," said Debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical
manner of a stockbroker, "there are still 80,000 francs, the interest of
this money, in my hands."</p>

<p id="id10471">"But," said the baroness, "I thought you never put the money out to
interest."</p>

<p id="id10472">"Excuse me, madame," said Debray coldly, "I had your permission to do
so, and I have made use of it. There are, then, 40,000 francs for your
share, besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with, making in all
1,340,000 francs for your portion. Now, madame, I took the precaution of
drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is not long ago, you
see, and I was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up
my accounts. There is your money,&#8212;half in bank-notes, the other half
in checks payable to bearer. I say there, for as I did not consider
my house safe enough, or lawyers sufficiently discreet, and as landed
property carries evidence with it, and moreover since you have no right
to possess anything independent of your husband, I have kept this sum,
now your whole fortune, in a chest concealed under that closet, and for
greater security I myself concealed it there.</p>
