<p id="id05520">"Why?&#8212;what do you mean by that question?"</p>

<p id="id05521">"I mean that if there were, it would be impossible to draw up with
impunity two such deeds as these. In France, my dear sir, half such a
piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to
Toulon for five years, for change of air."</p>

<p id="id05522">"Will you be good enough to explain your meaning?" said the major,
endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest
majesty.</p>

<p id="id05523">"My dear M. Cavalcanti," said Andrea, taking the major by the arm in a
confidential manner, "how much are you paid for being my father?" The
major was about to speak, when Andrea continued, in a low voice.</p>

<p id="id05524">"Nonsense, I am going to set you an example of confidence, they give me
50,000 francs a year to be your son; consequently, you can understand
that it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent." The major
looked anxiously around him. "Make yourself easy, we are quite alone,"
said Andrea; "besides, we are conversing in Italian."</p>

<p id="id05525">"Well, then," replied the major, "they paid me 50,000 francs down."</p>

<p id="id05526">"Monsieur Cavalcanti," said Andrea, "do you believe in fairy tales?"</p>

<p id="id05527">"I used not to do so, but I really feel now almost obliged to have faith
in them."</p>

<p id="id05528">"You have, then, been induced to alter your opinion; you have had some
proofs of their truth?" The major drew from his pocket a handful of
gold. "Most palpable proofs," said he, "as you may perceive."</p>

<p id="id05529">"You think, then, that I may rely on the count's promises?"</p>

<p id="id05530">"Certainly I do."</p>

<p id="id05531">"You are sure he will keep his word with me?"</p>

<p id="id05532">"To the letter, but at the same time, remember, we must continue to play
our respective parts. I, as a tender father"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05533">"And I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended from
you."</p>

<p id="id05534">"Whom do you mean by they?"</p>

<p id="id05535">"Ma foi, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who wrote the
letter; you received one, did you not?"</p>

<p id="id05536">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05537">"From whom?"</p>

<p id="id05538">"From a certain Abbe Busoni."</p>

<p id="id05539">"Have you any knowledge of him?"</p>

<p id="id05540">"No, I have never seen him."</p>

<p id="id05541">"What did he say in the letter?"</p>

<p id="id05542">"You will promise not to betray me?"</p>

<p id="id05543">"Rest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same."</p>

<p id="id05544">"Then read for yourself;" and the major gave a letter into the young
man's hand. Andrea read in a low voice&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05545">"You are poor; a miserable old age awaits you. Would you like to become
rich, or at least independent? Set out immediately for Paris, and demand
of the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs Elysees, No. 30, the son
whom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari, and who was taken from you at
five years of age. This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti. In order that
you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter, you
will find enclosed an order for 2,400 francs, payable in Florence, at
Signor Gozzi's; also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte
Cristo, on whom I give you a draft of 48,000 francs. Remember to go to
the count on the 26th May at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p id="id05546">(Signed)</p>

<p id="id05547">"Abbe Busoni."</p>

<p id="id05548">"It is the same."</p>

<p id="id05549">"What do you mean?" said the major.</p>

<p id="id05550">"I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same effect."</p>

<p id="id05551">"You?"</p>

<p id="id05552">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05553">"From the Abbe Busoni?"</p>

<p id="id05554">"No."</p>

<p id="id05555">"From whom, then?"</p>

<p id="id05556">"From an Englishman, called Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of Sinbad
the Sailor."</p>

<p id="id05557">"And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abbe Busoni?"</p>

<p id="id05558">"You are mistaken; there I am ahead of you."</p>

<p id="id05559">"You have seen him, then?"</p>

<p id="id05560">"Yes, once."</p>

<p id="id05561">"Where?"</p>

<p id="id05562">"Ah, that is just what I cannot tell you; if I did, I should make you as
wise as myself, which it is not my intention to do."</p>

<p id="id05563">"And what did the letter contain?"</p>

<p id="id05564">"Read it."</p>

<p id="id05565">"'You are poor, and your future prospects are dark and gloomy. Do you
wish for a name? should you like to be rich, and your own master?'"</p>

<p id="id05566">"Ma foi," said the young man; "was it possible there could be two
answers to such a question?"</p>

<p id="id05567">"Take the post-chaise which you will find waiting at the Porte de Genes,
as you enter Nice; pass through Turin, Chambery, and Pont-de-Beauvoisin.
Go to the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs Elysees, on the 26th
of May, at seven o'clock in the evening, and demand of him your father.
You are the son of the Marchese Cavalcanti and the Marchesa Oliva
Corsinari. The marquis will give you some papers which will certify this
fact, and authorize you to appear under that name in the Parisian world.
As to your rank, an annual income of 50,000 livres will enable you to
support it admirably. I enclose a draft for 5,000 livres, payable on M.
Ferrea, banker at Nice, and also a letter of introduction to the Count
of Monte Cristo, whom I have directed to supply all your wants.</p>

<p id="id05568">"Sinbad the Sailor."</p>

<p id="id05569">"Humph," said the major; "very good. You have seen the count, you say?"</p>

<p id="id05570">"I have only just left him."</p>

<p id="id05571">"And has he conformed to all that the letter specified?"</p>

<p id="id05572">"He has."</p>

<p id="id05573">"Do you understand it?"</p>

<p id="id05574">"Not in the least."</p>

<p id="id05575">"There is a dupe somewhere."</p>

<p id="id05576">"At all events, it is neither you nor I."</p>

<p id="id05577">"Certainly not."</p>

<p id="id05578">"Well, then"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05579">"Why, it does not much concern us, do you think it does?"</p>

<p id="id05580">"No; I agree with you there. We must play the game to the end, and
consent to be blindfolded."</p>

<p id="id05581">"Ah, you shall see; I promise you I will sustain my part to admiration."</p>

<p id="id05582">"I never once doubted your doing so." Monte Cristo chose this moment for
re-entering the drawing-room. On hearing the sound of his footsteps, the
two men threw themselves in each other's arms, and while they were in
the midst of this embrace, the count entered. "Well, marquis," said
Monte Cristo, "you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom
your good fortune has restored to you."</p>

<p id="id05583">"Ah, your excellency, I am overwhelmed with delight."</p>

<p id="id05584">"And what are your feelings?" said Monte Cristo, turning to the young
man.</p>

<p id="id05585">"As for me, my heart is overflowing with happiness."</p>

<p id="id05586">"Happy father, happy son!" said the count.</p>

<p id="id05587">"There is only one thing which grieves me," observed the major, "and
that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon."</p>

<p id="id05588">"Ah, my dear M. Cavalcanti, I trust you will not leave before I have had
the honor of presenting you to some of my friends."</p>

<p id="id05589">"I am at your service, sir," replied the major.</p>

<p id="id05590">"Now, sir," said Monte Cristo, addressing Andrea, "make your
confession."</p>

<p id="id05591">"To whom?"</p>

<p id="id05592">"Tell M. Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances."</p>

<p id="id05593">"Ma foi, monsieur, you have touched upon a tender chord."</p>

<p id="id05594">"Do you hear what he says, major?"</p>

<p id="id05595">"Certainly I do."</p>

<p id="id05596">"But do you understand?"</p>

<p id="id05597">"I do."</p>

<p id="id05598">"Your son says he requires money."</p>

<p id="id05599">"Well, what would you have me do?" said the major.</p>

<p id="id05600">"You should furnish him with some of course," replied Monte Cristo.</p>

<h5 id="id05601">"I?"</h5>

<p id="id05602">"Yes, you," said the count, at the same time advancing towards Andrea,
and slipping a packet of bank-notes into the young man's hand.</p>

<p id="id05603">"What is this?"</p>

<p id="id05604">"It is from your father."</p>

<p id="id05605">"From my father?"</p>

<p id="id05606">"Yes; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money? Well, then,
he deputes me to give you this."</p>

<p id="id05607">"Am I to consider this as part of my income on account?"</p>

<p id="id05608">"No, it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris."</p>

<p id="id05609">"Ah, how good my dear father is!"</p>

<p id="id05610">"Silence," said Monte Cristo; "he does not wish you to know that it
comes from him."</p>

<p id="id05611">"I fully appreciate his delicacy," said Andrea, cramming the notes
hastily into his pocket.</p>

<p id="id05612">"And now, gentlemen, I wish you good-morning," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05613">"And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?"
asked Cavalcanti.</p>

<p id="id05614">"Ah," said Andrea, "when may we hope for that pleasure?"</p>

<p id="id05615">"On Saturday, if you will&#8212;Yes.&#8212;Let me see&#8212;Saturday&#8212;I am to dine at
my country house, at Auteuil, on that day, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28.
Several persons are invited, and among others, M. Danglars, your banker.
I will introduce you to him, for it will be necessary he should know
you, as he is to pay your money."</p>

<p id="id05616">"Full dress?" said the major, half aloud.</p>

<p id="id05617">"Oh, yes, certainly," said the count; "uniform, cross, knee-breeches."</p>

<p id="id05618">"And how shall I be dressed?" demanded Andrea.</p>

<p id="id05619">"Oh, very simply; black trousers, patent leather boots, white waistcoat,
either a black or blue coat, and a long cravat. Go to Blin or Veronique
for your clothes. Baptistin will tell you where, if you do not know
their address. The less pretension there is in your attire, the better
will be the effect, as you are a rich man. If you mean to buy any
horses, get them of Devedeux, and if you purchase a phaeton, go to
Baptiste for it."</p>

<p id="id05620">"At what hour shall we come?" asked the young man.</p>

<p id="id05621">"About half-past six."</p>

<p id="id05622">"We will be with you at that time," said the major. The two Cavalcanti
bowed to the count, and left the house. Monte Cristo went to the window,
and saw them crossing the street, arm in arm. "There go two miscreants;"
said he, "it is a pity they are not really related!"&#8212;then, after an
instant of gloomy reflection, "Come, I will go to see the Morrels," said
he; "I think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred."</p>

<h3 id="id05623" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 57. In the Lucerne Patch.</h3>

<p id="id05624">Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure
surrounding M. de Villefort's house, and, behind the gate, half screened
from view by the large chestnut-trees, which on all sides spread their
luxuriant branches, we shall find some people of our acquaintance. This
time Maximilian was the first to arrive. He was intently watching for a
shadow to appear among the trees, and awaiting with anxiety the sound of
a light step on the gravel walk. At length, the long-desired sound was
heard, and instead of one figure, as he had expected, he perceived that
two were approaching him. The delay had been occasioned by a visit from
Madame Danglars and Eugenie, which had been prolonged beyond the time at
which Valentine was expected. That she might not appear to fail in her
promise to Maximilian, she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they
should take a walk in the garden, being anxious to show that the delay,
which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him, was not occasioned by
any neglect on her part. The young man, with the intuitive perception
of a lover, quickly understood the circumstances in which she was
involuntarily placed, and he was comforted. Besides, although she
avoided coming within speaking distance, Valentine arranged so that
Maximilian could see her pass and repass, and each time she went by, she
managed, unperceived by her companion, to cast an expressive look at
the young man, which seemed to say, "Have patience! You see it is not
my fault." And Maximilian was patient, and employed himself in mentally
contrasting the two girls,&#8212;one fair, with soft languishing eyes, a
figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow; the other a brunette,
with a fierce and haughty expression, and as straight as a poplar. It is
unnecessary to state that, in the eyes of the young man, Valentine did
not suffer by the contrast. In about half an hour the girls went away,
and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars' visit had at last
come to an end. In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the garden alone.
For fear that any one should be observing her return, she walked slowly;
and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate, she
seated herself on a bench, and, carefully casting her eyes around, to
convince herself that she was not watched, she presently arose, and
proceeded quickly to join Maximilian.</p>

<p id="id05625">"Good-evening, Valentine," said a well-known voice.</p>

<p id="id05626">"Good-evening, Maximilian; I know I have kept you waiting, but you saw
the cause of my delay."</p>

<p id="id05627">"Yes, I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars. I was not aware that you were
so intimate with her."</p>

<p id="id05628">"Who told you we were intimate, Maximilian?"</p>

<p id="id05629">"No one, but you appeared to be so. From the manner in which you walked
and talked together, one would have thought you were two school-girls
telling your secrets to each other."</p>

<p id="id05630">"We were having a confidential conversation," returned Valentine; "she
was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with M. de Morcerf; and
I, on the other hand, was confessing to her how wretched it made me to
think of marrying M. d'Epinay."</p>

<p id="id05631">"Dear Valentine!"</p>

<p id="id05632">"That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed
between me and Eugenie, as in speaking of the man whom I could not love,
my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were
fixed."</p>

<p id="id05633">"Ah, how good you are to say so, Valentine! You possess a quality which
can never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars. It is that indefinable charm
which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the
fruit, for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek."</p>

<p id="id05634">"It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light."</p>

<p id="id05635">"No, Valentine, I assure you such is not the case. I was observing you
both when you were walking in the garden, and, on my honor, without at
all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars, I cannot
understand how any man can really love her."</p>

<p id="id05636">"The fact is, Maximilian, that I was there, and my presence had the
effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison."</p>

<p id="id05637">"No; but tell me&#8212;it is a question of simple curiosity, and which was
suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle
Danglars"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05638">"I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say.
It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex,"
interrupted Valentine.</p>

<p id="id05639">"You cannot, at least, deny that you are very harsh judges of each
other."</p>

<p id="id05640">"If we are so, it is because we generally judge under the influence of
excitement. But return to your question."</p>

<p id="id05641">"Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M. de Morcerf
on account of loving another?"</p>

<p id="id05642">"I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugenie."</p>

<p id="id05643">"Yes, but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly
intimate; own, now, that you did question her on the subject. Ah, I see
you are smiling."</p>

<p id="id05644">"If you are already aware of the conversation that passed, the wooden
partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight
security."</p>

<p id="id05645">"Come, what did she say?"</p>

<p id="id05646">"She told me that she loved no one," said Valentine; "that she disliked
the idea of being married; that she would infinitely prefer leading an
independent and unfettered life; and that she almost wished her father
might lose his fortune, that she might become an artist, like her
friend, Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly."</p>

<p id="id05647">"Ah, you see"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05648">"Well, what does that prove?" asked Valentine.</p>

<p id="id05649">"Nothing," replied Maximilian.</p>

<p id="id05650">"Then why did you smile?"</p>

<p id="id05651">"Why, you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself,<br>

Valentine."<br></p>

<p id="id05652">"Do you want me to go away?"</p>

<p id="id05653">"Ah, no, no. But do not let us lose time; you are the subject on which I
wish to speak."</p>

<p id="id05654">"True, we must be quick, for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass
together."</p>

<p id="id05655">"Ma foi," said Maximilian, in consternation.</p>

<p id="id05656">"Yes, you are right; I am but a poor friend to you. What a life I
cause you to lead, poor Maximilian, you who are formed for happiness! I
bitterly reproach myself, I assure you."</p>

<p id="id05657">"Well, what does it signify, Valentine, so long as I am satisfied, and
feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five
minutes of your society, or two words from your lips? And I have also
a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts,
harmonizing as ours do, and almost miraculously brought us together, to
separate us at last."</p>

<p id="id05658">"Those are kind and cheering words. You must hope for us both,<br>

Maximilian; that will make me at least partly happy."<br></p>

<p id="id05659">"But why must you leave me so soon?"</p>

<p id="id05660">"I do not know particulars. I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort
sent to request my presence, as she had a communication to make on which
a part of my fortune depended. Let them take my fortune, I am already
too rich; and, perhaps, when they have taken it, they will leave me in
peace and quietness. You would love me as much if I were poor, would you
not, Maximilian?"</p>

<p id="id05661">"Oh, I shall always love you. What should I care for either riches or
poverty, if my Valentine was near me, and I felt certain that no one
could deprive me of her? But do you not fear that this communication may
relate to your marriage?"</p>

<p id="id05662">"I do not think that is the case."</p>

<p id="id05663">"However it may be, Valentine, you must not be alarmed. I assure you
that, as long as I live, I shall never love any one else!"</p>

<p id="id05664">"You think to reassure me when you say that, Maximilian."</p>

<p id="id05665">"Pardon me, you are right. I am a brute. But I was going to tell you
that I met M. de Morcerf the other day."</p>

<p id="id05666">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id05667">"Monsieur Franz is his friend, you know."</p>

<p id="id05668">"What then?"</p>

<p id="id05669">"Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz, announcing his
immediate return." Valentine turned pale, and leaned her hand against
the gate. "Ah heavens, if it were that! But no, the communication would
not come through Madame de Villefort."</p>

<p id="id05670">"Why not?"</p>

<p id="id05671">"Because&#8212;I scarcely know why&#8212;but it has appeared as if Madame de
Villefort secretly objected to the marriage, although she did not choose
openly to oppose it."</p>

<p id="id05672">"Is it so? Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort."</p>

<p id="id05673">"Do not be in such a hurry to do that," said Valentine, with a sad
smile.</p>

<p id="id05674">"If she objects to your marrying M. d'Epinay, she would be all the more
likely to listen to any other proposition."</p>

<p id="id05675">"No, Maximilian, it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects,
it is marriage itself."</p>

<p id="id05676">"Marriage? If she dislikes that so much, why did she ever marry
herself?"</p>

<p id="id05677">"You do not understand me, Maximilian. About a year ago, I talked of
retiring to a convent. Madame de Villefort, in spite of all the remarks
which she considered it her duty to make, secretly approved of the
proposition, my father consented to it at her instigation, and it was
only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the
project. You can form no idea of the expression of that old man's eye
when he looks at me, the only person in the world whom he loves, and,
I had almost said, by whom he is beloved in return. When he learned my
resolution, I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast
on me, and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his
lifeless cheeks. Ah, Maximilian, I experienced, at that moment,
such remorse for my intention, that, throwing myself at his feet, I
exclaimed,&#8212;'Forgive me, pray forgive me, my dear grandfather; they may
do what they will with me, I will never leave you.' When I had ceased
speaking, he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven, but without uttering
a word. Ah, Maximilian, I may have much to suffer, but I feel as if my
grandfather's look at that moment would more than compensate for all."</p>

<p id="id05678">"Dear Valentine, you are a perfect angel, and I am sure I do not know
what I&#8212;sabring right and left among the Bedouins&#8212;can have done to
merit your being revealed to me, unless, indeed, heaven took into
consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels. But
tell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining
unmarried?"</p>

<p id="id05679">"Did I not tell you just now that I was rich, Maximilian&#8212;too rich? I
possess nearly 50,000 livres in right of my mother; my grandfather and
my grandmother, the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Meran, will leave
me as much, and M. Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir. My
brother Edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore,
be poor in comparison with me. Now, if I had taken the veil, all this
fortune would have descended to my father, and, in reversion, to his
son."</p>

<p id="id05680">"Ah, how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should
be so avaricious."</p>

<p id="id05681">"It is not for herself that she is so, but for her son, and what you
regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of
maternal love."</p>

<p id="id05682">"But could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your
fortune to her son?"</p>

<p id="id05683">"How could I make such a proposition, especially to a woman who always
professes to be so entirely disinterested?"</p>

<p id="id05684">"Valentine, I have always regarded our love in the light of something
sacred; consequently, I have covered it with the veil of respect, and
hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul. No human being, not even my
sister, is aware of its existence. Valentine, will you permit me to make
a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you?"</p>

<p id="id05685">Valentine started. "A friend, Maximilian; and who is this friend? I
tremble to give my permission."</p>

<p id="id05686">"Listen, Valentine. Have you never experienced for any one that sudden
and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had
been your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the first
time you had ever met? Nay, further, have you never endeavored to recall
the time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse, and
failing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits must
have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to
the present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the
past?"</p>

<p id="id05687">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05688">"Well, that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first
saw that extraordinary man."</p>

<p id="id05689">"Extraordinary, did you say?"</p>

<p id="id05690">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05691">"You have known him for some time, then?"</p>

<p id="id05692">"Scarcely longer than eight or ten days."</p>

<p id="id05693">"And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight
or ten days? Ah, Maximilian, I had hoped you set a higher value on the
title of friend."</p>

<p id="id05694">"Your logic is most powerful, Valentine, but say what you will, I can
never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession
of my mind. I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be
associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me,
and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to
come, and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according
to his own will."</p>

<p id="id05695">"He must be a prophet, then," said Valentine, smiling.</p>

<p id="id05696">"Indeed," said Maximilian, "I have often been almost tempted to
attribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events, he has a wonderful
power of foretelling any future good."</p>

<p id="id05697">"Ah," said Valentine in a mournful tone, "do let me see this man,
Maximilian; he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to
make amends for all I have suffered."</p>

<p id="id05698">"My poor girl, you know him already."</p>

<p id="id05699">"I know him?"</p>

<p id="id05700">"Yes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son."</p>

<p id="id05701">"The Count of Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id05702">"The same."</p>

<p id="id05703">"Ah," cried Valentine, "he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort
ever to be mine."</p>

<p id="id05704">"The friend of Madame de Villefort! It cannot be; surely, Valentine, you
are mistaken?"</p>

<p id="id05705">"No, indeed, I am not; for I assure you, his power over our household
is almost unlimited. Courted by my step-mother, who regards him as the
epitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has never
before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by
Edward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count's large black eyes,
runs to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he
is sure to find some delightful present,&#8212;M. de Monte Cristo appears
to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the
members of our family."</p>

<p id="id05706">"If such be the case, my dear Valentine, you must yourself have felt,
or at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence. He meets
Albert de Morcerf in Italy&#8212;it is to rescue him from the hands of the
banditti; he introduces himself to Madame Danglars&#8212;it is that he may
give her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before his
door&#8212;it is that his Nubian may save them from destruction. This man
evidently possesses the power of influencing events, both as regards
men and things. I never saw more simple tastes united to greater
magnificence. His smile is so sweet when he addresses me, that I forget
it ever can be bitter to others. Ah, Valentine, tell me, if he ever
looked on you with one of those sweet smiles? if so, depend on it, you
will be happy."</p>

<p id="id05707">"Me?" said the young girl, "he never even glances at me; on the
contrary, if I accidentally cross his path, he appears rather to avoid
me. Ah, he is not generous, neither does he possess that supernatural
penetration which you attribute to him, for if he did, he would have
perceived that I was unhappy; and if he had been generous, seeing me
sad and solitary, he would have used his influence to my advantage, and
since, as you say, he resembles the sun, he would have warmed my heart
with one of his life-giving rays. You say he loves you, Maximilian; how
do you know that he does? All would pay deference to an officer like
you, with a fierce mustache and a long sabre, but they think they may
crush a poor weeping girl with impunity."</p>

<p id="id05708">"Ah, Valentine, I assure you you are mistaken."</p>

<p id="id05709">"If it were otherwise&#8212;if he treated me diplomatically&#8212;that is to say,
like a man who wishes, by some means or other, to obtain a footing in
the house, so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its
occupants&#8212;he would, if it had been but once, have honored me with the
smile which you extol so loudly; but no, he saw that I was unhappy,
he understood that I could be of no use to him, and therefore paid no
attention to me whatever. Who knows but that, in order to please Madame
de Villefort and my father, he may not persecute me by every means in
his power? It is not just that he should despise me so, without any
reason. Ah, forgive me," said Valentine, perceiving the effect which her
words were producing on Maximilian: "I have done wrong, for I have given
utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know
existed in my heart. I do not deny the influence of which you speak,
or that I have not myself experienced it, but with me it has been
productive of evil rather than good."</p>

<p id="id05710">"Well, Valentine," said Morrel with a sigh, "we will not discuss the
matter further. I will not make a confidant of him."</p>

<p id="id05711">"Alas," said Valentine, "I see that I have given you pain. I can only
say how sincerely I ask pardon for having griefed you. But, indeed, I am
not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction. Tell me what this Count
of Monte Cristo has done for you."</p>

<p id="id05712">"I own that your question embarrasses me, Valentine, for I cannot say
that the count has rendered me any ostensible service. Still, as I have
already told you I have an instinctive affection for him, the source of
which I cannot explain to you. Has the sun done anything for me? No; he
warms me with his rays, and it is by his light that I see you&#8212;nothing
more. Has such and such a perfume done anything for me? No; its odor
charms one of my senses&#8212;that is all I can say when I am asked why I
praise it. My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as
his for me. A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be
something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship.
In his most simple actions, as well as in his most secret thoughts, I
find a relation to my own. You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you
that, ever since I have known this man, I have involuntarily entertained
the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated
from him. However, I have managed to live thirty years without this
protection, you will say; but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my
meaning. He invited me to dine with him on Saturday, which was a very
natural thing for him to do. Well, what have I learned since? That your
mother and M. de Villefort are both coming to this dinner. I shall meet
them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the
interview? This may appear to you to be no unusual combination of
circumstances; nevertheless, I perceive some hidden plot in the
arrangement&#8212;something, in fact, more than is apparent on a casual view
of the subject. I believe that this singular man, who appears to fathom
the motives of every one, has purposely arranged for me to meet M. and
Madame de Villefort, and sometimes, I confess, I have gone so far as to
try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of
our love."</p>

<p id="id05713">"My good friend," said Valentine, "I should take you for a visionary,
and should tremble for your reason, if I were always to hear you talk in
a strain similar to this. Is it possible that you can see anything
more than the merest chance in this meeting? Pray reflect a little.
My father, who never goes out, has several times been on the point
of refusing this invitation; Madame de Villefort, on the contrary, is
burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own
house, therefore, she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father
to accompany her. No, no; it is as I have said, Maximilian,&#8212;there is no
one in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my grandfather,
who is little better than a corpse."</p>

<p id="id05714">"I see that you are right, logically speaking," said Maximilian; "but
the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince
me to-day."</p>

<p id="id05715">"I feel the same as regards yourself." said Valentine; "and I own that,
if you have no stronger proof to give me"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05716">"I have another," replied Maximilian; "but I fear you will deem it even
more absurd than the first."</p>

<p id="id05717">"So much the worse," said Valentine, smiling.</p>

<p id="id05718">"It is, nevertheless, conclusive to my mind. My ten years of service
have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations, for
I have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed
me to move at once either to the right or to the left, in order to
escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side, while it
left me unharmed."</p>

<p id="id05719">"Dear Maximilian, why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers
for your safety? When you are away, I no longer pray for myself, but for
you."</p>

<p id="id05720">"Yes, since you have known me," said Morrel, smiling; "but that cannot
apply to the time previous to our acquaintance, Valentine."</p>

<p id="id05721">"You are very provoking, and will not give me credit for anything; but
let me hear this second proof, which you yourself own to be absurd."</p>

<p id="id05722">"Well, look through this opening, and you will see the beautiful new
horse which I rode here."</p>

<p id="id05723">"Ah, what a beautiful creature!" cried Valentine; "why did you not bring
him close to the gate, so that I could talk to him and pat him?"</p>

<p id="id05724">"He is, as you see, a very valuable animal," said Maximilian. "You know
that my means are limited, and that I am what would be designated a man
of moderate pretensions. Well, I went to a horse dealer's, where I saw
this magnificent horse, which I have named Medeah. I asked the price;
they told me it was 4,500 francs. I was, therefore, obliged to give it
up, as you may imagine, but I own I went away with rather a heavy heart,
for the horse had looked at me affectionately, had rubbed his head
against me and, when I mounted him, had pranced in the most delightful
way imaginable, so that I was altogether fascinated with him. The same
evening some friends of mine visited me,&#8212;M. de Chateau-Renaud, M.
Debray, and five or six other choice spirits, whom you do not know, even
by name. They proposed a game of bouillotte. I never play, for I am not
rich enough to afford to lose, or sufficiently poor to desire to gain.
But I was at my own house, you understand, so there was nothing to be
done but to send for the cards, which I did.</p>

<p id="id05725">"Just as they were sitting down to table, M. de Monte Cristo arrived. He
took his seat amongst them; they played, and I won. I am almost ashamed
to say that my gains amounted to 5,000 francs. We separated at midnight.
I could not defer my pleasure, so I took a cabriolet and drove to the
horse dealer's. Feverish and excited, I rang at the door. The person who
opened it must have taken me for a madman, for I rushed at once to the
stable. Medeah was standing at the rack, eating his hay. I immediately
put on the saddle and bridle, to which operation he lent himself with
the best grace possible; then, putting the 4,500 francs into the hands
of the astonished dealer, I proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing
the night in riding in the Champs Elysees. As I rode by the count's
house I perceived a light in one of the windows, and fancied I saw the
shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain. Now, Valentine, I firmly
believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse, and that he lost
expressly to give me the means of procuring him."</p>

<p id="id05726">"My dear Maximilian, you are really too fanciful; you will not love even
me long. A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry
and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common,
every-day sort of attachment such as ours. But they are calling me. Do
you hear?"</p>

<p id="id05727">"Ah, Valentine," said Maximilian, "give me but one finger through this
opening in the grating, one finger, the littlest finger of all, that I
may have the happiness of kissing it."</p>

<p id="id05728">"Maximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two
shadows."</p>

<p id="id05729">"As you will, Valentine."</p>

<p id="id05730">"Shall you be happy if I do what you wish?"</p>

<p id="id05731">"Oh, yes!" Valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger
but her whole hand through the opening. Maximilian uttered a cry of
delight, and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him,
and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. The little hand was
then immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw Valentine hurrying
towards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own
sensations.</p>

<h3 id="id05732" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort.</h3>

<p id="id05733">We will now relate what was passing in the house of the king's attorney
after the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the
time of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we have
just detailed. M. de Villefort entered his father's room, followed by
Madame de Villefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man
and speaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five
years in his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.</p>

<p id="id05734">M. Noirtier was sitting in an arm-chair, which moved upon casters, in
which he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way
drawn out again at night. He was placed before a large glass, which
reflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move,
which would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room
and everything which was going on around him. M. Noirtier, although
almost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick
and intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious
courtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official
character. Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they,
like two solitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which
seemed fit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of
one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that
still occupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his
inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees
by night across some desert place, and knows that a living being dwells
beyond the silence and obscurity. Noirtier's hair was long and white,
and flowed over his shoulders; while in his eyes, shaded by thick black
lashes, was concentrated, as it often happens with an organ which is
used to the exclusion of the others, all the activity, address, force,
and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body; and
so although the movement of the arm, the sound of the voice, and the
agility of the body, were wanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all.
He commanded with it; it was the medium through which his thanks were
conveyed. In short, his whole appearance produced on the mind the
impression of a corpse with living eyes, and nothing could be more
startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly
lighting up these organs, while the rest of the rigid and marble-like
features were utterly deprived of the power of participation. Three
persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic; these
were Villefort, Valentine, and the old servant of whom we have already
spoken. But as Villefort saw his father but seldom, and then only when
absolutely obliged, and as he never took any pains to please or gratify
him when he was there, all the old man's happiness was centred in his
granddaughter. Valentine, by means of her love, her patience, and her
devotion, had learned to read in Noirtier's look all the varied feelings
which were passing in his mind. To this dumb language, which was so
unintelligible to others, she answered by throwing her whole soul
into the expression of her countenance, and in this manner were the
conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless
invalid, whose body could scarcely be called a living one, but who,
nevertheless, possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration, united with
a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly
incapable of obeying its impulses. Valentine had solved the problem,
and was able easily to understand his thoughts, and to convey her own in
return, and, through her untiring and devoted assiduity, it was seldom
that, in the ordinary transactions of every-day life, she failed to
anticipate the wishes of the living, thinking mind, or the wants of the
almost inanimate body. As to the servant, he had, as we have said, been
with his master for five and twenty years, therefore he knew all his
habits, and it was seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for
anything, so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of
the invalid. Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the
domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation
which he was about to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood
the old man's vocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it
was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing. He
therefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,
and after having seated himself at his father's right hand, while Madame
de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05735">"I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come
with us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one
which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.
Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you."</p>

<p id="id05736">Noirtier's face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,
while, on the contrary, Villefort's eye was endeavoring to penetrate
into the inmost recesses of the old man's heart.</p>

<p id="id05737">"This communication," continued the procureur, in that cold and decisive
tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, "will, we are
sure, meet with your approbation." The eye of the invalid still retained
that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any
knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind; he listened,
nothing more. "Sir," resumed Villefort, "we are thinking of marrying
Valentine." Had the old man's face been moulded in wax it could not have
shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there. "The
marriage will take place in less than three months," said Villefort.
Noirtier's eye still retained its inanimate expression.</p>

<p id="id05738">Madame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and
added,&#8212;"We thought this news would possess an interest for you,
sir, who have always entertained a great affection for Valentine; it
therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man
for whom she is destined. It is one of the most desirable connections
which could possibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in
society, and every personal qualification likely to render Valentine
supremely happy,&#8212;his name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you.
It is M. Franz de Quesnel, Baron d'Epinay."</p>

<p id="id05739">While his wife was speaking, Villefort had narrowly watched the old
man's countenance. When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of
Franz, the pupil of M. Noirtier's eye began to dilate, and his eyelids
trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an
individual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame
de Villefort and his son. The procureur, who knew the political hatred
which had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d'Epinay,
well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had
produced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed
the narrative begun by his wife. "Sir," said he, "you are aware that
Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year, which renders it
important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance.
Nevertheless, you have not been forgotten in our plans, and we have
fully ascertained beforehand that Valentine's future husband will
consent, not to live in this house, for that might not be pleasant for
the young people, but that you should live with them; so that you and
Valentine, who are so attached to each other, would not be separated,
and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which
you have hitherto done, and thus, instead of losing, you will be a
gainer by the change, as it will secure to you two children instead of
one, to watch over and comfort you."</p>

<p id="id05740">Noirtier's look was furious; it was very evident that something
desperate was passing in the old man's mind, for a cry of anger and
grief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance,
appeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple
with the struggle. Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, "It is
very warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier." He then returned to his
place, but did not sit down. "This marriage," added Madame de Villefort,
"is quite agreeable to the wishes of M. d'Epinay and his family;
besides, he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother
having died at his birth, and his father having been assassinated
in 1815, that is to say, when he was but two years old; it naturally
followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits, and he
has, therefore, seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his
own will."</p>

<p id="id05741">"That assassination was a mysterious affair," said Villefort, "and the
perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has
fallen on the head of more than one person." Noirtier made such an
effort that his lips expanded into a smile.</p>

<p id="id05742">"Now," continued Villefort, "those to whom the guilt really belongs,
by whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may
probably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter,
would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such
a peace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so
ruthlessly destroyed." Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion
more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and
shattered frame. "Yes, I understand," was the reply contained in his
look; and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed
with profound contempt. Villefort fully understood his father's meaning,
and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his
wife to take leave. "Now sir," said Madame de Villefort, "I must bid you
farewell. Would you like me to send Edward to you for a short time?"</p>

<p id="id05743">It had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by
closing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he
had some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If
he wanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the
left. At Madame de Villefort's proposition he instantly winked his eyes.
Provoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, "Then shall
I send Valentine to you?" The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby
intimating that such was his wish. M. and Madame de Villefort bowed and
left the room, giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her
grandfather's presence, and feeling sure that she would have much to do
to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine,
with a color still heightened by emotion, entered the room just after
her parents had quitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her
grandfather was suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he
was wishing to communicate to her. "Dear grandpapa," cried she, "what
has happened? They have vexed you, and you are angry?" The paralytic
closed his eyes in token of assent. "Who has displeased you? Is it my
father?"</p>

<p id="id05744">"No."</p>

<p id="id05745">"Madame de Villefort?"</p>

<p id="id05746">"No."</p>

<p id="id05747">"Me?" The former sign was repeated. "Are you displeased with me?" cried<br>

Valentine in astonishment. M. Noirtier again closed his eyes. "And what<br>

have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with me?" cried<br>

Valentine.<br></p>

<p id="id05748">There was no answer, and she continued. "I have not seen you all day.<br>

Has any one been speaking to you against me?"<br></p>

<p id="id05749">"Yes," said the old man's look, with eagerness.</p>

<p id="id05750">"Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa&#8212;Ah&#8212;M. and Madame de<br>

Villefort have just left this room, have they not?"<br></p>

<p id="id05751">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05752">"And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What
was it then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of
making my peace with you?"</p>

<p id="id05753">"No, no," said Noirtier's look.</p>

<p id="id05754">"Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?" and she again tried to
think what it could be.</p>

<p id="id05755">"Ah, I know," said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old
man. "They have been speaking of my marriage,&#8212;have they not?"</p>

<p id="id05756">"Yes," replied the angry look.</p>

<p id="id05757">"I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the
subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping the
matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They did
not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered them
by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear grandpapa.
Pray forgive me." But there was no look calculated to reassure her; all
it seemed to say was, "It is not only your reserve which afflicts me."</p>

<p id="id05758">"What is it, then?" asked the young girl. "Perhaps you think I shall
abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am
married?"</p>

<p id="id05759">"No."</p>

<p id="id05760">"They told you, then, that M. d'Epinay consented to our all living
together?"</p>

<p id="id05761">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05762">"Then why are you still vexed and grieved?" The old man's eyes beamed
with an expression of gentle affection. "Yes, I understand," said
Valentine; "it is because you love me." The old man assented. "And you
are afraid I shall be unhappy?"</p>

<p id="id05763">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05764">"You do not like M. Franz?" The eyes repeated several times, "No, no,
no."</p>

<p id="id05765">"Then you are vexed with the engagement?"</p>

<p id="id05766">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05767">"Well, listen," said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and
putting her arm round her grandfather's neck, "I am vexed, too, for I do
not love M. Franz d'Epinay." An expression of intense joy illumined the
old man's eyes. "When I wished to retire into a convent, you remember
how angry you were with me?" A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid.
"Well," continued Valentine, "the reason of my proposing it was that
I might escape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair."
Noirtier's breathing came thick and short. "Then the idea of this
marriage really grieves you too? Ah, if you could but help me&#8212;if we
could both together defeat their plan! But you are unable to oppose
them,&#8212;you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will is so firm are
nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as I am myself. Alas,
you, who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days
of your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my joys and
sorrows, without being able to take any active part in them. However,
this is much, and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all
my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness."</p>

<p id="id05768">At these words there appeared in Noirtier's eye an expression of such
deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words
there: "You are mistaken; I can still do much for you."</p>

<p id="id05769">"Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?" said Valentine.</p>

<p id="id05770">"Yes." Noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on between him
and Valentine when he wanted anything.</p>

<p id="id05771">"What is it you want, dear grandpapa?" said Valentine, and she
endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to
need; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated
them aloud, then,&#8212;finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a
constant "No,"&#8212;she said, "Come, since this plan does not answer, I
will have recourse to another." She then recited all the letters of the
alphabet from A down to N. When she arrived at that letter the paralytic
made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing
he wanted. "Ah," said Valentine, "the thing you desire begins with the
letter N; it is with N that we have to do, then. Well, let me see, what
can you want that begins with N? Na&#8212;Ne&#8212;Ni&#8212;No"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05772">"Yes, yes, yes," said the old man's eye.</p>

<p id="id05773">"Ah, it is No, then?"</p>

<p id="id05774">"Yes." Valentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a desk
before Noirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the odd man's eye was
thoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and down
the columns. During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first
fell into this sad state, Valentine's powers of invention had been too
often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients
for gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had
so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man's meaning as
quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted. At
the word "Notary," Noirtier made a sign to her to stop. "Notary," said
she, "do you want a notary, dear grandpapa?" The old man again signified
that it was a notary he desired.</p>

<p id="id05775">"You would wish a notary to be sent for then?" said Valentine.</p>

<p id="id05776">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05777">"Shall my father be informed of your wish?"</p>

<p id="id05778">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05779">"Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?"</p>

<p id="id05780">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05781">"Then they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa. Is that all you
want?"</p>

<p id="id05782">"Yes." Valentine rang the bell, and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur
or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M. Noirtier's
room. "Are you satisfied now?" inquired Valentine.</p>

<p id="id05783">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05784">"I am sure you are; it is not very difficult to discover that,"&#8212;and the
young girl smiled on her grandfather, as if he had been a child. M. de
Villefort entered, followed by Barrois. "What do you want me for, sir?"
demanded he of the paralytic.</p>

<p id="id05785">"Sir," said Valentine, "my grandfather wishes for a notary." At this
strange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and his father exchanged
looks. "Yes," motioned the latter, with a firmness which seemed to
declare that with the help of Valentine and his old servant, who
both knew what his wishes were, he was quite prepared to maintain the
contest. "Do you wish for a notary?" asked Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05786">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05787">"What to do?"</p>

<p id="id05788">Noirtier made no answer. "What do you want with a notary?" again
repeated Villefort. The invalid's eye remained fixed, by which
expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable.
"Is it to do us some ill turn? Do you think it is worth while?" said
Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05789">"Still," said Barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant,
"if M. Noirtier asks for a notary, I suppose he really wishes for
a notary; therefore I shall go at once and fetch one." Barrois
acknowledged no master but Noirtier, and never allowed his desires in
any way to be contradicted.</p>

<p id="id05790">"Yes, I do want a notary," motioned the old man, shutting his eyes with
a look of defiance, which seemed to say, "and I should like to see the
person who dares to refuse my request."</p>

<p id="id05791">"You shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir," said
Villefort; "but I shall explain to him your state of health, and make
excuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous
one."</p>

<p id="id05792">"Never mind that," said Barrois; "I shall go and fetch a notary,
nevertheless,"&#8212;and the old servant departed triumphantly on his
mission.</p>

<h3 id="id05793" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 59. The Will.</h3>

<p id="id05794">As soon as Barrois had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with
a malicious expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly
understood the look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became
clouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily. He took a seat, and
quietly awaited the arrival of the notary. Noirtier saw him seat himself
with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time giving a
side look at Valentine, which made her understand that she also was to
remain in the room. Three-quarters of an hour after, Barrois returned,
bringing the notary with him. "Sir," said Villefort, after the first
salutations were over, "you were sent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see
here. All his limbs have become completely paralysed, he has lost his
voice also, and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch
some fragments of his meaning." Noirtier cast an appealing look on
Valentine, which look was at once so earnest and imperative, that
she answered immediately. "Sir," said she, "I perfectly understand my
grandfather's meaning at all times."</p>

<p id="id05795">"That is quite true," said Barrois; "and that is what I told the
gentleman as we walked along."</p>

<p id="id05796">"Permit me," said the notary, turning first to Villefort and then to
Valentine&#8212;"permit me to state that the case in question is just one
of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act
without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. The first
thing necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be
thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and
wishes of the person dictating the act. Now I cannot be sure of the
approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the
object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to
me, on account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite
useless, and cannot be legally exercised." The notary then prepared to
retire. An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of
the procureur. Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full
of grief, that she arrested the departure of the notary. "Sir," said
she, "the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily
learnt, and I can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it almost as
well as I can myself. Will you tell me what you require, in order to set
your conscience quite at ease on the subject?"</p>

<p id="id05797">"In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the approbation
or disapprobation of my client. Illness of body would not affect the
validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite."</p>

<p id="id05798">"Well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you
presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather
is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. M.
Noirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey
his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify 'yes,' and
to wink when he means 'no.' You now know quite enough to enable you to
converse with M. Noirtier;&#8212;try." Noirtier gave Valentine such a look
of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary
himself. "You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been
saying, sir, have you?" asked the notary. Noirtier closed his eyes. "And
you approve of what she said&#8212;that is to say, you declare that the
signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are
accustomed to convey your thoughts?"</p>

<p id="id05799">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05800">"It was you who sent for me?"</p>

<p id="id05801">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05802">"To make your will?"</p>

<p id="id05803">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05804">"And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original
intentions?" The old man winked violently. "Well, sir," said the young
girl, "do you understand now, and is your conscience perfectly at rest
on the subject?" But before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn
him aside. "Sir," said he, "do you suppose for a moment that a man can
sustain a physical shock, such as M. Noirtier has received, without any
detriment to his mental faculties?"</p>

<p id="id05805">"It is not exactly that, sir," said the notary, "which makes me uneasy,
but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so as
to be able to get his answers."</p>

<p id="id05806">"You must see that to be an utter impossibility," said Villefort.
Valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed
his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the
look.</p>

<p id="id05807">"Sir," said she, "that need not make you uneasy, however difficult it
may at first sight appear to be. I can discover and explain to you my
grandfather's thoughts, so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears
on the subject. I have now been six years with M. Noirtier, and let him
tell you if ever once, during that time, he has entertained a thought
which he was unable to make me understand."</p>

<p id="id05808">"No," signed the old man.</p>

<p id="id05809">"Let us try what we can do, then," said the notary. "You accept this
young lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?"</p>

<p id="id05810">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05811">"Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you
wish to be drawn up?" Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet
until she came to W. At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave
her notice that she was to stop. "It is very evident that it is the
letter W which M. Noirtier wants," said the notary. "Wait,"
said Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated,
"Wa&#8212;We&#8212;Wi"&#8212;The old man stopped her at the last syllable. Valentine
then took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned
over the pages. She passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when
she came to the word "Will," M. Noirtier's eye bade her stop. "Will,"
said the notary; "it is very evident that M. Noirtier is desirous of
making his will."</p>

<p id="id05812">"Yes, yes, yes," motioned the invalid.</p>

<p id="id05813">"Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary," said
the astonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort. "Yes," said the
procureur, "and I think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary,
for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of
Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too much interested in
its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure
and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather."</p>

<p id="id05814">"No, no, no," replied the eye of the paralytic.</p>

<p id="id05815">"What?" said Villefort, "do you mean to say that Valentine is not
interested in your will?"</p>

<p id="id05816">"No."</p>

<p id="id05817">"Sir," said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and
who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this
extraordinary and picturesque scene, "what appeared so impossible to me
an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may
be a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven
witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the
presence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not require very much
more than the generality of wills. There are certain forms necessary to
be gone through, and which are always the same. As to the details, the
greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we
find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having had the
management of them, can doubtless give full information on the subject.
But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be contested,
I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity, therefore,
one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom, will assist
in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?" continued
the notary, addressing the old man.</p>

<p id="id05818">"Yes," looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready
interpretation of his meaning.</p>

<p id="id05819">"What is he going to do?" thought Villefort, whose position demanded
much reserve, but who was longing to know what his father's intentions
were. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent, but
Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master's wishes,
and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his wife to
come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour every one had assembled
in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also arrived. A
few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers
of the law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will, in order
to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally
couched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator, the first
notary said, turning towards him,&#8212;"When an individual makes his will,
it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person."</p>

<p id="id05820">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05821">"Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?"</p>

<p id="id05822">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05823">"I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you
will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own
possessions?"</p>

<p id="id05824">"Yes." There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. Never had
the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and
if it was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle. They had
formed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a
table, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the
testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have
alluded. "Your fortune exceeds 300,000. francs, does it not?" asked
he. Noirtier made a sign that it did. "Do you possess 400,000 francs?"
inquired the notary. Noirtier's eye remained immovable. "Five
hundred thousand?" The same expression continued. "Six hundred
thousand&#8212;700,000&#8212;800,000&#8212;900,000?" Noirtier stopped him at the
last-named sum. "You are then in possession of 900,000. francs?" asked
the notary. "Yes."</p>

<p id="id05825">"In landed property?"</p>

<p id="id05826">"No."</p>

<p id="id05827">"In stock?"</p>

<p id="id05828">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05829">"The stock is in your own hands?" The look which M. Noirtier cast on
Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to
find. The old servant left the room, and presently returned, bringing
with him a small casket. "Do you permit us to open this casket?" asked
the notary. Noirtier gave his assent. They opened it, and found 900,000.
francs in bank scrip. The first notary handed over each note, as he
examined it, to his colleague.</p>

<p id="id05830">The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated. "It is all
as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full
force and vigor." Then, turning towards the paralytic, he said, "You
possess, then, 900,000. francs of capital, which, according to the
manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income of
about 40,000 livres?"</p>

<p id="id05831">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05832">"To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?"</p>

<p id="id05833">"Oh," said Madame de Villefort, "there is not much doubt on that
subject. M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter, Mademoiselle de
Villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years, and
has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I had almost
said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that she
should reap the fruit of her devotion." The eye of Noirtier clearly
showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent
given by Madame de Villefort's words and manner to the motives which she
supposed him to entertain. "Is it, then, to Mademoiselle Valentine de
Villefort that you leave these 900,000 francs?" demanded the notary,
thinking he had only to insert this clause, but waiting first for the
assent of Noirtier, which it was necessary should be given before all
the witnesses of this singular scene. Valentine, when her name was
made the subject of discussion, had stepped back, to escape unpleasant
observation; her eyes were cast down, and she was crying. The old
man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest
tenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he significantly winked
his eye in token of dissent.</p>
