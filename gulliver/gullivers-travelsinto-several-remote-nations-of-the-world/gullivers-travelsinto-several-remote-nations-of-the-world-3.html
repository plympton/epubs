<p>I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to inform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would be diverting to her majesty.&#160; The girl, who had been out of order, was carried by her governess to take the air about an hour&#8217;s distance, or thirty miles from town.&#160; They alighted out of the coach near a small foot-path in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box, I went out of it to walk.&#160; There was a cow-dung in the path, and I must need try my activity by attempting to leap over it.&#160; I took a run, but unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to my knees.&#160; I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was filthily bemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home; where the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it about the court: so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense.</p>
<h3 id="dlepubid00018">CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen.&#160; He shows his skill in music.&#160; The king inquires into the state of England, which the author relates to him.&#160; The king&#8217;s observations thereon.</p>
<p>I used to attend the king&#8217;s levee once or twice a week, and had often seen him under the barber&#8217;s hand, which indeed was at first very terrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.&#160; His majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved twice a-week.&#160; I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps of hair.&#160; I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a comb, making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a needle as I could get from Glumdalclitch.&#160; I fixed in the stumps so artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points, that I made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own being so much broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither did I know any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would undertake to make me another.</p>
<p>And this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein I spent many of my leisure hours.&#160; I desired the queen&#8217;s woman to save for me the combings of her majesty&#8217;s hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two chair-frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and to bore little holes with a fine awl, round those parts where I designed the backs and seats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out, just after the manner of cane chairs in England.&#160; When they were finished, I made a present of them to her majesty; who kept them in her cabinet, and used to show them for curiosities, as indeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them.&#160; The queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs, but I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die than place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs, that once adorned her majesty&#8217;s head.&#160; Of these hairs (as I had always a mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little purse, about five feet long, with her majesty&#8217;s name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave to Glumdalclitch, by the queen&#8217;s consent.&#160; To say the truth, it was more for show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that girls are fond of.</p>
<p>The king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them: but the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the tunes.&#160; I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it.&#160; My practice was to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window curtains; after which I found their music not disagreeable.</p>
<p>I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.&#160; Glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a-week to teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that instrument, and was played upon in the same manner.&#160; A fancy came into my head, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English tune upon this instrument.&#160; But this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with my arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great a labour, and to no purpose.&#160; The method I contrived was this: I prepared two round sticks, about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker at one end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with pieces of a mouse&#8217;s skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the tops of the keys nor interrupt the sound.&#160; Before the spinet a bench was placed, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench.&#160; I ran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the great satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent exercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys, nor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do; which was a great disadvantage to my performance.</p>
<p>The king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my box, and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his face.&#160; In this manner I had several conversations with him.&#160; I one day took the freedom to tell his majesty, &#8220;that the contempt he discovered towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed in our country, that the tallest persons were usually the least provided with it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of more industry, art, and sagacity, than many of the larger kinds; and that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do his majesty some signal service.&#8221;&#160; The king heard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before.&#160; He desired &#8220;I would give him as exact an account of the government of England as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the tongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits and felicity.</p>
<p>I began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under one sovereign, beside our plantations in America.&#160; I dwelt long upon the fertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate.&#160; I then spoke at large upon the constitution of an English parliament; partly made up of an illustrious body called the House of Peers; persons of the noblest blood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies.&#160; I described that extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms, to qualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom; to have a share in the legislature; to be members of the highest court of judicature, whence there can be no appeal; and to be champions always ready for the defence of their prince and country, by their valour, conduct, and fidelity.&#160; That these were the ornament and bulwark of the kingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose honour had been the reward of their virtue, from which their posterity were never once known to degenerate.&#160; To these were joined several holy persons, as part of that assembly, under the title of bishops, whose peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct the people therein.&#160; These were searched and sought out through the whole nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors, among such of the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people.</p>
<p>That the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked and culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and love of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation.&#160; And that these two bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe; to whom, in conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is committed.</p>
<p>I then descended to the courts of justice; over which the judges, those venerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining the disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the punishment of vice and protection of innocence.&#160; I mentioned the prudent management of our treasury; the valour and achievements of our forces, by sea and land.&#160; I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how many millions there might be of each religious sect, or political party among us.&#160; I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other particular which I thought might redound to the honour of my country.&#160; And I finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in England for about a hundred years past.</p>
<p>This conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several hours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently taking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of what questions he intended to ask me.</p>
<p>When I had put an end to these long discources, his majesty, in a sixth audience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and objections, upon every article.&#160; He asked, &#8220;What methods were used to cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind of business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their lives?&#160; What course was taken to supply that assembly, when any noble family became extinct?&#160; What qualifications were necessary in those who are to be created new lords: whether the humour of the prince, a sum of money to a court lady, or a design of strengthening a party opposite to the public interest, ever happened to be the motive in those advancements?&#160; What share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of their country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to decide the properties of their fellow-subjects in the last resort?&#160; Whether they were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or some other sinister view, could have no place among them?&#160; Whether those holy lords I spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of their knowledge in religious matters, and the sanctity of their lives; had never been compliers with the times, while they were common priests; or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman, whose opinions they continued servilely to follow, after they were admitted into that assembly?&#8221;</p>
<p>He then desired to know, &#8220;What arts were practised in electing those whom I called commoners: whether a stranger, with a strong purse, might not influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord, or the most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood?&#160; How it came to pass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly, which I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often to the ruin of their families, without any salary or pension? because this appeared such an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that his majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere.&#8221;&#160; And he desired to know, &#8220;Whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding themselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the public good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince, in conjunction with a corrupted ministry?&#8221;&#160; He multiplied his questions, and sifted me thoroughly upon every part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries and objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.</p>
<p>Upon what I said in relation to our courts of justice, his majesty desired to be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better able to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery, which was decreed for me with costs.&#160; He asked, &#8220;What time was usually spent in determining between right and wrong, and what degree of expense?&#160; Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive?&#160; Whether party, in religion or politics, were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice?&#160; Whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and other local customs?&#160; Whether they or their judges had any part in penning those laws, which they assumed the liberty of interpreting, and glossing upon at their pleasure?&#160; Whether they had ever, at different times, pleaded for and against the same cause, and cited precedents to prove contrary opinions?&#160; Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?&#160; Whether they received any pecuniary reward for pleading, or delivering their opinions?&#160; And particularly, whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower senate?&#8221;</p>
<p>He fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said, &#8220;he thought my memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or six millions a-year, and when I came to mention the issues, he found they sometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he had taken were very particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me, that the knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could not be deceived in his calculations.&#160; But, if what I told him were true, he was still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private person.&#8221;&#160; He asked me, &#8220;who were our creditors; and where we found money to pay them?&#8221;&#160; He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and expensive wars; &#8220;that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live among very bad neighbours, and that our generals must needs be richer than our kings.&#8221;&#160; He asked, what business we had out of our own islands, unless upon the score of trade, or treaty, or to defend the coasts with our fleet?&#8221;&#160; Above all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary standing army, in the midst of peace, and among a free people.&#160; He said, &#8220;if we were governed by our own consent, in the persons of our representatives, he could not imagine of whom we were afraid, or against whom we were to fight; and would hear my opinion, whether a private man&#8217;s house might not be better defended by himself, his children, and family, than by half-a-dozen rascals, picked up at a venture in the streets for small wages, who might get a hundred times more by cutting their throats?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed at my &#8220;odd kind of arithmetic,&#8221; as he was pleased to call it, &#8220;in reckoning the numbers of our people, by a computation drawn from the several sects among us, in religion and politics.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;he knew no reason why those, who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public, should be obliged to change, or should not be obliged to conceal them.&#160; And as it was tyranny in any government to require the first, so it was weakness not to enforce the second: for a man may be allowed to keep poisons in his closet, but not to vend them about for cordials.&#8221;</p>
<p>He observed, &#8220;that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry, I had mentioned gaming: he desired to know at what age this entertainment was usually taken up, and when it was laid down; how much of their time it employed; whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes; whether mean, vicious people, by their dexterity in that art, might not arrive at great riches, and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence, as well as habituate them to vile companions, wholly take them from the improvement of their minds, and force them, by the losses they received, to learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon others?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of our affairs during the last century; protesting &#8220;it was only a heap of conspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments, the very worst effects that avarice, faction, hypocrisy, perfidiousness, cruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice, and ambition, could produce.&#8221;</p>
<p>His majesty, in another audience, was at the pains to recapitulate the sum of all I had spoken; compared the questions he made with the answers I had given; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me gently, delivered himself in these words, which I shall never forget, nor the manner he spoke them in: &#8220;My little friend Grildrig, you have made a most admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly proved, that ignorance, idleness, and vice, are the proper ingredients for qualifying a legislator; that laws are best explained, interpreted, and applied, by those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting, confounding, and eluding them.&#160; I observe among you some lines of an institution, which, in its original, might have been tolerable, but these half erased, and the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions.&#160; It does not appear, from all you have said, how any one perfection is required toward the procurement of any one station among you; much less, that men are ennobled on account of their virtue; that priests are advanced for their piety or learning; soldiers, for their conduct or valour; judges, for their integrity; senators, for the love of their country; or counsellors for their wisdom.&#160; As for yourself,&#8221; continued the king, &#8220;who have spent the greatest part of your life in travelling, I am well disposed to hope you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country.&#160; But by what I have gathered from your own relation, and the answers I have with much pains wrung and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<h3 id="dlepubid00019">CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The author&#8217;s love of his country.&#160; He makes a proposal of much advantage to the king, which is rejected.&#160; The king&#8217;s great ignorance in politics.&#160; The learning of that country very imperfect and confined.&#160; The laws, and military affairs, and parties in the state.</p>
<p>Nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from concealing this part of my story.&#160; It was in vain to discover my resentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was forced to rest with patience, while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously treated.&#160; I am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be, that such an occasion was given: but this prince happened to be so curious and inquisitive upon every particular, that it could not consist either with gratitude or good manners, to refuse giving him what satisfaction I was able.&#160; Yet thus much I may be allowed to say in my own vindication, that I artfully eluded many of his questions, and gave to every point a more favourable turn, by many degrees, than the strictness of truth would allow.&#160; For I have always borne that laudable partiality to my own country, which Dionysius Halicarnassensis, with so much justice, recommends to an historian: I would hide the frailties and deformities of my political mother, and place her virtues and beauties in the most advantageous light.&#160; This was my sincere endeavour in those many discourses I had with that monarch, although it unfortunately failed of success.</p>
<p>But great allowances should be given to a king, who lives wholly secluded from the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether unacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations: the want of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices, and a certain narrowness of thinking, from which we, and the politer countries of Europe, are wholly exempted.&#160; And it would be hard indeed, if so remote a prince&#8217;s notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard for all mankind.</p>
<p>To confirm what I have now said, and further to show the miserable effects of a confined education, I shall here insert a passage, which will hardly obtain belief.&#160; In hopes to ingratiate myself further into his majesty&#8217;s favour, I told him of &#8220;an invention, discovered between three and four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder, into a heap of which, the smallest spark of fire falling, would kindle the whole in a moment, although it were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up in the air together, with a noise and agitation greater than thunder.&#160; That a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or iron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead, with such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force.&#160; That the largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.&#160; That we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up the pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splinters on every side, dashing out the brains of all who came near.&#160; That I knew the ingredients very well, which were cheap and common; I understood the manner of compounding them, and could direct his workmen how to make those tubes, of a size proportionable to all other things in his majesty&#8217;s kingdom, and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long; twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged with the proper quantity of powder and balls, would batter down the walls of the strongest town in his dominions in a few hours, or destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it should pretend to dispute his absolute commands.&#8221;&#160; This I humbly offered to his majesty, as a small tribute of acknowledgment, in turn for so many marks that I had received, of his royal favour and protection.</p>
<p>The king was struck with horror at the description I had given of those terrible engines, and the proposal I had made.&#160; &#8220;He was amazed, how so impotent and grovelling an insect as I&#8221; (these were his expressions) &#8220;could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which I had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines; whereof,&#8221; he said, &#8220;some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been the first contriver.&#160; As for himself, he protested, that although few things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet he would rather lose half his kingdom, than be privy to such a secret; which he commanded me, as I valued any life, never to mention any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>A strange effect of narrow principles and views! that a prince possessed of every quality which procures veneration, love, and esteem; of strong parts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endowed with admirable talents, and almost adored by his subjects, should, from a nice, unnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we can have no conception, let slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his people!&#160; Neither do I say this, with the least intention to detract from the many virtues of that excellent king, whose character, I am sensible, will, on this account, be very much lessened in the opinion of an English reader: but I take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance, by not having hitherto reduced politics into a science, as the more acute wits of Europe have done.&#160; For, I remember very well, in a discourse one day with the king, when I happened to say, &#8220;there were several thousand books among us written upon the art of government,&#8221; it gave him (directly contrary to my intention) a very mean opinion of our understandings.&#160; He professed both to abominate and despise all mystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a minister.&#160; He could not tell what I meant by secrets of state, where an enemy, or some rival nation, were not in the case.&#160; He confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow bounds, to common sense and reason, to justice and lenity, to the speedy determination of civil and criminal causes; with some other obvious topics, which are not worth considering.&#160; And he gave it for his opinion, &#8220;that whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in morality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be allowed to excel.&#160; But the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful in life, to the improvement of agriculture, and all mechanical arts; so that among us, it would be little esteemed.&#160; And as to ideas, entities, abstractions, and transcendentals, I could never drive the least conception into their heads.</p>
<p>No law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters in their alphabet, which consists only of two and twenty.&#160; But indeed few of them extend even to that length.&#160; They are expressed in the most plain and simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough to discover above one interpretation: and to write a comment upon any law, is a capital crime.&#160; As to the decision of civil causes, or proceedings against criminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.</p>
<p>They have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time out of mind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king, which is reckoned the largest, does not amount to above a thousand volumes, placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence I had liberty to borrow what books I pleased.&#160; The queen&#8217;s joiner had contrived in one of Glumdalclitch&#8217;s rooms, a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were each fifty feet long.&#160; It was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the lowest end placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber.&#160; The book I had a mind to read, was put up leaning against the wall: I first mounted to the upper step of the ladder, and turning my face towards the book, began at the top of the page, and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten paces, according to the length of the lines, till I had gotten a little below the level of mine eyes, and then descending gradually till I came to the bottom: after which I mounted again, and began the other page in the same manner, and so turned over the leaf, which I could easily do with both my hands, for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long.</p>
<p>Their style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various expressions.&#160; I have perused many of their books, especially those in history and morality.&#160; Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch&#8217;s bed chamber, and belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in writings of morality and devotion.&#160; The book treats of the weakness of human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the vulgar.&#160; However, I was curious to see what an author of that country could say upon such a subject.&#160; This writer went through all the usual topics of European moralists, showing &#8220;how diminutive, contemptible, and helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend himself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how much he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed, by a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.&#8221;&#160; He added, &#8220;that nature was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient times.&#8221;&#160; He said &#8220;it was very reasonable to think, not only that the species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled race of men in our days.&#8221;&#160; He argued, &#8220;that the very laws of nature absolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size more large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.&#8221;&#160; From this way of reasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the conduct of life, but needless here to repeat.&#160; For my own part, I could not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining, from the quarrels we raise with nature.&#160; And I believe, upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they are among that people.</p>
<p>As to their military affairs, they boast that the king&#8217;s army consists of a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand horse: if that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in the several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only the nobility and gentry, without pay or reward.&#160; They are indeed perfect enough in their exercises, and under very good discipline, wherein I saw no great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where every farmer is under the command of his own landlord, and every citizen under that of the principal men in his own city, chosen after the manner of Venice, by ballot?</p>
<p>I have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise, in a great field near the city of twenty miles square.&#160; They were in all not above twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse; but it was impossible for me to compute their number, considering the space of ground they took up.&#160; A cavalier, mounted on a large steed, might be about ninety feet high.&#160; I have seen this whole body of horse, upon a word of command, draw their swords at once, and brandish them in the air.&#160; Imagination can figure nothing so grand, so surprising, and so astonishing! it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.</p>
<p>I was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is no access from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach his people the practice of military discipline.&#160; But I was soon informed, both by conversation and reading their histories; for, in the course of many ages, they have been troubled with the same disease to which the whole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often contending for power, the people for liberty, and the king for absolute dominion.&#160; All which, however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom, have been sometimes violated by each of the three parties, and have more than once occasioned civil wars; the last whereof was happily put an end to by this prince&#8217;s grand-father, in a general composition; and the militia, then settled with common consent, has been ever since kept in the strictest duty.</p>
<h3 id="dlepubid00020">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The king and queen make a progress to the frontiers.&#160; The author attends them.&#160; The manner in which he leaves the country very particularly related.&#160; He returns to England.</p>
<p>I had always a strong impulse that I should some time recover my liberty, though it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to form any project with the least hope of succeeding.&#160; The ship in which I sailed, was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast, and the king had given strict orders, that if at any time another appeared, it should be taken ashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought in a tumbril to Lorbrulgrud.&#160; He was strongly bent to get me a woman of my own size, by whom I might propagate the breed: but I think I should rather have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept in cages, like tame canary-birds, and perhaps, in time, sold about the kingdom, to persons of quality, for curiosities.&#160; I was indeed treated with much kindness: I was the favourite of a great king and queen, and the delight of the whole court; but it was upon such a foot as ill became the dignity of humankind.&#160; I could never forget those domestic pledges I had left behind me.&#160; I wanted to be among people, with whom I could converse upon even terms, and walk about the streets and fields without being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy.&#160; But my deliverance came sooner than I expected, and in a manner not very common; the whole story and circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.</p>
<p>I had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of the third, Glumdalclitch and I attended the king and queen, in a progress to the south coast of the kingdom.&#160; I was carried, as usual, in my travelling-box, which as I have already described, was a very convenient closet, of twelve feet wide.&#160; And I had ordered a hammock to be fixed, by silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a servant carried me before him on horseback, as I sometimes desired; and would often sleep in my hammock, while we were upon the road.&#160; On the roof of my closet, not directly over the middle of the hammock, I ordered the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot weather, as I slept; which hole I shut at pleasure with a board that drew backward and forward through a groove.</p>
<p>When we came to our journey&#8217;s end, the king thought proper to pass a few days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen English miles of the seaside.&#160; Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I had gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to her chamber.&#160; I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of my escape, if ever it should happen.&#160; I pretended to be worse than I really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a page, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with me.&#160; I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch consented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me, bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some forboding of what was to happen.&#160; The boy took me out in my box, about half an hours walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore.&#160; I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many a wistful melancholy look towards the sea.&#160; I found myself not very well, and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I hoped would do me good.&#160; I got in, and the boy shut the window close down, to keep out the cold.&#160; I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture is, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among the rocks to look for birds&#8217; eggs, having before observed him from my window searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.&#160; Be that as it will, I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage.&#160; I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne forward with prodigious speed.&#160; The first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock, but afterward the motion was easy enough.&#160; I called out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no purpose.&#160; I looked towards my windows, and could see nothing but the clouds and sky.&#160; I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of wings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I was in; that some eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it fall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body, and devour it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to discover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I could be within a two-inch board.</p>
<p>In a little time, I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase very fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign in a windy day.&#160; I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle (for such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his beak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling perpendicularly down, for above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I almost lost my breath.&#160; My fall was stopped by a terrible squash, that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I was quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise so high, that I could see light from the tops of the windows.&#160; I now perceived I was fallen into the sea.&#160; My box, by the weight of my body, the goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength at the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep in water.&#160; I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle which flew away with my box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me drop, while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to share in the prey.&#160; The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for those were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint of it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came in.&#160; I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured to draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on purpose to let in air, for want of which I found myself almost stifled.</p>
<p>How often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom one single hour had so far divided me!&#160; And I may say with truth, that in the midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my poor nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the queen, and the ruin of her fortune.&#160; Perhaps many travellers have not been under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this juncture, expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave.&#160; A breach in one single pane of glass would have been immediate death: nor could any thing have preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the outside, against accidents in travelling.&#160; I saw the water ooze in at several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I endeavoured to stop them as well as I could.&#160; I was not able to lift up the roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and sat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some hours longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold.&#160; Or if I escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a miserable death of cold and hunger?&#160; I was four hours under these circumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my last.</p>
<p>I have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed upon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant, who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle it about his waist.&#160; Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that the box was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving me almost in the dark.&#160; This gave me some faint hopes of relief, although I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about.&#160; I ventured to unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the floor; and having made a hard shift to screw it down again, directly under the slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a loud voice, and in all the languages I understood.&#160; I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near, the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.</p>
<p>I found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to be moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that side of the box where the staples were, and had no windows, struck against something that was hard.&#160; I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself tossed more than ever.&#160; I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet, like that of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed through the ring.&#160; I then found myself hoisted up, by degrees, at least three feet higher than I was before.&#160; Whereupon I again thrust up my stick and handkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse.&#160; In return to which, I heard a great shout repeated three times, giving me such transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them.&#160; I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through the hole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, &#8220;If there be any body below, let them speak.&#8221;&#160; I answered, &#8220;I was an Englishman, drawn by ill fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and begged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was in.&#8221;&#160; The voice replied, &#8220;I was safe, for my box was fastened to their ship; and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the cover, large enough to pull me out.&#8221;&#160; I answered, &#8220;that was needless, and would take up too much time; for there was no more to be done, but let one of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the sea into the ship, and so into the captain&#8217;s cabin.&#8221;&#160; Some of them, upon hearing me talk so wildly, thought I was mad: others laughed; for indeed it never came into my head, that I was now got among people of my own stature and strength.&#160; The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a passage about four feet square, then let down a small ladder, upon which I mounted, and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition.</p>
<p>The sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions, which I had no inclination to answer.&#160; I was equally confounded at the sight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to be, after having so long accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects I had left.&#160; But the captain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man, observing I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to comfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a little rest, of which I had great need.&#160; Before I went to sleep, I gave him to understand that I had some valuable furniture in my box, too good to be lost: a fine hammock, a handsome field-bed, two chairs, a table, and a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted, with silk and cotton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my closet into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and show him my goods.&#160; The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was raving; however (I suppose to pacify me) he promised to give order as I desired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet, whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my goods, and stripped off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being screwed to the floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen, who tore them up by force.&#160; Then they knocked off some of the boards for the use of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hull drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom and sides, sunk to rights.&#160; And, indeed, I was glad not to have been a spectator of the havoc they made, because I am confident it would have sensibly touched me, by bringing former passages into my mind, which I would rather have forgot.</p>
<p>I slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place I had left, and the dangers I had escaped.&#160; However, upon waking, I found myself much recovered.&#160; It was now about eight o&#8217;clock at night, and the captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already fasted too long.&#160; He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look wildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired I would give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident I came to be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest.&#160; He said &#8220;that about twelve o&#8217;clock at noon, as he was looking through his glass, he spied it at a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make, being not much out of his course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his own beginning to fall short.&#160; That upon coming nearer, and finding his error, he sent out his long-boat to discover what it was; that his men came back in a fright, swearing they had seen a swimming house.&#160; That he laughed at their folly, and went himself in the boat, ordering his men to take a strong cable along with them.&#160; That the weather being calm, he rowed round me several times, observed my windows and wire lattices that defended them.&#160; That he discovered two staples upon one side, which was all of boards, without any passage for light.&#160; He then commanded his men to row up to that side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples, ordered them to tow my chest, as they called it, toward the ship.&#160; When it was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring fixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulleys, which all the sailors were not able to do above two or three feet.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;they saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole, and concluded that some unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.&#8221;&#160; I asked, &#8220;whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air, about the time he first discovered me.&#8221;&#160; To which he answered, &#8220;that discoursing this matter with the sailors while I was asleep, one of them said, he had observed three eagles flying towards the north, but remarked nothing of their being larger than the usual size:&#8221; which I suppose must be imputed to the great height they were at; and he could not guess the reason of my question.&#160; I then asked the captain, &#8220;how far he reckoned we might be from land?&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;by the best computation he could make, we were at least a hundred leagues.&#8221;&#160; I assured him, &#8220;that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I had not left the country whence I came above two hours before I dropped into the sea.&#8221;&#160; Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed in a cabin he had provided.&#160; I assured him, &#8220;I was well refreshed with his good entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was in my life.&#8221;&#160; He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely, &#8220;whether I were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime, for which I was punished, at the command of some prince, by exposing me in that chest; as great criminals, in other countries, have been forced to sea in a leaky vessel, without provisions: for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship, yet he would engage his word to set me safe ashore, in the first port where we arrived.&#8221;&#160; He added, &#8220;that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd speeches I had delivered at first to his sailors, and afterwards to himself, in relation to my closet or chest, as well as by my odd looks and behaviour while I was at supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>I begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did, from the last time I left England, to the moment he first discovered me.&#160; And, as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this honest worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense, was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity.&#160; But further to confirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet should be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet.&#160; I opened it in his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made in the country from which I had been so strangely delivered.&#160; There was the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king&#8217;s beard, and another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty&#8217;s thumb-nail, which served for the back.&#160; There was a collection of needles and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like joiner&#8217;s tacks; some combings of the queen&#8217;s hair; a gold ring, which one day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar.&#160; I desired the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his civilities; which he absolutely refused.&#160; I showed him a corn that I had cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour&#8217;s toe; it was about the bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver.&#160; Lastly, I desired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a mouse&#8217;s skin.</p>
<p>I could force nothing on him but a footman&#8217;s tooth, which I observed him to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.&#160; He received it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could deserve.&#160; It was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of Glumdalclitch&#8217;s men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it was as sound as any in his head.&#160; I got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet.&#160; It was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.</p>
<p>The captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given him, and said, &#8220;he hoped, when we returned to England, I would oblige the world by putting it on paper, and making it public.&#8221;&#160; My answer was, &#8220;that we were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now pass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted some authors less consulted truth, than their own vanity, or interest, or the diversion of ignorant readers; that my story could contain little beside common events, without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees, birds, and other animals; or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of savage people, with which most writers abound.&#160; However, I thanked him for his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said &#8220;he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak so loud;&#8221; asking me &#8220;whether the king or queen of that country were thick of hearing?&#8221;&#160; I told him, &#8220;it was what I had been used to for above two years past, and that I admired as much at the voices of him and his men, who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear them well enough.&#160; But, when I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the streets, to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when I was placed on a table, or held in any person&#8217;s hand.&#8221;&#160; I told him, &#8220;I had likewise observed another thing, that, when I first got into the ship, and the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most little contemptible creatures I had ever beheld.&#8221;&#160; For indeed, while I was in that prince&#8217;s country, I could never endure to look in a glass, after mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself.&#160; The captain said, &#8220;that while we were at supper, he observed me to look at every thing with a sort of wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my laughter, which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some disorder in my brain.&#8221;&#160; I answered, &#8220;it was very true; and I wondered how I could forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver three-pence, a leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a nut-shell;&#8221; and so I went on, describing the rest of his household-stuff and provisions, after the same manner.&#160; For, although he queen had ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in her service, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every side of me, and I winked at my own littleness, as people do at their own faults.&#160; The captain understood my raillery very well, and merrily replied with the old English proverb, &#8220;that he doubted mine eyes were bigger than my belly, for he did not observe my stomach so good, although I had fasted all day;&#8221; and, continuing in his mirth, protested &#8220;he would have gladly given a hundred pounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle&#8217;s bill, and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea; which would certainly have been a most astonishing object, worthy to have the description of it transmitted to future ages:&#8221; and the comparison of Pha&#235;ton was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although I did not much admire the conceit.</p>
<p>The captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.&#160; But meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we sailed southward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course west-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of Good Hope.&#160; Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the reader with a journal of it.&#160; The captain called in at one or two ports, and sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never went out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third day of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape.&#160; I offered to leave my goods in security for payment of my freight: but the captain protested he would not receive one farthing.&#160; We took a kind leave of each other, and I made him promise he would come to see me at my house in Redriff.&#160; I hired a horse and guide for five shillings, which I borrowed of the captain.</p>
<p>As I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees, the cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput.&#160; I was afraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to have them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or two broken heads for my impertinence.</p>
<p>When I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of the servants opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under a gate,) for fear of striking my head.&#160; My wife run out to embrace me, but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be able to reach my mouth.&#160; My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her up with one hand by the waist.&#160; I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies and I a giant.&#160; I told my wife, &#8220;she had been too thrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her daughter to nothing.&#8221;&#160; In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they were all of the captain&#8217;s opinion when he first saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits.&#160; This I mention as an instance of the great power of habit and prejudice.</p>
<p>In a little time, I and my family and friends came to a right understanding: but my wife protested &#8220;I should never go to sea any more;&#8221; although my evil destiny so ordered, that she had not power to hinder me, as the reader may know hereafter.&#160; In the mean time, I here conclude the second part of my unfortunate voyages.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00021">PART III.&#160; A VOYAGE TO LAPUTA, BALNIBARBI, LUGGNAGG, GLUBBDUBDRIB, AND JAPAN.</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3 id="dlepubid00022">CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The author sets out on his third voyage.&#160; Is taken by pirates.&#160; The malice of a Dutchman.&#160; His arrival at an island.&#160; He is received into Laputa.</p>
<p>I had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William Robinson, a Cornish man, commander of the Hopewell, a stout ship of three hundred tons, came to my house.&#160; I had formerly been surgeon of another ship where he was master, and a fourth part owner, in a voyage to the Levant.&#160; He had always treated me more like a brother, than an inferior officer; and, hearing of my arrival, made me a visit, as I apprehended only out of friendship, for nothing passed more than what is usual after long absences.&#160; But repeating his visits often, expressing his joy to find I me in good health, asking, &#8220;whether I were now settled for life?&#8221; adding, &#8220;that he intended a voyage to the East Indies in two months,&#8221; at last he plainly invited me, though with some apologies, to be surgeon of the ship; &#8220;that I should have another surgeon under me, beside our two mates; that my salary should be double to the usual pay; and that having experienced my knowledge in sea-affairs to be at least equal to his, he would enter into any engagement to follow my advice, as much as if I had shared in the command.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said so many other obliging things, and I knew him to be so honest a man, that I could not reject this proposal; the thirst I had of seeing the world, notwithstanding my past misfortunes, continuing as violent as ever.&#160; The only difficulty that remained, was to persuade my wife, whose consent however I at last obtained, by the prospect of advantage she proposed to her children.</p>
<p>We set out the 5th day of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St. George the 11th of April, 1707.&#160; We staid there three weeks to refresh our crew, many of whom were sick.&#160; From thence we went to Tonquin, where the captain resolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he intended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in several months.&#160; Therefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he must be at, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods, wherewith the Tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands, and putting fourteen men on board, whereof three were of the country, he appointed me master of the sloop, and gave me power to traffic, while he transacted his affairs at Tonquin.</p>
<p>We had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were driven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east: after which we had fair weather, but still with a pretty strong gale from the west.&#160; Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon overtook us; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow, neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>We were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered furiously at the head of their men; but finding us all prostrate upon our faces (for so I gave order), they pinioned us with strong ropes, and setting guard upon us, went to search the sloop.</p>
<p>I observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority, though he was not commander of either ship.&#160; He knew us by our countenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language, swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea.&#160; I spoken Dutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in consideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighbouring countries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take some pity on us.&#160; This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings, and turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese language, as I suppose, often using the word <i>Christianos</i>.</p>
<p>The largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese captain, who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly.&#160; He came up to me, and after several questions, which I answered in great humility, he said, &#8220;we should not die.&#8221;&#160; I made the captain a very low bow, and then, turning to the Dutchman, said, &#8220;I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen, than in a brother christian.&#8221;&#160; But I had soon reason to repent those foolish words: for that malicious reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to persuade both the captains that I might be thrown into the sea (which they would not yield to, after the promise made me that I should not die), however, prevailed so far, as to have a punishment inflicted on me, worse, in all human appearance, than death itself.&#160; My men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned.&#160; As to myself, it was determined that I should be set adrift in a small canoe, with paddles and a sail, and four days&#8217; provisions; which last, the Japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores, and would permit no man to search me.&#160; I got down into the canoe, while the Dutchman, standing upon the deck, loaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language could afford.</p>
<p>About an hour before we saw the pirates I had taken an observation, and found we were in the latitude of 46 N. and longitude of 183.&#160; When I was at some distance from the pirates, I discovered, by my pocket-glass, several islands to the south-east.&#160; I set up my sail, the wind being fair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made a shift to do, in about three hours.&#160; It was all rocky: however I got many birds&#8217; eggs; and, striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry sea-weed, by which I roasted my eggs.&#160; I ate no other supper, being resolved to spare my provisions as much as I could.&#160; I passed the night under the shelter of a rock, strewing some heath under me, and slept pretty well.</p>
<p>The next day I sailed to another island, and thence to a third and fourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles.&#160; But, not to trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it suffice, that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in my sight, which lay south-south-east to the former.</p>
<p>This island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not reach it in less than five hours.&#160; I encompassed it almost round, before I could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek, about three times the wideness of my canoe.&#160; I found the island to be all rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling herbs.&#160; I took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself, I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry sea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel, match, and burning-glass.&#160; I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged my provisions.&#160; My bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which I intended for fuel.&#160; I slept very little, for the disquiets of my mind prevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake.&#160; I considered how impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how miserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless and desponding, that I had not the heart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced.&#160; I walked awhile among the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was forced to turn my face from it: when all on a sudden it became obscure, as I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud.&#160; I turned back, and perceived a vast opaque body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island: it seemed to be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than if I had stood under the shade of a mountain.&#160; As it approached nearer over the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from the reflection of the sea below.&#160; I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore, and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me, at less than an English mile distance.&#160; I took out my pocket perspective, and could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of it, which appeared to be sloping; but what those people where doing I was not able to distinguish.</p>
<p>The natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other, help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in.&#160; But at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to behold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it should seem) to raise or sink, or put it into progressive motion, as they pleased.&#160; But not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the island would take, because it seemed for awhile to stand still.&#160; Yet soon after, it advanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to descend from one to the other.&#160; In the lowest gallery, I beheld some people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on.&#160; I waved my cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the island; and upon its nearer approach, I called and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a crowd gather to that side which was most in my view.&#160; I found by their pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me, although they made no return to my shouting.&#160; But I could see four or five men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top of the island, who then disappeared.&#160; I happened rightly to conjecture, that these were sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.</p>
<p>The number of people increased, and, in less than half all hour, the island was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the height where I stood.&#160; I then put myself in the most supplicating posture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer.&#160; Those who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction, as I supposed by their habit.&#160; They conferred earnestly with each other, looking often upon me.&#160; At length one of them called out in a clear, polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore I returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence might be more agreeable to his ears.&#160; Although neither of us understood the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the distress I was in.</p>
<p>They made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a convenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.</p>
<h3 id="dlepubid00023">CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The humours and dispositions of the Laputians described.&#160; An account of their learning.&#160; Of the king and his court.&#160; The author&#8217;s reception there.&#160; The inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes.&#160; An account of the women.</p>
<p>At my alighting, I was surrounded with a crowd of people, but those who stood nearest seemed to be of better quality.&#160; They beheld me with all the marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much in their debt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their shapes, habits, and countenances.&#160; Their heads were all reclined, either to the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other directly up to the zenith.&#160; Their outward garments were adorned with the figures of suns, moons, and stars; interwoven with those of fiddles, flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many other instruments of music, unknown to us in Europe.&#160; I observed, here and there, many in the habit of servants, with a blown bladder, fastened like a flail to the end of a stick, which they carried in their hands.&#160; In each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas, or little pebbles, as I was afterwards informed.&#160; With these bladders, they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who stood near them, of which practice I could not then conceive the meaning.&#160; It seems the minds of these people are so taken up with intense speculations, that they neither can speak, nor attend to the discourses of others, without being roused by some external taction upon the organs of speech and hearing; for which reason, those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the original is <i>climenole</i>) in their family, as one of their domestics; nor ever walk abroad, or make visits, without him.&#160; And the business of this officer is, when two, three, or more persons are in company, gently to strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak, and the right ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself.&#160; This flapper is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks, and upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes; because he is always so wrapped up in cogitation, that he is in manifest danger of falling down every precipice, and bouncing his head against every post; and in the streets, of justling others, or being justled himself into the kennel.</p>
<p>It was necessary to give the reader this information, without which he would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these people, as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island, and from thence to the royal palace.&#160; While we were ascending, they forgot several times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their memories were again roused by their flappers; for they appeared altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance, and by the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more disengaged.</p>
<p>At last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of presence, where I saw the king seated on his throne, attended on each side by persons of prime quality.&#160; Before the throne, was a large table filled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all kinds.&#160; His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all persons belonging to the court.&#160; But he was then deep in a problem; and we attended at least an hour, before he could solve it.&#160; There stood by him, on each side, a young page with flaps in their hands, and when they saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and the other his right ear; at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden, and looking towards me and the company I was in, recollected the occasion of our coming, whereof he had been informed before.&#160; He spoke some words, whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and flapped me gently on the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an instrument; which, as I afterwards found, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a very mean opinion of my understanding.&#160; The king, as far as I could conjecture, asked me several questions, and I addressed myself to him in all the languages I had.&#160; When it was found I could neither understand nor be understood, I was conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to strangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me.&#160; My dinner was brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered to have seen very near the king&#8217;s person, did me the honour to dine with me.&#160; We had two courses, of three dishes each.&#160; In the first course, there was a shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into a rhomboides, and a pudding into a cycloid.&#160; The second course was two ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling flutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp.&#160; The servants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several other mathematical figures.</p>
<p>While we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several things in their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their flappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of their great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them.&#160; I was soon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else I wanted.</p>
<p>After dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the king&#8217;s order, attended by a flapper.&#160; He brought with him pen, ink, and paper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that he was sent to teach me the language.&#160; We sat together four hours, in which time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the translations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk, and the like.&#160; Then I took down the sentence in writing.&#160; He showed me also, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations of many plains and solids.&#160; He gave me the names and descriptions of all the musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing on each of them.&#160; After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their interpretations, in alphabetical order.&#160; And thus, in a few days, by the help of a very faithful memory, I got some insight into their language.&#160; The word, which I interpret the flying or floating island, is in the original <i>Laputa</i>, whereof I could never learn the true etymology.&#160; <i>Lap</i>, in the old obsolete language, signifies high; and <i>untuh</i>, a governor; from which they say, by corruption, was derived <i>Laputa</i>, from <i>Lapuntuh</i>.&#160; But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a little strained.&#160; I ventured to offer to the learned among them a conjecture of my own, that Laputa was <i>quasi lap outed</i>; <i>lap</i>, signifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and <i>outed</i>, a wing; which, however, I shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious reader.</p>
