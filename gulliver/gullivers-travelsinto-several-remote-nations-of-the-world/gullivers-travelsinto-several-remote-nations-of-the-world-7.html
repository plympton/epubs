<p>If they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are buried in the obscurest places that can be found, their friends and relations expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure; nor does the dying person discover the least regret that he is leaving the world, any more than if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of his neighbours.&#160; I remember my master having once made an appointment with a friend and his family to come to his house, upon some affair of importance: on the day fixed, the mistress and her two children came very late; she made two excuses, first for her husband, who, as she said, happened that very morning to <i>shnuwnh</i>.&#160; The word is strongly expressive in their language, but not easily rendered into English; it signifies, &#8220;to retire to his first mother.&#8221;&#160; Her excuse for not coming sooner, was, that her husband dying late in the morning, she was a good while consulting her servants about a convenient place where his body should be laid; and I observed, she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest.&#160; She died about three months after.</p>
<p>They live generally to seventy, or seventy-five years, very seldom to fourscore.&#160; Some weeks before their death, they feel a gradual decay; but without pain.&#160; During this time they are much visited by their friends, because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction.&#160; However, about ten days before their death, which they seldom fail in computing, they return the visits that have been made them by those who are nearest in the neighbourhood, being carried in a convenient sledge drawn by <i>Yahoos</i>; which vehicle they use, not only upon this occasion, but when they grow old, upon long journeys, or when they are lamed by any accident: and therefore when the dying <i>Houyhnhnms</i> return those visits, they take a solemn leave of their friends, as if they were going to some remote part of the country, where they designed to pass the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>I know not whether it may be worth observing, that the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> have no word in their language to express any thing that is evil, except what they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the <i>Yahoos</i>.&#160; Thus they denote the folly of a servant, an omission of a child, a stone that cuts their feet, a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather, and the like, by adding to each the epithet of <i>Yahoo</i>.&#160; For instance, <i>hhnm Yahoo</i>; <i>whnaholm Yahoo</i>, <i>ynlhmndwihlma Yahoo</i>, and an ill-contrived house <i>ynholmhnmrohlnw Yahoo</i>.</p>
<p>I could, with great pleasure, enlarge further upon the manners and virtues of this excellent people; but intending in a short time to publish a volume by itself, expressly upon that subject, I refer the reader thither; and, in the mean time, proceed to relate my own sad catastrophe.</p>
<h3 id="dlepubid00043">CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The author&#8217;s economy, and happy life, among the Houyhnhnms.&#160; His great improvement in virtue by conversing with them.&#160; Their conversations.&#160; The author has notice given him by his master, that he must depart from the country.&#160; He falls into a swoon for grief; but submits.&#160; He contrives and finishes a canoe by the help of a fellow-servant, and puts to sea at a venture.</p>
<p>I had settled my little economy to my own heart&#8217;s content.&#160; My master had ordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards from the house: the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay, and covered with rush-mats of my own contriving.&#160; I had beaten hemp, which there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I filled with the feathers of several birds I had taken with springes made of <i>Yahoos&#8217;</i> hairs, and were excellent food.&#160; I had worked two chairs with my knife, the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part.&#160; When my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called <i>nnuhnoh</i>, the skin of which is covered with a fine down.&#160; Of these I also made very tolerable stockings.&#160; I soled my shoes with wood, which I cut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather; and when this was worn out, I supplied it with the skins of <i>Yahoos</i> dried in the sun.&#160; I often got honey out of hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with my bread.&#160; No man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, &#8220;That nature is very easily satisfied;&#8221; and, &#8220;That necessity is the mother of invention.&#8221;&#160; I enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquillity of mind; I did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries of a secret or open enemy.&#160; I had no occasion of bribing, flattering, or pimping, to procure the favour of any great man, or of his minion; I wanted no fence against fraud or oppression: here was neither physician to destroy my body, nor lawyer to ruin my fortune; no informer to watch my words and actions, or forge accusations against me for hire: here were no gibers, censurers, backbiters, pickpockets, highwaymen, housebreakers, attorneys, bawds, buffoons, gamesters, politicians, wits, splenetics, tedious talkers, controvertists, ravishers, murderers, robbers, virtuosos; no leaders, or followers, of party and faction; no encouragers to vice, by seducement or examples; no dungeon, axes, gibbets, whipping-posts, or pillories; no cheating shopkeepers or mechanics; no pride, vanity, or affectation; no fops, bullies, drunkards, strolling whores, or poxes; no ranting, lewd, expensive wives; no stupid, proud pedants; no importunate, overbearing, quarrelsome, noisy, roaring, empty, conceited, swearing companions; no scoundrels raised from the dust upon the merit of their vices, or nobility thrown into it on account of their virtues; no lords, fiddlers, judges, or dancing-masters.</p>
<p>I had the favour of being admitted to several <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, who came to visit or dine with my master; where his honour graciously suffered me to wait in the room, and listen to their discourse.&#160; Both he and his company would often descend to ask me questions, and receive my answers.&#160; I had also sometimes the honour of attending my master in his visits to others.&#160; I never presumed to speak, except in answer to a question; and then I did it with inward regret, because it was a loss of so much time for improving myself; but I was infinitely delighted with the station of an humble auditor in such conversations, where nothing passed but what was useful, expressed in the fewest and most significant words; where, as I have already said, the greatest decency was observed, without the least degree of ceremony; where no person spoke without being pleased himself, and pleasing his companions; where there was no interruption, tediousness, heat, or difference of sentiments.&#160; They have a notion, that when people are met together, a short silence does much improve conversation: this I found to be true; for during those little intermissions of talk, new ideas would arise in their minds, which very much enlivened the discourse.&#160; Their subjects are, generally on friendship and benevolence, on order and economy; sometimes upon the visible operations of nature, or ancient traditions; upon the bounds and limits of virtue; upon the unerring rules of reason, or upon some determinations to be taken at the next great assembly: and often upon the various excellences of poetry.&#160; I may add, without vanity, that my presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse, because it afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of me and my country, upon which they were all pleased to descant, in a manner not very advantageous to humankind: and for that reason I shall not repeat what they said; only I may be allowed to observe, that his honour, to my great admiration, appeared to understand the nature of <i>Yahoos</i> much better than myself.&#160; He went through all our vices and follies, and discovered many, which I had never mentioned to him, by only supposing what qualities a <i>Yahoo</i> of their country, with a small proportion of reason, might be capable of exerting; and concluded, with too much probability, &#8220;how vile, as well as miserable, such a creature must be.&#8221;</p>
<p>I freely confess, that all the little knowledge I have of any value, was acquired by the lectures I received from my master, and from hearing the discourses of him and his friends; to which I should be prouder to listen, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in Europe.&#160; I admired the strength, comeliness, and speed of the inhabitants; and such a constellation of virtues, in such amiable persons, produced in me the highest veneration.&#160; At first, indeed, I did not feel that natural awe, which the <i>Yahoos</i> and all other animals bear toward them; but it grew upon me by decrees, much sooner than I imagined, and was mingled with a respectful love and gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish me from the rest of my species.</p>
<p>When I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race in general, I considered them, as they really were, <i>Yahoos</i> in shape and disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift of speech; but making no other use of reason, than to improve and multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the share that nature allotted them.&#160; When I happened to behold the reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, I turned away my face in horror and detestation of myself, and could better endure the sight of a common <i>Yahoo</i> than of my own person.&#160; By conversing with the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate their gait and gesture, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends often tell me, in a blunt way, &#8220;that I trot like a horse;&#8221; which, however, I take for a great compliment.&#160; Neither shall I disown, that in speaking I am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, and hear myself ridiculed on that account, without the least mortification.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this happiness, and when I looked upon myself to be fully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little earlier than his usual hour.&#160; I observed by his countenance that he was in some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak.&#160; After a short silence, he told me, &#8220;he did not know how I would take what he was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the affair of the <i>Yahoos</i> was entered upon, the representatives had taken offence at his keeping a <i>Yahoo</i> (meaning myself) in his family, more like a <i>Houyhnhnm</i> than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company; that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim back to the place whence I came: that the first of these expedients was utterly rejected by all the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> who had ever seen me at his house or their own; for they alleged, that because I had some rudiments of reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be feared I might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous parts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the <i>Houyhnhnms&#8217;</i> cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse from labour.&#8221;</p>
<p>My master added, &#8220;that he was daily pressed by the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> of the neighbourhood to have the assembly&#8217;s exhortation executed, which he could not put off much longer.&#160; He doubted it would be impossible for me to swim to another country; and therefore wished I would contrive some sort of vehicle, resembling those I had described to him, that might carry me on the sea; in which work I should have the assistance of his own servants, as well as those of his neighbours.&#8221;&#160; He concluded, &#8220;that for his own part, he could have been content to keep me in his service as long as I lived; because he found I had cured myself of some bad habits and dispositions, by endeavouring, as far as my inferior nature was capable, to imitate the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general assembly in this country is expressed by the word <i>hnhloayn</i>, which signifies an exhortation, as near as I can render it; for they have no conception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only advised, or exhorted; because no person can disobey reason, without giving up his claim to be a rational creature.</p>
<p>I was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master&#8217;s discourse; and being unable to support the agonies I was under, I fell into a swoon at his feet.&#160; When I came to myself, he told me &#8220;that he concluded I had been dead;&#8221; for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of nature.&#160; I answered in a faint voice, &#8220;that death would have been too great a happiness; that although I could not blame the assembly&#8217;s exhortation, or the urgency of his friends; yet, in my weak and corrupt judgment, I thought it might consist with reason to have been less rigorous; that I could not swim a league, and probably the nearest land to theirs might be distant above a hundred: that many materials, necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off, were wholly wanting in this country; which, however, I would attempt, in obedience and gratitude to his honour, although I concluded the thing to be impossible, and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction; that the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils; for, supposing I should escape with life by some strange adventure, how could I think with temper of passing my days among <i>Yahoos</i>, and relapsing into my old corruptions, for want of examples to lead and keep me within the paths of virtue? that I knew too well upon what solid reasons all the determinations of the wise <i>Houyhnhnms</i> were founded, not to be shaken by arguments of mine, a miserable <i>Yahoo</i>; and therefore, after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants&#8217; assistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so difficult a work, I told him I would endeavour to preserve a wretched being; and if ever I returned to England, was not without hopes of being useful to my own species, by celebrating the praises of the renowned <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankind.&#8221;</p>
<p>My master, in a few words, made me a very gracious reply; allowed me the space of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag, my fellow-servant (for so, at this distance, I may presume to call him), to follow my instruction; because I told my master, &#8220;that his help would be sufficient, and I knew he had a tenderness for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his company, my first business was to go to that part of the coast where my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore.&#160; I got upon a height, and looking on every side into the sea; fancied I saw a small island toward the north-east.&#160; I took out my pocket glass, and could then clearly distinguish it above five leagues off, as I computed; but it appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud: for as he had no conception of any country beside his own, so he could not be as expert in distinguishing remote objects at sea, as we who so much converse in that element.</p>
<p>After I had discovered this island, I considered no further; but resolved it should if possible, be the first place of my banishment, leaving the consequence to fortune.</p>
<p>I returned home, and consulting with the sorrel nag, we went into a copse at some distance, where I with my knife, and he with a sharp flint, fastened very artificially after their manner, to a wooden handle, cut down several oak wattles, about the thickness of a walking-staff, and some larger pieces.&#160; But I shall not trouble the reader with a particular description of my own mechanics; let it suffice to say, that in six weeks time with the help of the sorrel nag, who performed the parts that required most labour, I finished a sort of Indian canoe, but much larger, covering it with the skins of <i>Yahoos</i>, well stitched together with hempen threads of my own making.&#160; My sail was likewise composed of the skins of the same animal; but I made use of the youngest I could get, the older being too tough and thick; and I likewise provided myself with four paddles.&#160; I laid in a stock of boiled flesh, of rabbits and fowls, and took with me two vessels, one filled with milk and the other with water.</p>
<p>I tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master&#8217;s house, and then corrected in it what was amiss; stopping all the chinks with <i>Yahoos&#8217;</i> tallow, till I found it staunch, and able to bear me and my freight; and, when it was as complete as I could possibly make it, I had it drawn on a carriage very gently by <i>Yahoos</i> to the sea-side, under the conduct of the sorrel nag and another servant.</p>
<p>When all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took leave of my master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears, and my heart quite sunk with grief.&#160; But his honour, out of curiosity, and, perhaps, (if I may speak without vanity,) partly out of kindness, was determined to see me in my canoe, and got several of his neighbouring friends to accompany him.&#160; I was forced to wait above an hour for the tide; and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing toward the island to which I intended to steer my course, I took a second leave of my master: but as I was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof, he did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth.&#160; I am not ignorant how much I have been censured for mentioning this last particular.&#160; Detractors are pleased to think it improbable, that so illustrious a person should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to a creature so inferior as I.&#160; Neither have I forgotten how apt some travellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have received.&#160; But, if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble and courteous disposition of the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, they would soon change their opinion.</p>
<p>I paid my respects to the rest of the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> in his honour&#8217;s company; then getting into my canoe, I pushed off from shore.</p>
<h3 id="dlepubid00044">CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The author&#8217;s dangerous voyage.&#160; He arrives at New Holland, hoping to settle there.&#160; Is wounded with an arrow by one of the natives.&#160; Is seized and carried by force into a Portuguese ship.&#160; The great civilities of the captain.&#160; The author arrives at England.</p>
<p>I began this desperate voyage on February 15, 1714&#8211;15, at nine o&#8217;clock in the morning.&#160; The wind was very favourable; however, I made use at first only of my paddles; but considering I should soon be weary, and that the wind might chop about, I ventured to set up my little sail; and thus, with the help of the tide, I went at the rate of a league and a half an hour, as near as I could guess.&#160; My master and his friends continued on the shore till I was almost out of sight; and I often heard the sorrel nag (who always loved me) crying out, &#8220;<i>Hnuy illa nyha</i>, <i>majah Yahoo</i>;&#8221; &#8220;Take care of thyself, gentle <i>Yahoo</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>My design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited, yet sufficient, by my labour, to furnish me with the necessaries of life, which I would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first minister in the politest court of Europe; so horrible was the idea I conceived of returning to live in the society, and under the government of <i>Yahoos</i>.&#160; For in such a solitude as I desired, I could at least enjoy my own thoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and corruptions of my own species.</p>
<p>The reader may remember what I related, when my crew conspired against me, and confined me to my cabin; how I continued there several weeks without knowing what course we took; and when I was put ashore in the long-boat, how the sailors told me, with oaths, whether true or false, &#8220;that they knew not in what part of the world we were.&#8221;&#160; However, I did then believe us to be about 10 degrees southward of the Cape of Good Hope, or about 45 degrees southern latitude, as I gathered from some general words I overheard among them, being I supposed to the south-east in their intended voyage to Madagascar.&#160; And although this were little better than conjecture, yet I resolved to steer my course eastward, hoping to reach the south-west coast of New Holland, and perhaps some such island as I desired lying westward of it.&#160; The wind was full west, and by six in the evening I computed I had gone eastward at least eighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half a league off, which I soon reached.&#160; It was nothing but a rock, with one creek naturally arched by the force of tempests.&#160; Here I put in my canoe, and climbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land to the east, extending from south to north.&#160; I lay all night in my canoe; and repeating my voyage early in the morning, I arrived in seven hours to the south-east point of New Holland.&#160; This confirmed me in the opinion I have long entertained, that the maps and charts place this country at least three degrees more to the east than it really is; which thought I communicated many years ago to my worthy friend, Mr. Herman Moll, and gave him my reasons for it, although he has rather chosen to follow other authors.</p>
<p>I saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I was afraid of venturing far into the country.&#160; I found some shellfish on the shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of being discovered by the natives.&#160; I continued three days feeding on oysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I fortunately found a brook of excellent water, which gave me great relief.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw twenty or thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me.&#160; They were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I could discover by the smoke.&#160; One of them spied me, and gave notice to the rest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving the women and children at the fire.&#160; I made what haste I could to the shore, and, getting into my canoe, shoved off: the savages, observing me retreat, ran after me: and before I could get far enough into the sea, discharged an arrow which wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee: I shall carry the mark to my grave.&#160; I apprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling out of the reach of their darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck the wound, and dress it as well as I could.</p>
<p>I was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same landing-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for the wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west.&#160; As I was looking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the north-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, I was in some doubt whether I should wait for them or not; but at last my detestation of the <i>Yahoo</i> race prevailed: and turning my canoe, I sailed and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek whence I set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among these barbarians, than live with European <i>Yahoos</i>.&#160; I drew up my canoe as close as I could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the little brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent water.</p>
<p>The ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her long boat with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very well known); but I did not observe it, till the boat was almost on shore; and it was too late to seek another hiding-place.&#160; The seamen at their landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over, easily conjectured that the owner could not be far off.&#160; Four of them, well armed, searched every cranny and lurking-hole, till at last they found me flat on my face behind the stone.&#160; They gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth dress; my coat made of skins, my wooden-soled shoes, and my furred stockings; whence, however, they concluded, I was not a native of the place, who all go naked.&#160; One of the seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise, and asked who I was.&#160; I understood that language very well, and getting upon my feet, said, &#8220;I was a poor <i>Yahoo</i> banished from the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, and desired they would please to let me depart.&#8221;&#160; They admired to hear me answer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a European; but were at a loss to know what I meant by <i>Yahoos</i> and <i>Houyhnhnms</i>; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in speaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse.&#160; I trembled all the while betwixt fear and hatred.&#160; I again desired leave to depart, and was gently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know, &#8220;what country I was of? whence I came?&#8221; with many other questions.&#160; I told them &#8220;I was born in England, whence I came about five years ago, and then their country and ours were at peace.&#160; I therefore hoped they would not treat me as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but was a poor <i>Yahoo</i> seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his unfortunate life.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing more unnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should speak in England, or a <i>Yahoo</i> in <i>Houyhnhnmland</i>.&#160; The honest Portuguese were equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner of delivering my words, which, however, they understood very well.&#160; They spoke to me with great humanity, and said, &#8220;they were sure the captain would carry me <i>gratis</i> to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own country; that two of the seamen would go back to the ship, inform the captain of what they had seen, and receive his orders; in the mean time, unless I would give my solemn oath not to fly, they would secure me by force.&#160; I thought it best to comply with their proposal.&#160; They were very curious to know my story, but I gave them very little satisfaction, and they all conjectured that my misfortunes had impaired my reason.&#160; In two hours the boat, which went laden with vessels of water, returned, with the captain&#8217;s command to fetch me on board.&#160; I fell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all was in vain; and the men, having tied me with cords, heaved me into the boat, whence I was taken into the ship, and thence into the captain&#8217;s cabin.</p>
<p>His name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous person.&#160; He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to know what I would eat or drink; said, &#8220;I should be used as well as himself;&#8221; and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such civilities from a <i>Yahoo</i>.&#160; However, I remained silent and sullen; I was ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men.&#160; At last I desired something to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a chicken, and some excellent wine, and then directed that I should be put to bed in a very clean cabin.&#160; I would not undress myself, but lay on the bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when I thought the crew was at dinner, and getting to the side of the ship, was going to leap into the sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue among <i>Yahoos</i>.&#160; But one of the seamen prevented me, and having informed the captain, I was chained to my cabin.</p>
<p>After dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for so desperate an attempt; assured me, &#8220;he only meant to do me all the service he was able;&#8221; and spoke so very movingly, that at last I descended to treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason.&#160; I gave him a very short relation of my voyage; of the conspiracy against me by my own men; of the country where they set me on shore, and of my five years residence there.&#160; All which he looked upon as if it were a dream or a vision; whereat I took great offence; for I had quite forgot the faculty of lying, so peculiar to <i>Yahoos</i>, in all countries where they preside, and, consequently, their disposition of suspecting truth in others of their own species.&#160; I asked him, &#8220;whether it were the custom in his country to say the thing which was not?&#8221;&#160; I assured him, &#8220;I had almost forgot what he meant by falsehood, and if I had lived a thousand years in <i>Houyhnhnmland</i>, I should never have heard a lie from the meanest servant; that I was altogether indifferent whether he believed me or not; but, however, in return for his favours, I would give so much allowance to the corruption of his nature, as to answer any objection he would please to make, and then he might easily discover the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain, a wise man, after many endeavours to catch me tripping in some part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my veracity.&#160; But he added, &#8220;that since I professed so inviolable an attachment to truth, I must give him my word and honour to bear him company in this voyage, without attempting any thing against my life; or else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at Lisbon.&#8221;&#160; I gave him the promise he required; but at the same time protested, &#8220;that I would suffer the greatest hardships, rather than return to live among <i>Yahoos</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our voyage passed without any considerable accident.&#160; In gratitude to the captain, I sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and strove to conceal my antipathy against human kind, although it often broke out; which he suffered to pass without observation.&#160; But the greatest part of the day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing any of the crew.&#160; The captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress, and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had.&#160; This I would not be prevailed on to accept, abhorring to cover myself with any thing that had been on the back of a <i>Yahoo</i>.&#160; I only desired he would lend me two clean shirts, which, having been washed since he wore them, I believed would not so much defile me.&#160; These I changed every second day, and washed them myself.</p>
<p>We arrived at Lisbon, Nov. 5, 1715.&#160; At our landing, the captain forced me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding about me.&#160; I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he led me up to the highest room backwards.&#160; I conjured him &#8220;to conceal from all persons what I had told him of the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>; because the least hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, but probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the Inquisition.&#8221;&#160; The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly made; but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure; however, Don Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.&#160; He accoutred me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for twenty-four hours before I would use them.</p>
<p>The captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were suffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging, added to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate his company.&#160; He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of the back window.&#160; By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I peeped into the street, but drew my head back in a fright.&#160; In a week&#8217;s time he seduced me down to the door.&#160; I found my terror gradually lessened, but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase.&#160; I was at last bold enough to walk the street in his company, but kept my nose well stopped with rue, or sometimes with tobacco.</p>
<p>In ten days, Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my domestic affairs, put it upon me, as a matter of honour and conscience, &#8220;that I ought to return to my native country, and live at home with my wife and children.&#8221;&#160; He told me, &#8220;there was an English ship in the port just ready to sail, and he would furnish me with all things necessary.&#8221;&#160; It would be tedious to repeat his arguments, and my contradictions.&#160; He said, &#8220;it was altogether impossible to find such a solitary island as I desired to live in; but I might command in my own house, and pass my time in a manner as recluse as I pleased.&#8221;</p>
<p>I complied at last, finding I could not do better.&#160; I left Lisbon the 24th day of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the master I never inquired.&#160; Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and lent me twenty pounds.&#160; He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at parting, which I bore as well as I could.&#160; During this last voyage I had no commerce with the master or any of his men; but, pretending I was sick, kept close in my cabin.&#160; On the fifth of December, 1715, we cast anchor in the Downs, about nine in the morning, and at three in the afternoon I got safe to my house at Rotherhith. <a id="citation546"></a><a href="gullivers-travelsinto-several-remote-nations-of-the-world-7.html#footnote546" class="citation dlinternal">[546]</a></p>
<p>My wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because they concluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess the sight of them filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the more, by reflecting on the near alliance I had to them.&#160; For although, since my unfortunate exile from the <i>Houyhnhnm</i> country, I had compelled myself to tolerate the sight of <i>Yahoos</i>, and to converse with Don Pedro de Mendez, yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues and ideas of those exalted <i>Houyhnhnms</i>.&#160; And when I began to consider that, by copulating with one of the <i>Yahoo</i> species I had become a parent of more, it struck me with the utmost shame, confusion, and horror.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed me; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for so many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour.&#160; At the time I am writing, it is five years since my last return to England.&#160; During the first year, I could not endure my wife or children in my presence; the very smell of them was intolerable; much less could I suffer them to eat in the same room.&#160; To this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread, or drink out of the same cup, neither was I ever able to let one of them take me by the hand.&#160; The first money I laid out was to buy two young stone-horses, which I keep in a good stable; and next to them, the groom is my greatest favourite, for I feel my spirits revived by the smell he contracts in the stable.&#160; My horses understand me tolerably well; I converse with them at least four hours every day.&#160; They are strangers to bridle or saddle; they live in great amity with me and friendship to each other.</p>
<h3 id="dlepubid00045">CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The author&#8217;s veracity.&#160; His design in publishing this work.&#160; His censure of those travellers who swerve from the truth.&#160; The author clears himself from any sinister ends in writing.&#160; An objection answered.&#160; The method of planting colonies.&#160; His native country commended.&#160; The right of the crown to those countries described by the author is justified.&#160; The difficulty of conquering them.&#160; The author takes his last leave of the reader; proposes his manner of living for the future; gives good advice, and concludes.</p>
<p>Thus, gentle reader, I have given thee a faithful history of my travels for sixteen years and above seven months: wherein I have not been so studious of ornament as of truth.&#160; I could, perhaps, like others, have astonished thee with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to relate plain matter of fact, in the simplest manner and style; because my principal design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.</p>
<p>It is easy for us who travel into remote countries, which are seldom visited by Englishmen or other Europeans, to form descriptions of wonderful animals both at sea and land.&#160; Whereas a traveller&#8217;s chief aim should be to make men wiser and better, and to improve their minds by the bad, as well as good, example of what they deliver concerning foreign places.</p>
<p>I could heartily wish a law was enacted, that every traveller, before he were permitted to publish his voyages, should be obliged to make oath before the Lord High Chancellor, that all he intended to print was absolutely true to the best of his knowledge; for then the world would no longer be deceived, as it usually is, while some writers, to make their works pass the better upon the public, impose the grossest falsities on the unwary reader.&#160; I have perused several books of travels with great delight in my younger days; but having since gone over most parts of the globe, and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts from my own observation, it has given me a great disgust against this part of reading, and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so impudently abused.&#160; Therefore, since my acquaintance were pleased to think my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country, I imposed on myself, as a maxim never to be swerved from, that I would strictly adhere to truth; neither indeed can I be ever under the least temptation to vary from it, while I retain in my mind the lectures and example of my noble master and the other illustrious <i>Houyhnhnms</i> of whom I had so long the honour to be an humble hearer.</p>

<p>I know very well, how little reputation is to be got by writings which require neither genius nor learning, nor indeed any other talent, except a good memory, or an exact journal.&#160; I know likewise, that writers of travels, like dictionary-makers, are sunk into oblivion by the weight and bulk of those who come last, and therefore lie uppermost.&#160; And it is highly probable, that such travellers, who shall hereafter visit the countries described in this work of mine, may, by detecting my errors (if there be any), and adding many new discoveries of their own, justle me out of vogue, and stand in my place, making the world forget that ever I was an author.&#160; This indeed would be too great a mortification, if I wrote for fame: but as my sole intention was the public good, I cannot be altogether disappointed.&#160; For who can read of the virtues I have mentioned in the glorious <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, without being ashamed of his own vices, when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of his country?&#160; I shall say nothing of those remote nations where <i>Yahoos</i> preside; among which the least corrupted are the <i>Brobdingnagians</i>; whose wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to observe.&#160; But I forbear descanting further, and rather leave the judicious reader to his own remarks and application.</p>
<p>I am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with no censurers: for what objections can be made against a writer, who relates only plain facts, that happened in such distant countries, where we have not the least interest, with respect either to trade or negotiations?&#160; I have carefully avoided every fault with which common writers of travels are often too justly charged.&#160; Besides, I meddle not the least with any party, but write without passion, prejudice, or ill-will against any man, or number of men, whatsoever.&#160; I write for the noblest end, to inform and instruct mankind; over whom I may, without breach of modesty, pretend to some superiority, from the advantages I received by conversing so long among the most accomplished <i>Houyhnhnms</i>.&#160; I write without any view to profit or praise.&#160; I never suffer a word to pass that may look like reflection, or possibly give the least offence, even to those who are most ready to take it.&#160; So that I hope I may with justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless; against whom the tribes of Answerers, Considerers, Observers, Reflectors, Detectors, Remarkers, will never be able to find matter for exercising their talents.</p>
<p>I confess, it was whispered to me, &#8220;that I was bound in duty, as a subject of England, to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state at my first coming over; because, whatever lands are discovered by a subject belong to the crown.&#8221;&#160; But I doubt whether our conquests in the countries I treat of would be as easy as those of Ferdinando Cortez over the naked Americans.&#160; The <i>Lilliputians</i>, I think, are hardly worth the charge of a fleet and army to reduce them; and I question whether it might be prudent or safe to attempt the <i>Brobdingnagians</i>; or whether an English army would be much at their ease with the Flying Island over their heads.&#160; The <i>Houyhnhnms</i> indeed appear not to be so well prepared for war, a science to which they are perfect strangers, and especially against missive weapons.&#160; However, supposing myself to be a minister of state, I could never give my advice for invading them.&#160; Their prudence, unanimity, unacquaintedness with fear, and their love of their country, would amply supply all defects in the military art.&#160; Imagine twenty thousand of them breaking into the midst of an European army, confounding the ranks, overturning the carriages, battering the warriors&#8217; faces into mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs; for they would well deserve the character given to Augustus, <i>Recalcitrat undique tutus</i>.&#160; But, instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation, I rather wish they were in a capacity, or disposition, to send a sufficient number of their inhabitants for civilizing Europe, by teaching us the first principles of honour, justice, truth, temperance, public spirit, fortitude, chastity, friendship, benevolence, and fidelity.&#160; The names of all which virtues are still retained among us in most languages, and are to be met with in modern, as well as ancient authors; which I am able to assert from my own small reading.</p>
<p>But I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his majesty&#8217;s dominions by my discoveries.&#160; To say the truth, I had conceived a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon those occasions.&#160; For instance, a crew of pirates are driven by a storm they know not whither; at length a boy discovers land from the topmast; they go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a harmless people, are entertained with kindness; they give the country a new name; they take formal possession of it for their king; they set up a rotten plank, or a stone, for a memorial; they murder two or three dozen of the natives, bring away a couple more, by force, for a sample; return home, and get their pardon.&#160; Here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by divine right.&#160; Ships are sent with the first opportunity; the natives driven out or destroyed; their princes tortured to discover their gold; a free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust, the earth reeking with the blood of its inhabitants: and this execrable crew of butchers, employed in so pious an expedition, is a modern colony, sent to convert and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people!</p>
<p>But this description, I confess, does by no means affect the British nation, who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom, care, and justice in planting colonies; their liberal endowments for the advancement of religion and learning; their choice of devout and able pastors to propagate Christianity; their caution in stocking their provinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the mother kingdom; their strict regard to the distribution of justice, in supplying the civil administration through all their colonies with officers of the greatest abilities, utter strangers to corruption; and, to crown all, by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors, who have no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they preside, and the honour of the king their master.</p>
<p>But as those countries which I have described do not appear to have any desire of being conquered and enslaved, murdered or driven out by colonies, nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco, I did humbly conceive, they were by no means proper objects of our zeal, our valour, or our interest.&#160; However, if those whom it more concerns think fit to be of another opinion, I am ready to depose, when I shall be lawfully called, that no European did ever visit those countries before me.&#160; I mean, if the inhabitants ought to be believed, unless a dispute may arise concerning the two <i>Yahoos</i>, said to have been seen many years ago upon a mountain in <i>Houyhnhnmland</i>.</p>
<p>But, as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign&#8217;s name, it never came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet, as my affairs then stood, I should perhaps, in point of prudence and self-preservation, have put it off to a better opportunity.</p>
<p>Having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against me as a traveller, I here take a final leave of all my courteous readers, and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at Redriff; to apply those excellent lessons of virtue which I learned among the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>; to instruct the <i>Yahoos</i> of my own family, is far as I shall find them docible animals; to behold my figure often in a glass, and thus, if possible, habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of a human creature; to lament the brutality to <i>Houyhnhnms</i> in my own country, but always treat their persons with respect, for the sake of my noble master, his family, his friends, and the whole <i>Houyhnhnm</i> race, whom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all their lineaments, however their intellectuals came to degenerate.</p>
<p>I began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me, at the farthest end of a long table; and to answer (but with the utmost brevity) the few questions I asked her.&#160; Yet, the smell of a <i>Yahoo</i> continuing very offensive, I always keep my nose well stopped with rue, lavender, or tobacco leaves.&#160; And, although it be hard for a man late in life to remove old habits, I am not altogether out of hopes, in some time, to suffer a neighbour <i>Yahoo</i> in my company, without the apprehensions I am yet under of his teeth or his claws.</p>
<p>My reconcilement to the <i>Yahoo</i> kind in general might not be so difficult, if they would be content with those vices and follies only which nature has entitled them to.&#160; I am not in the least provoked at the sight of a lawyer, a pickpocket, a colonel, a fool, a lord, a gamester, a politician, a whoremonger, a physician, an evidence, a suborner, an attorney, a traitor, or the like; this is all according to the due course of things: but when I behold a lump of deformity and diseases, both in body and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately breaks all the measures of my patience; neither shall I be ever able to comprehend how such an animal, and such a vice, could tally together.&#160; The wise and virtuous <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rational creature, have no name for this vice in their language, which has no terms to express any thing that is evil, except those whereby they describe the detestable qualities of their <i>Yahoos</i>, among which they were not able to distinguish this of pride, for want of thoroughly understanding human nature, as it shows itself in other countries where that animal presides.&#160; But I, who had more experience, could plainly observe some rudiments of it among the wild <i>Yahoos</i>.</p>
<p>But the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, who live under the government of reason, are no more proud of the good qualities they possess, than I should be for not wanting a leg or an arm; which no man in his wits would boast of, although he must be miserable without them.&#160; I dwell the longer upon this subject from the desire I have to make the society of an English <i>Yahoo</i> by any means not insupportable; and therefore I here entreat those who have any tincture of this absurd vice, that they will not presume to come in my sight.</p>
