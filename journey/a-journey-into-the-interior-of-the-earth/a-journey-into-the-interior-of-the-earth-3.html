<h3 id="id00918">THE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS</h3>

<p id="id00919" style="margin-top: 2em">At eight in the morning a ray of daylight came to wake us up. The
thousand shining surfaces of lava on the walls received it on its
passage, and scattered it like a shower of sparks.</p>

<p id="id00920">There was light enough to distinguish surrounding objects.</p>

<p id="id00921">"Well, Axel, what do you say to it?" cried my uncle, rubbing his
hands. "Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at
K&#246;nigsberg? No noise of cart wheels, no cries of basket women, no
boatmen shouting!"</p>

<p id="id00922">"No doubt it is very quiet at the bottom of this well, but there is
something alarming in the quietness itself."</p>

<p id="id00923">"Now come!" my uncle cried; "if you are frightened already, what will
you be by and by? We have not gone a single inch yet into the bowels
of the earth."</p>

<p id="id00924">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id00925">"I mean that we have only reached the level of the island, long
vertical tube, which terminates at the mouth of the crater, has its
lower end only at the level of the sea."</p>

<p id="id00926">"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p id="id00927">"Quite sure. Consult the barometer."</p>

<p id="id00928">In fact, the mercury, which had risen in the instrument as fast as we
descended, had stopped at twenty-nine inches.</p>

<p id="id00929">"You see," said the Professor, "we have now only the pressure of our
atmosphere, and I shall be glad when the aneroid takes the place of
the barometer."</p>

<p id="id00930">And in truth this instrument would become useless as soon as the
weight of the atmosphere should exceed the pressure ascertained at
the level of the sea.</p>

<p id="id00931">"But," I said, "is there not reason to fear that this ever-increasing
pressure will become at last very painful to bear?"</p>

<p id="id00932">"No; we shall descend at a slow rate, and our lungs will become
inured to a denser atmosphere. Aeronauts find the want of air as they
rise to high elevations, but we shall perhaps have too much: of the
two, this is what I should prefer. Don't let us lose a moment. Where
is the bundle we sent down before us?"</p>

<p id="id00933">I then remembered that we had searched for it in vain the evening
before. My uncle questioned Hans, who, after having examined
attentively with the eye of a huntsman, replied:</p>

<p id="id00934">"<i>Der huppe!</i>"</p>

<p id="id00935">"Up there."</p>

<p id="id00936">And so it was. The bundle had been caught by a projection a hundred
feet above us. Immediately the Icelander climbed up like a cat, and
in a few minutes the package was in our possession.</p>

<p id="id00937">"Now," said my uncle, "let us breakfast; but we must lay in a good
stock, for we don't know how long we may have to go on."</p>

<p id="id00938">The biscuit and extract of meat were washed down with a draught of
water mingled with a little gin.</p>

<p id="id00939">Breakfast over, my uncle drew from his pocket a small notebook,
intended for scientific observations. He consulted his instruments,
and recorded:</p>

<p id="id00940">"Monday, July 1.</p>

<p id="id00941">"Chronometer, 8.17 a.m.; barometer, 297 in.; thermometer, 6&#176; (43&#176;<br>

F.). Direction, E.S.E."<br></p>

<p id="id00942">This last observation applied to the dark gallery, and was indicated
by the compass.</p>

<p id="id00943">"Now, Axel," cried the Professor with enthusiasm, "now we are really
going into the interior of the earth. At this precise moment the
journey commences."</p>

<p id="id00944">So saying, my uncle took in one hand Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which was
hanging from his neck; and with the other he formed an electric
communication with the coil in the lantern, and a sufficiently bright
light dispersed the darkness of the passage.</p>

<p id="id00945">Hans carried the other apparatus, which was also put into action.
This ingenious application of electricity would enable us to go on
for a long time by creating an artificial light even in the midst of
the most inflammable gases.</p>

<p id="id00946">"Now, march!" cried my uncle.</p>

<p id="id00947">Each shouldered his package. Hans drove before him the load of cords
and clothes; and, myself walking last, we entered the gallery.</p>

<p id="id00948">At the moment of becoming engulfed in this dark gallery, I raised my
head, and saw for the last time through the length of that vast tube
the sky of Iceland, which I was never to behold again.</p>

<p id="id00949">The lava, in the last eruption of 1229, had forced a passage through
this tunnel. It still lined the walls with a thick and glistening
coat. The electric light was here intensified a hundredfold by
reflection.</p>

<p id="id00950">The only difficulty in proceeding lay in not sliding too fast down an
incline of about forty-five degrees; happily certain asperities and a
few blisterings here and there formed steps, and we descended,
letting our baggage slip before us from the end of a long rope.</p>

<p id="id00951">But that which formed steps under our feet became stalactites
overhead. The lava, which was porous in many places, had formed a
surface covered with small rounded blisters; crystals of opaque
quartz, set with limpid tears of glass, and hanging like clustered
chandeliers from the vaulted roof, seemed as it were to kindle and
form a sudden illumination as we passed on our way. It seemed as if
the genii of the depths were lighting up their palace to receive
their terrestrial guests.</p>

<p id="id00952">"It is magnificent!" I cried spontaneously. "My uncle, what a sight!
Don't you admire those blending hues of lava, passing from reddish
brown to bright yellow by imperceptible shades? And these crystals
are just like globes of light."</p>

<p id="id00953">"Ali, you think so, do you, Axel, my boy? Well, you will see greater
splendours than these, I hope. Now let us march: march!"</p>

<p id="id00954">He had better have said slide, for we did nothing but drop down the
steep inclines. It was the facifs <i>descensus Averni</i> of Virgil. The
compass, which I consulted frequently, gave our direction as
south-east with inflexible steadiness. This lava stream deviated
neither to the right nor to the left.</p>

<p id="id00955">Yet there was no sensible increase of temperature. This justified
Davy's theory, and more than once I consulted the thermometer with
surprise. Two hours after our departure it only marked 10&#176; (50&#176;
Fahr.), an increase of only 4&#176;. This gave reason for believing that
our descent was more horizontal than vertical. As for the exact depth
reached, it was very easy to ascertain that; the Professor measured
accurately the angles of deviation and inclination on the road, but
he kept the results to himself.</p>

<p id="id00956">About eight in the evening he signalled to stop. Hans sat down at
once. The lamps were hung upon a projection in the lava; we were in a
sort of cavern where there was plenty of air. Certain puffs of air
reached us. What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them? I
could not answer that question at the moment. Hunger and fatigue made
me incapable of reasoning. A descent of seven hours consecutively is
not made without considerable expenditure of strength. I was
exhausted. The order to 'halt' therefore gave me pleasure. Hans laid
our provisions upon a block of lava, and we ate with a good appetite.
But one thing troubled me, our supply of water was half consumed. My
uncle reckoned upon a fresh supply from subterranean sources, but
hitherto we had met with none. I could not help drawing his attention
to this circumstance.</p>

<p id="id00957">"Are you surprised at this want of springs?" he said.</p>

<p id="id00958">"More than that, I am anxious about it; we have only water enough for
five days."</p>

<p id="id00959">"Don't be uneasy, Axel, we shall find more than we want."</p>

<p id="id00960">"When?"</p>

<p id="id00961">"When we have left this bed of lava behind us. How could springs
break through such walls as these?"</p>

<p id="id00962">"But perhaps this passage runs to a very great depth. It seems to me
that we have made no great progress vertically."</p>

<p id="id00963">"Why do you suppose that?"</p>

<p id="id00964">"Because if we had gone deep into the crust of earth, we should have
encountered greater heat."</p>

<p id="id00965">"According to your system," said my uncle. "But what does the
thermometer say?"</p>

<p id="id00966">"Hardly fifteen degrees (59&#176; Fahr), nine degrees only since our
departure."</p>

<p id="id00967">"Well, what is your conclusion?"</p>

<p id="id00968">"This is my conclusion. According to exact observations, the increase
of temperature in the interior of the globe advances at the rate of
one degree (1 4/5&#176; Fahr.) for every hundred feet. But certain local
conditions may modify this rate. Thus at Yakoutsk in Siberia the
increase of a degree is ascertained to be reached every 36 feet. This
difference depends upon the heat-conducting power of the rocks.
Moreover, in the neighbourhood of an extinct volcano, through gneiss,
it has been observed that the increase of a degree is only attained
at every 125 feet. Let us therefore assume this last hypothesis as
the most suitable to our situation, and calculate."</p>

<p id="id00969">"Well, do calculate, my boy."</p>

<p id="id00970">"Nothing is easier," said I, putting down figures in my note book.
"Nine times a hundred and twenty-five feet gives a depth of eleven
hundred and twenty-five feet."</p>

<p id="id00971">"Very accurate indeed."</p>

<p id="id00972">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id00973">"By my observation we are at 10,000 feet below the level of the sea."</p>

<p id="id00974">"Is that possible?"</p>

<p id="id00975">"Yes, or figures are of no use."</p>

<p id="id00976">The Professor's calculations were quite correct. We had already
attained a depth of six thousand feet beyond that hitherto reached by
the foot of man, such as the mines of Kitz Bahl in Tyrol, and those
of Wuttembourg in Bohemia.</p>

<p id="id00977">The temperature, which ought to have been 81&#176; (178&#176; Fahr.) was
scarcely 15&#176; (59&#176; Fahr.). Here was cause for reflection.</p>

<h2 id="id00978" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3 id="id00979">GEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN SITU</h3>

<p id="id00980" style="margin-top: 2em">Next day, Tuesday, June 30, at 6 a.m., the descent began again.</p>

<p id="id00981">We were still following the gallery of lava, a real natural
staircase, and as gently sloping as those inclined planes which in
some old houses are still found instead of flights of steps. And so
we went on until 12.17, the, precise moment when we overtook Hans,
who had stopped.</p>

<p id="id00982">"Ah! here we are," exclaimed my uncle, "at the very end of the
chimney."</p>

<p id="id00983">I looked around me. We were standing at the intersection of two
roads, both dark and narrow. Which were we to take? This was a
difficulty.</p>

<p id="id00984">Still my uncle refused to admit an appearance of hesitation, either
before me or the guide; he pointed out the Eastern tunnel, and we
were soon all three in it.</p>

<p id="id00985">Besides there would have been interminable hesitation before this
choice of roads; for since there was no indication whatever to guide
our choice, we were obliged to trust to chance.</p>

<p id="id00986">The slope of this gallery was scarcely perceptible, and its sections
very unequal. Sometimes we passed a series of arches succeeding each
other like the majestic arcades of a gothic cathedral. Here the
architects of the middle ages might have found studies for every form
of the sacred art which sprang from the development of the pointed
arch. A mile farther we had to bow our heads under corniced elliptic
arches in the romanesque style; and massive pillars standing out from
the wall bent under the spring of the vault that rested heavily upon
them. In other places this magnificence gave way to narrow channels
between low structures which looked like beaver's huts, and we had to
creep along through extremely narrow passages.</p>

<p id="id00987">The heat was perfectly bearable. Involuntarily I began to think of
its heat when the lava thrown out by Sn&#230;fell was boiling and working
through this now silent road. I imagined the torrents of fire hurled
back at every angle in the gallery, and the accumulation of intensely
heated vapours in the midst of this confined channel.</p>

<p id="id00988">I only hope, thought I, that this so-called extinct volcano won't
take a fancy in his old age to begin his sports again!</p>

<p id="id00989">I abstained from communicating these fears to Professor Liedenbrock. He
would never have understood them at all. He had but one idea&#8212;forward!
He walked, he slid, he scrambled, he tumbled, with a persistency which
one could not but admire.</p>

<p id="id00990">By six in the evening, after a not very fatiguing walk, we had gone
two leagues south, but scarcely a quarter of a mile down.</p>

<p id="id00991">My uncle said it was time to go to sleep. We ate without talking, and
went to sleep without reflection.</p>

<p id="id00992">Our arrangements for the night were very simple; a railway rug each,
into which we rolled ourselves, was our sole covering. We had neither
cold nor intrusive visits to fear. Travellers who penetrate into the
wilds of central Africa, and into the pathless forests of the New
World, are obliged to watch over each other by night. But we enjoyed
absolute safety and utter seclusion; no savages or wild beasts
infested these silent depths.</p>

<p id="id00993">Next morning, we awoke fresh and in good spirits. The road was
resumed. As the day before, we followed the path of the lava. It was
impossible to tell what rocks we were passing: the tunnel, instead of
tending lower, approached more and more nearly to a horizontal
direction, I even fancied a slight rise. But about ten this upward
tendency became so evident, and therefore so fatiguing, that I was
obliged to slacken my pace.</p>

<p id="id00994">"Well, Axel?" demanded the Professor impatiently.</p>

<p id="id00995">"Well, I cannot stand it any longer," I replied.</p>

<p id="id00996">"What! after three hours' walk over such easy ground."</p>

<p id="id00997">"It may be easy, but it is tiring all the same."</p>

<p id="id00998">"What, when we have nothing to do but keep going down!"</p>

<p id="id00999">"Going up, if you please."</p>

<p id="id01000">"Going up!" said my uncle, with a shrug.</p>

<p id="id01001">"No doubt, for the last half-hour the inclines have gone the other
way, and at this rate we shall soon arrive upon the level soil of
Iceland."</p>

<p id="id01002">The Professor nodded slowly and uneasily like a man that declines to
be convinced. I tried to resume the conversation. He answered not a
word, and gave the signal for a start. I saw that his silence was
nothing but ill-humour.</p>

<p id="id01003">Still I had courageously shouldered my burden again, and was rapidly
following Hans, whom my uncle preceded. I was anxious not to be left
behind. My greatest care was not to lose sight of my companions. I
shuddered at the thought of being lost in the mazes of this vast
subterranean labyrinth.</p>

<p id="id01004">Besides, if the ascending road did become steeper, I was comforted
with the thought that it was bringing us nearer to the surface. There
was hope in this. Every step confirmed me in it, and I was rejoicing
at the thought of meeting my little Gr&#228;uben again.</p>

<p id="id01005">By mid-day there was a change in the appearance of this wall of the
gallery. I noticed it by a diminution of the amount of light
reflected from the sides; solid rock was appearing in the place of
the lava coating. The mass was composed of inclined and sometimes
vertical strata. We were passing through rocks of the transition or
silurian <a id="foot8" href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-3.html#id01017">[1]</a> system.</p>

<p id="id01006">"It is evident," I cried, "the marine deposits formed in the second
period, these shales, limestones, and sandstones. We are turning away
from the primary granite. We are just as if we were people of Hamburg
going to L&#252;beck by way of Hanover!"</p>

<p id="id01007">I had better have kept my observations to myself. But my geological
instinct was stronger than my prudence, and uncle Liedenbrock heard
my exclamation.</p>

<p id="id01008">"What's that you are saying?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id01009">"See," I said, pointing to the varied series of sandstones and
limestones, and the first indication of slate.</p>

<p id="id01010">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id01011">"We are at the period when the first plants and animals appeared."</p>

<p id="id01012">"Do you think so?"</p>

<p id="id01013">"Look close, and examine."</p>

<p id="id01014">I obliged the Professor to move his lamp over the walls of the
gallery. I expected some signs of astonishment; but he spoke not a
word, and went on.</p>

<p id="id01015">Had he understood me or not? Did he refuse to admit, out of self-love
as an uncle and a philosopher, that he had mistaken his way when he
chose the eastern tunnel? or was he determined to examine this
passage to its farthest extremity? It was evident that we had left
the lava path, and that this road could not possibly lead to the
extinct furnace of Sn&#230;fell.</p>

<p id="id01016">Yet I asked myself if I was not depending too much on this change in
the rock. Might I not myself be mistaken? Were we really crossing the
layers of rock which overlie the granite foundation?</p>

<p id="id01018">If I am right, I thought, I must soon find some fossil remains of
primitive life; and then we must yield to evidence. I will look.</p>

<p id="id01019">I had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented
themselves. It could not be otherwise, for in the Silurian age the
seas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species.
My feet, which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor,
suddenly rested upon a dust composed of the <i>debris</i> of plants and
shells. In the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and
lycopodites.</p>

<p id="id01020">Professor Liedenbrock could not be mistaken, I thought, and yet he
pushed on, with, I suppose, his eyes resolutely shut.</p>

<p id="id01021">This was only invincible obstinacy. I could hold out no longer. I
picked up a perfectly formed shell, which had belonged to an animal
not unlike the woodlouse: then, joining my uncle, I said:</p>

<p id="id01022">"Look at this!"</p>

<p id="id01023">"Very well," said he quietly, "it is the shell of a crustacean, of an
extinct species called a trilobite. Nothing more."</p>

<p id="id01024">"But don't you conclude&#8212;?"</p>

<p id="id01025">"Just what you conclude yourself. Yes; I do, perfectly. We have left
the granite and the lava. It is possible that I may be mistaken. But
I cannot be sure of that until I have reached the very end of this
gallery."</p>

<p id="id01026">"You are right in doing this, my uncle, and I should quite approve of
your determination, if there were not a danger threatening us nearer
and nearer."</p>

<p id="id01027">"What danger?"</p>

<p id="id01028">"The want of water."</p>

<p id="id01029">"Well, Axel, we will put ourselves upon rations."</p>

<hr>
<p id="id01017"><a href="a-journey-into-the-interior-of-the-earth-3.html#foot8">[1]</a>The name given by Sir Roderick Murchison to a vast series of
fossiliferous strata, which lies between the non-fossiliferous slaty
schists below and the old red sandstone above. The system is well
developed in the region of Shropshire, etc., once inhabited by the
Silures under Caractacus, or Caradoc. (Tr.)</p>

<h2 id="id01030" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3 id="id01031">THE FIRST SIGNS OF DISTRESS</h3>

<p id="id01032" style="margin-top: 2em">In fact, we had to ration ourselves. Our provision of water could not
last more than three days. I found that out for certain when
supper-time came. And, to our sorrow, we had little reason to expect
to find a spring in these transition beds.</p>

<p id="id01033">The whole of the next day the gallery opened before us its endless
arcades. We moved on almost without a word. Hans' silence seemed to
be infecting us.</p>

<p id="id01034">The road was now not ascending, at least not perceptibly. Sometimes,
even, it seemed to have a slight fall. But this tendency, which was
very trifling, could not do anything to reassure the Professor; for
there was no change in the beds, and the transitional characteristics
became more and more decided.</p>

<p id="id01035">The electric light was reflected in sparkling splendour from the
schist, limestone, and old red sandstone of the walls. It might have
been thought that we were passing through a section of Wales, of
which an ancient people gave its name to this system. Specimens of
magnificent marbles clothed the walls, some of a greyish agate
fantastically veined with white, others of rich crimson or yellow
dashed with splotches of red; then came dark cherry-coloured marbles
relieved by the lighter tints of limestone.</p>

<p id="id01036">The greater part of these bore impressions of primitive organisms.
Creation had evidently advanced since the day before. Instead of
rudimentary trilobites, I noticed remains of a more perfect order of
beings, amongst others ganoid fishes and some of those sauroids in
which palaeontologists have discovered the earliest reptile forms.
The Devonian seas were peopled by animals of these species, and
deposited them by thousands in the rocks of the newer formation.</p>

<p id="id01037">It was evident that we were ascending that scale of animal life in
which man fills the highest place. But Professor Liedenbrock seemed
not to notice it.</p>

<p id="id01038">He was awaiting one of two events, either the appearance of a
vertical well opening before his feet, down which our descent might
be resumed, or that of some obstacle which should effectually turn us
back on our own footsteps. But evening came and neither wish was
gratified.</p>

<p id="id01039">On Friday, after a night during which I felt pangs of thirst, our
little troop again plunged into the winding passages of the gallery.</p>

<p id="id01040">After ten hours' walking I observed a singular deadening of the
reflection of our lamps from the side walls. The marble, the schist,
the limestone, and the sandstone were giving way to a dark and
lustreless lining. At one moment, the tunnel becoming very narrow, I
leaned against the wall.</p>

<p id="id01041">When I removed my hand it was black. I looked nearer, and found we
were in a coal formation.</p>

<p id="id01042">"A coal mine!" I cried.</p>

<p id="id01043">"A mine without miners," my uncle replied.</p>

<p id="id01044">"Who knows?" I asked.</p>

<p id="id01045">"I know," the Professor pronounced decidedly, "I am certain that this
gallery driven through beds of coal was never pierced by the hand of
man. But whether it be the hand of nature or not does not matter.
Supper time is come; let us sup."</p>

<p id="id01046">Hans prepared some food. I scarcely ate, and I swallowed down the few
drops of water rationed out to me. One flask half full was all we had
left to slake the thirst of three men.</p>

<p id="id01047">After their meal my two companions laid themselves down upon their
rugs, and found in sleep a solace for their fatigue. But I could not
sleep, and I counted every hour until morning.</p>

<p id="id01048">On Saturday, at six, we started afresh. In twenty minutes we reached
a vast open space; I then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed
out this mine; the vaults would have been shored up, and, as it was,
they seemed to be held up by a miracle of equilibrium.</p>

<p id="id01049">This cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in
height. A large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean
disturbance. Yielding to some vast power from below it had broken
asunder, leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now
penetrating for the first time.</p>

<p id="id01050">The whole history of the carboniferous period was written upon these
gloomy walls, and a geologist might with ease trace all its diverse
phases. The beds of coal were separated by strata of sandstone or
compact clays, and appeared crushed under the weight of overlying
strata.</p>

<p id="id01051">At the age of the world which preceded the secondary period, the
earth was clothed with immense vegetable forms, the product of the
double influence of tropical heat and constant moisture; a vapoury
atmosphere surrounded the earth, still veiling the direct rays of the
sun.</p>

<p id="id01052">Thence arises the conclusion that the high temperature then existing
was due to some other source than the heat of the sun. Perhaps even
the orb of day may not have been ready yet to play the splendid part
he now acts. There were no 'climates' as yet, and a torrid heat,
equal from pole to equator, was spread over the whole surface of the
globe. Whence this heat? Was it from the interior of the earth?</p>

<p id="id01053">Notwithstanding the theories of Professor Liedenbrock, a violent heat
did at that time brood within the body of the spheroid. Its action
was felt to the very last coats of the terrestrial crust; the plants,
unacquainted with the beneficent influences of the sun, yielded
neither flowers nor scent. But their roots drew vigorous life from
the burning soil of the early days of this planet.</p>

<p id="id01054">There were but few trees. Herbaceous plants alone existed. There were
tall grasses, ferns, lycopods, besides sigillaria, asterophyllites,
now scarce plants, but then the species might be counted by thousands.</p>

<p id="id01055">The coal measures owe their origin to this period of profuse
vegetation. The yet elastic and yielding crust of the earth obeyed
the fluid forces beneath. Thence innumerable fissures and
depressions. The plants, sunk underneath the waters, formed by
degrees into vast accumulated masses.</p>

<p id="id01056">Then came the chemical action of nature; in the depths of the seas
the vegetable accumulations first became peat; then, acted upon by
generated gases and the heat of fermentation, they underwent a
process of complete mineralization.</p>

<p id="id01057">Thus were formed those immense coalfields, which nevertheless, are
not inexhaustible, and which three centuries at the present
accelerated rate of consumption will exhaust unless the industrial
world will devise a remedy.</p>

<p id="id01058">These reflections came into my mind whilst I was contemplating the
mineral wealth stored up in this portion of the globe. These no
doubt, I thought, will never be discovered; the working of such deep
mines would involve too large an outlay, and where would be the use
as long as coal is yet spread far and wide near the surface? Such as
my eyes behold these virgin stores, such they will be when this world
comes to an end.</p>

<p id="id01059">But still we marched on, and I alone was forgetting the length of the
way by losing myself in the midst of geological contemplations. The
temperature remained what it had been during our passage through the
lava and schists. Only my sense of smell was forcibly affected by an
odour of protocarburet of hydrogen. I immediately recognised in this
gallery the presence of a considerable quantity of the dangerous gas
called by miners firedamp, the explosion of which has often
occasioned such dreadful catastrophes.</p>

<p id="id01060">Happily, our light was from Ruhmkorff's ingenious apparatus. If
unfortunately we had explored this gallery with torches, a terrible
explosion would have put an end to travelling and travellers at one
stroke.</p>

<p id="id01061">This excursion through the coal mine lasted till night. My uncle
scarcely could restrain his impatience at the horizontal road. The
darkness, always deep twenty yards before us, prevented us from
estimating the length of the gallery; and I was beginning to think it
must be endless, when suddenly at six o'clock a wall very
unexpectedly stood before us. Right or left, top or bottom, there was
no road farther; we were at the end of a blind alley. "Very well,
it's all right!" cried my uncle, "now, at any rate, we shall know
what we are about. We are not in Saknussemm's road, and all we have
to do is to go back. Let us take a night's rest, and in three days we
shall get to the fork in the road." "Yes," said I, "if we have any
strength left." "Why not?" "Because to-morrow we shall have no
water." "Nor courage either?" asked my uncle severely. I dared make
no answer.</p>

<h3 id="id01063">COMPASSION FUSES THE PROFESSOR'S HEART</h3>

<p id="id01064" style="margin-top: 2em">Next day we started early. We had to hasten forward. It was a three
days' march to the cross roads.</p>

<p id="id01065">I will not speak of the sufferings we endured in our return. My uncle
bore them with the angry impatience of a man obliged to own his
weakness; Hans with the resignation of his passive nature; I, I
confess, with complaints and expressions of despair. I had no spirit
to oppose this ill fortune.</p>

<p id="id01066">As I had foretold, the water failed entirely by the end of the first
day's retrograde march. Our fluid aliment was now nothing but gin;
but this infernal fluid burned my throat, and I could not even endure
the sight of it. I found the temperature and the air stifling.
Fatigue paralysed my limbs. More than once I dropped down motionless.
Then there was a halt; and my uncle and the Icelander did their best
to restore me. But I saw that the former was struggling painfully
against excessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst.</p>

<p id="id01067">At last, on Tuesday, July 8, we arrived on our hands and knees, and
half dead, at the junction of the two roads. There I dropped like a
lifeless lump, extended on the lava soil. It was ten in the morning.</p>

<p id="id01068">Hans and my uncle, clinging to the wall, tried to nibble a few bits
of biscuit. Long moans escaped from my swollen lips.</p>

<p id="id01069">After some time my uncle approached me and raised me in his arms.</p>

<p id="id01070">"Poor boy!" said he, in genuine tones of compassion.</p>

<p id="id01071">I was touched with these words, not being accustomed to see the
excitable Professor in a softened mood. I grasped his trembling hands
in mine. He let me hold them and looked at me. His eyes were
moistened.</p>

<p id="id01072">Then I saw him take the flask that was hanging at his side. To my
amazement he placed it on my lips.</p>

<p id="id01073">"Drink!" said he.</p>

<p id="id01074">Had I heard him? Was my uncle beside himself? I stared at, him
stupidly, and felt as if I could not understand him.</p>

<p id="id01075">"Drink!" he said again.</p>

<p id="id01076">And raising his flask he emptied it every drop between my lips.</p>

<p id="id01077">Oh! infinite pleasure! a slender sip of water came to moisten my
burning mouth. It was but one sip but it was enough to recall my
ebbing life.</p>

<p id="id01078">I thanked my uncle with clasped hands.</p>

<p id="id01079">"Yes," he said, "a draught of water; but it is the very last&#8212;you
hear!&#8212;the last. I had kept it as a precious treasure at the bottom
of my flask. Twenty times, nay, a hundred times, have I fought
against a frightful impulse to drink it off. But no, Axel, I kept it
for you."</p>

<p id="id01080">"My dear uncle," I said, whilst hot tears trickled down my face.</p>

<p id="id01081">"Yes, my poor boy, I knew that as soon as you arrived at these cross
roads you would drop half dead, and I kept my last drop of water to
reanimate you."</p>

<p id="id01082">"Thank you, thank you," I said. Although my thirst was only partially
quenched, yet some strength had returned. The muscles of my throat,
until then contracted, now relaxed again; and the inflammation of my
lips abated somewhat; and I was now able to speak. .</p>

<p id="id01083">"Let us see," I said, "we have now but one thing to do. We have no
water; we must go back."</p>

<p id="id01084">While I spoke my uncle avoided looking at me; he hung his head down;
his eyes avoided mine.</p>

<p id="id01085">"We must return," I exclaimed vehemently; "we must go back on our way
to Sn&#230;fell. May God give us strength to climb up the crater again!"</p>

<p id="id01086">"Return!" said my uncle, as if he was rather answering himself than
me.</p>

<p id="id01087">"Yes, return, without the loss of a minute."</p>

<p id="id01088">A long silence followed.</p>

<p id="id01089">"So then, Axel," replied the Professor ironically, "you have found no
courage or energy in these few drops of water?"</p>

<p id="id01090">"Courage?"</p>

<p id="id01091">"I see you just as feeble-minded as you were before, and still
expressing only despair!"</p>

<p id="id01092">What sort of a man was this I had to do with, and what schemes was he
now revolving in his fearless mind?</p>

<p id="id01093">"What! you won't go back?"</p>

<p id="id01094">"Should I renounce this expedition just when we have the fairest
chance of success! Never!"</p>

<p id="id01095">"Then must we resign ourselves to destruction?"</p>

<p id="id01096">"No, Axel, no; go back. Hans will go with you. Leave me to myself!"</p>

<p id="id01097">"Leave you here!"</p>

<p id="id01098">"Leave me, I tell you. I have undertaken this expedition. I will
carry it out to the end, and I will not return. Go, Axel, go!"</p>

<p id="id01099">My uncle was in high state of excitement. His voice, which had for a
moment been tender and gentle, had now become hard and threatening.
He was struggling with gloomy resolutions against impossibilities. I
would not leave him in this bottomless abyss, and on the other hand
the instinct of self-preservation prompted me to fly.</p>

<p id="id01100">The guide watched this scene with his usual phlegmatic unconcern. Yet
he understood perfectly well what was going on between his two
companions. The gestures themselves were sufficient to show that we
were each bent on taking a different road; but Hans seemed to take no
part in a question upon which depended his life. He was ready to
start at a given signal, or to stay, if his master so willed it.</p>

<p id="id01101">How I wished at this moment I could have made him understand me. My
words, my complaints, my sorrow would have had some influence over
that frigid nature. Those dangers which our guide could not
understand I could have demonstrated and proved to him. Together we
might have over-ruled the obstinate Professor; if it were needed, we
might perhaps have compelled him to regain the heights of Sn&#230;fell.</p>

<p id="id01102">I drew near to Hans. I placed my hand upon his. He made no movement.
My parted lips sufficiently revealed my sufferings. The Icelander
slowly moved his head, and calmly pointing to my uncle said:</p>

<p id="id01103">"Master."</p>

<p id="id01104">"Master!" I shouted; "you madman! no, he is not the master of our
life; we must fly, we must drag him. Do you hear me? Do you
understand?"</p>

<p id="id01105">I had seized Hans by the arm. I wished to oblige him to rise. I
strove with him. My uncle interposed.</p>

<p id="id01106">"Be calm, Axel! you will get nothing from that immovable servant.<br>

Therefore, listen to my proposal."<br></p>

<p id="id01107">I crossed my arms, and confronted my uncle boldly.</p>

<p id="id01108">"The want of water," he said, "is the only obstacle in our way. In
this eastern gallery made up of lavas, schists, and coal, we have not
met with a single particle of moisture. Perhaps we shall be more
fortunate if we follow the western tunnel."</p>

<p id="id01109">I shook my head incredulously.</p>

<p id="id01110">"Hear me to the end," the Professor went on with a firm voice.
"Whilst you were lying there motionless, I went to examine the
conformation of that gallery. It penetrates directly downward, and in
a few hours it will bring us to the granite rocks. There we must meet
with abundant springs. The nature of the rock assures me of this, and
instinct agrees with logic to support my conviction. Now, this is my
proposal. When Columbus asked of his ships' crews for three days more
to discover a new world, those crews, disheartened and sick as they
were, recognised the justice of the claim, and he discovered America.
I am the Columbus of this nether world, and I only ask for one more
day. If in a single day I have not met with the water that we want, I
swear to you we will return to the surface of the earth."</p>

<p id="id01111">In spite of my irritation I was moved with these words, as well as
with the violence my uncle was doing to his own wishes in making so
hazardous a proposal.</p>

<p id="id01112">"Well," I said, "do as you will, and God reward your superhuman
energy. You have now but a few hours to tempt fortune. Let us start!"</p>

<h2 id="id01113" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3 id="id01114">TOTAL FAILURE OF WATER</h3>

<p id="id01115" style="margin-top: 2em">This time the descent commenced by the new gallery. Hans walked first
as was his custom.</p>

<p id="id01116">We had not gone a hundred yards when the Professor, moving his
lantern along the walls, cried:</p>

<p id="id01117">"Here are primitive rocks. Now we are in the right way. Forward!"</p>

<p id="id01118">When in its early stages the earth was slowly cooling, its
contraction gave rise in its crust to disruptions, distortions,
fissures, and chasms. The passage through which we were moving was
such a fissure, through which at one time granite poured out in a
molten state. Its thousands of windings formed an inextricable
labyrinth through the primeval mass.</p>

<p id="id01119">As fast as we descended, the succession of beds forming the primitive
foundation came out with increasing distinctness. Geologists consider
this primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the
earth, and have ascertained it to be composed of three different
formations, schist, gneiss, and mica schist, resting upon that
unchangeable foundation, the granite.</p>

<p id="id01120">Never had mineralogists found themselves in so marvellous a situation
to study nature in situ. What the boring machine, an insensible,
inert instrument, was unable to bring to the surface of the inner
structure of the globe, we were able to peruse with our own eyes and
handle with our own hands.</p>

<p id="id01121">Through the beds of schist, coloured with delicate shades of green,
ran in winding course threads of copper and manganese, with traces of
platinum and gold. I thought, what riches are here buried at an
unapproachable depth in the earth, hidden for ever from the covetous
eyes of the human race! These treasures have been buried at such a
profound depth by the convulsions of primeval times that they run no
chance of ever being molested by the pickaxe or the spade.</p>

<p id="id01122">To the schists succeeded gneiss, partially stratified, remarkable for
the parallelism and regularity of its lamina, then mica schists, laid
in large plates or flakes, revealing their lamellated structure by
the sparkle of the white shining mica.</p>

<p id="id01123">The light from our apparatus, reflected from the small facets of
quartz, shot sparkling rays at every angle, and I seemed to be moving
through a diamond, within which the quickly darting rays broke across
each other in a thousand flashing coruscations.</p>

<p id="id01124">About six o'clock this brilliant fete of illuminations underwent a
sensible abatement of splendour, then almost ceased. The walls
assumed a crystallised though sombre appearance; mica was more
closely mingled with the feldspar and quartz to form the proper rocky
foundations of the earth, which bears without distortion or crushing
the weight of the four terrestrial systems. We were immured within
prison walls of granite.</p>

<p id="id01125">It was eight in the evening. No signs of water had yet appeared. I
was suffering horribly. My uncle strode on. He refused to stop. He
was listening anxiously for the murmur of distant springs. But, no,
there was dead silence.</p>

<p id="id01126">And now my limbs were failing beneath me. I resisted pain and
torture, that I might not stop my uncle, which would have driven him
to despair, for the day was drawing near to its end, and it was his
last.</p>

<p id="id01127">At last I failed utterly; I uttered a cry and fell.</p>

<p id="id01128">"Come to me, I am dying."</p>

<p id="id01129">My uncle retraced his steps. He gazed upon me with his arms crossed;
then these muttered words passed his lips:</p>

<p id="id01130">"It's all over!"</p>

<p id="id01131">The last thing I saw was a fearful gesture of rage, and my eyes
closed.</p>

<p id="id01132">When I reopened them I saw my two companions motionless and rolled up
in their coverings. Were they asleep? As for me, I could not get one
moment's sleep. I was suffering too keenly, and what embittered my
thoughts was that there was no remedy. My uncle's last words echoed
painfully in my ears: "it's all over!" For in such a fearful state of
debility it was madness to think of ever reaching the upper world
again.</p>

<p id="id01133">We had above us a league and a half of terrestrial crust. The weight
of it seemed to be crushing down upon my shoulders. I felt weighed
down, and I exhausted myself with imaginary violent exertions to turn
round upon my granite couch.</p>

<p id="id01134">A few hours passed away. A deep silence reigned around us, the
silence of the grave. No sound could reach us through walls, the
thinnest of which were five miles thick.</p>

<p id="id01135">Yet in the midst of my stupefaction I seemed to be aware of a noise.
It was dark down the tunnel, but I seemed to see the Icelander
vanishing from our sight with the lamp in his hand.</p>

<p id="id01136">Why was he leaving us? Was Hans going to forsake us? My uncle was
fast asleep. I wanted to shout, but my voice died upon my parched and
swollen lips. The darkness became deeper, and the last sound died
away in the far distance.</p>

<p id="id01137">"Hans has abandoned us," I cried. "Hans! Hans!"</p>

<p id="id01138">But these words were only spoken within me. They went no farther. Yet
after the first moment of terror I felt ashamed of suspecting a man
of such extraordinary faithfulness. Instead of ascending he was
descending the gallery. An evil design would have taken him up not
down. This reflection restored me to calmness, and I turned to other
thoughts. None but some weighty motive could have induced so quiet a
man to forfeit his sleep. Was he on a journey of discovery? Had he
during the silence of the night caught a sound, a murmuring of
something in the distance, which had failed to affect my hearing?</p>

<h2 id="id01139" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3 id="id01140">WATER DISCOVERED</h3>

<p id="id01141" style="margin-top: 2em">For a whole hour I was trying to work out in my delirious brain the
reasons which might have influenced this seemingly tranquil huntsman.
The absurdest notions ran in utter confusion through my mind. I
thought madness was coming on!</p>

<p id="id01142">But at last a noise of footsteps was heard in the dark abyss. Hans
was approaching. A flickering light was beginning to glimmer on the
wall of our darksome prison; then it came out full at the mouth of
the gallery. Hans appeared.</p>

<p id="id01143">He drew close to my uncle, laid his hand upon his shoulder, and
gently woke him. My uncle rose up.</p>

<p id="id01144">"What is the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id01145">"<i>Watten!</i>" replied the huntsman.</p>

<p id="id01146">No doubt under the inspiration of intense pain everybody becomes
endowed with the gift of divers tongues. I did not know a word of
Danish, yet instinctively I understood the word he had uttered.</p>

<p id="id01147">"Water! water!" I cried, clapping my hands and gesticulating like a
madman.</p>

<p id="id01148">"Water!" repeated my uncle. "Hvar?" he asked, in Icelandic.</p>

<p id="id01149">"<i>Nedat,</i>" replied Hans.</p>

<p id="id01150">"Where? Down below!" I understood it all. I seized the hunter's
hands, and pressed them while he looked on me without moving a muscle
of his countenance.</p>

<p id="id01151">The preparations for our departure were not long in making, and we
were soon on our way down a passage inclining two feet in seven. In
an hour we had gone a mile and a quarter, and descended two thousand
feet.</p>

<p id="id01152">Then I began to hear distinctly quite a new sound of something
running within the thickness of the granite wall, a kind of dull,
dead rumbling, like distant thunder. During the first part of our
walk, not meeting with the promised spring, I felt my agony
returning; but then my uncle acquainted me with the cause of the
strange noise.</p>

<p id="id01153">"Hans was not mistaken," he said. "What you hear is the rushing of a
torrent."</p>

<p id="id01154">"A torrent?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01155">"There can be no doubt; a subterranean river is flowing around us."</p>

<p id="id01156">We hurried forward in the greatest excitement. I was no longer
sensible of my fatigue. This murmuring of waters close at hand was
already refreshing me. It was audibly increasing. The torrent, after
having for some time flowed over our heads, was now running within
the left wall, roaring and rushing. Frequently I touched the wall,
hoping to feel some indications of moisture: But there was no hope
here.</p>

<p id="id01157">Yet another half hour, another half league was passed.</p>

<p id="id01158">Then it became clear that the hunter had gone no farther. Guided by
an instinct peculiar to mountaineers he had as it were felt this
torrent through the rock; but he had certainly seen none of the
precious liquid; he had drunk nothing himself.</p>

<p id="id01159">Soon it became evident that if we continued our walk we should widen
the distance between ourselves and the stream, the noise of which was
becoming fainter.</p>

<p id="id01160">We returned. Hans stopped where the torrent seemed closest. I sat
near the wall, while the waters were flowing past me at a distance of
two feet with extreme violence. But there was a thick granite wall
between us and the object of our desires.</p>

<p id="id01161">Without reflection, without asking if there were any means of
procuring the water, I gave way to a movement of despair.</p>

<p id="id01162">Hans glanced at me with, I thought, a smile of compassion.</p>

<p id="id01163">He rose and took the lamp. I followed him. He moved towards the wall.
I looked on. He applied his ear against the dry stone, and moved it
slowly to and fro, listening intently. I perceived at once that he
was examining to find the exact place where the torrent could be
heard the loudest. He met with that point on the left side of the
tunnel, at three feet from the ground.</p>

<p id="id01164">I was stirred up with excitement. I hardly dared guess what the
hunter was about to do. But I could not but understand, and applaud
and cheer him on, when I saw him lay hold of the pickaxe to make an
attack upon the rock.</p>

<p id="id01165">"We are saved!" I cried.</p>

<p id="id01166">"Yes," cried my uncle, almost frantic with excitement. "Hans is
right. Capital fellow! Who but he would have thought of it?"</p>

<p id="id01167">Yes; who but he? Such an expedient, however simple, would never have
entered into our minds. True, it seemed most hazardous to strike a
blow of the hammer in this part of the earth's structure. Suppose
some displacement should occur and crush us all! Suppose the torrent,
bursting through, should drown us in a sudden flood! There was
nothing vain in these fancies. But still no fears of falling rocks or
rushing floods could stay us now; and our thirst was so intense that,
to satisfy it, we would have dared the waves of the north Atlantic.</p>

<p id="id01168">Hans set about the task which my uncle and I together could not have
accomplished. If our impatience had armed our hands with power, we
should have shattered the rock into a thousand fragments. Not so
Hans. Full of self possession, he calmly wore his way through the
rock with a steady succession of light and skilful strokes, working
through an aperture six inches wide at the outside. I could hear a
louder noise of flowing waters, and I fancied I could feel the
delicious fluid refreshing my parched lips.</p>

<p id="id01169">The pick had soon penetrated two feet into the granite partition, and
our man had worked for above an hour. I was in an agony of
impatience. My uncle wanted to employ stronger measures, and I had
some difficulty in dissuading him; still he had just taken a pickaxe
in his hand, when a sudden hissing was heard, and a jet of water
spurted out with violence against the opposite wall.</p>

<p id="id01170">Hans, almost thrown off his feet by the violence of the shock,
uttered a cry of grief and disappointment, of which I soon under-.
stood the cause, when plunging my hands into the spouting torrent, I
withdrew them in haste, for the water was scalding hot.</p>

<p id="id01171">"The water is at the boiling point," I cried.</p>

<p id="id01172">"Well, never mind, let it cool," my uncle replied.</p>

<p id="id01173">The tunnel was filling with steam, whilst a stream was forming, which
by degrees wandered away into subterranean windings, and soon we had
the satisfaction of swallowing our first draught.</p>

<p id="id01174">Could anything be more delicious than the sensation that our burning
intolerable thirst was passing away, and leaving us to enjoy comfort
and pleasure? But where was this water from? No matter. It was water;
and though still warm, it brought life back to the dying. I kept
drinking without stopping, and almost without tasting.</p>

<p id="id01175">At last after a most delightful time of reviving energy, I cried,<br>

"Why, this is a chalybeate spring!"<br></p>

<p id="id01176">"Nothing could be better for the digestion," said my uncle. "It is
highly impregnated with iron. It will be as good for us as going to
the Spa, or to T&#246;plitz."</p>

<p id="id01177">"Well, it is delicious!"</p>

<p id="id01178">"Of course it is, water should be, found six miles underground. It
has an inky flavour, which is not at all unpleasant. What a capital
source of strength Hans has found for us here. We will call it after
his name."</p>

<p id="id01179">"Agreed," I cried.</p>

<p id="id01180">And Hansbach it was from that moment.</p>

<p id="id01181">Hans was none the prouder. After a moderate draught, he went quietly
into a corner to rest.</p>

<p id="id01182">"Now," I said, "we must not lose this water."</p>

<p id="id01183">"What is the use of troubling ourselves?" my uncle, replied. "I fancy
it will never fail."</p>

<p id="id01184">"Never mind, we cannot be sure; let us fill the water bottle and our
flasks, and then stop up the opening."</p>

<p id="id01185">My advice was followed so far as getting in a supply; but the
stopping up of the hole was not so easy to accomplish. It was in vain
that we took up fragments of granite, and stuffed them in with tow,
we only scalded our hands without succeeding. The pressure was too
great, and our efforts were fruitless.</p>

<p id="id01186">"It is quite plain," said I, "that the higher body of this water is
at a considerable elevation. The force of the jet shows that."</p>

<p id="id01187">"No doubt," answered my uncle. "If this column of water is 32,000
feet high&#8212;that is, from the surface of the earth, it is equal to
the weight of a thousand atmospheres. But I have got an idea."</p>

<p id="id01188">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id01189">"Why should we trouble ourselves to stop the stream from coming out
at all?"</p>

<p id="id01190">"Because&#8212;" Well, I could not assign a reason.</p>

<p id="id01191">"When our flasks are empty, where shall we fill them again? Can we
tell that?"</p>

<p id="id01192">No; there was no certainty.</p>

<p id="id01193">"Well, let us allow the water to run on. It will flow down, and will
both guide and refresh us."</p>

<p id="id01194">"That is well planned," I cried. "With this stream for our guide,
there is no reason why we should not succeed in our undertaking."</p>

<p id="id01195">"Ah, my boy! you agree with me now," cried the Professor, laughing.</p>

<p id="id01196">"I agree with you most heartily."</p>

<p id="id01197">"Well, let us rest awhile; and then we will start again."</p>

<p id="id01198">I was forgetting that it was night. The chronometer soon informed me
of that fact; and in a very short time, refreshed and thankful, we
all three fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<h2 id="id01199" style="margin-top: 4em">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3 id="id01200">WELL SAID, OLD MOLE! CANST THOU WORK I' THE GROUND SO FAST?</h3>

<p id="id01201" style="margin-top: 2em">By the next day we had forgotten all our sufferings. At first, I was
wondering that I was no longer thirsty, and I was for asking for the
reason. The answer came in the murmuring of the stream at my feet.</p>

<p id="id01202">We breakfasted, and drank of this excellent chalybeate water. I felt
wonderfully stronger, and quite decided upon pushing on. Why should
not so firmly convinced a man as my uncle, furnished with so
industrious a guide as Hans, and accompanied by so determined a
nephew as myself, go on to final success? Such were the magnificent
plans which struggled for mastery within me. If it had been proposed
to me to return to the summit of Sn&#230;fell, I should have indignantly
declined.</p>

<p id="id01203">Most fortunately, all we had to do was to descend.</p>

<p id="id01204">"Let us start!" I cried, awakening by my shouts the echoes of the
vaulted hollows of the earth.</p>

<p id="id01205">On Thursday, at 8 a.m., we started afresh. The granite tunnel winding
from side to side, earned us past unexpected turns, and seemed almost
to form a labyrinth; but, on the whole, its direction seemed to be
south-easterly. My uncle never ceased to consult his compass, to keep
account of the ground gone over.</p>

<p id="id01206">The gallery dipped down a very little way from the horizontal,
scarcely more than two inches in a fathom, and the stream ran gently
murmuring at our feet. I compared it to a friendly genius guiding us
underground, and caressed with my hand the soft naiad, whose
comforting voice accompanied our steps. With my reviving spirits
these mythological notions seemed to come unbidden.</p>

<p id="id01207">As for my uncle, he was beginning to storm against the horizontal
road. He loved nothing better than a vertical path; but this way
seemed indefinitely prolonged, and instead of sliding along the
hypothenuse as we were now doing, he would willingly have dropped
down the terrestrial radius. But there was no help for it, and as
long as we were approaching the centre at all we felt that we must
not complain.</p>

<p id="id01208">From time to time, a steeper path appeared; our naiad then began to
tumble before us with a hoarser murmur, and we went down with her to
a greater depth.</p>

<p id="id01209">On the whole, that day and the next we made considerable way
horizontally, very little vertically.</p>

<p id="id01210">On Friday evening, the 10th of July, according to our calculations,
we were thirty leagues south-east of Rejkiavik, and at a depth of two
leagues and a half.</p>

<p id="id01211">At our feet there now opened a frightful abyss. My uncle, however,
was not to be daunted, and he clapped his hands at the steepness of
the descent.</p>

<p id="id01212">"This will take us a long way," he cried, "and without much
difficulty; for the projections in the rock form quite a staircase."</p>

<p id="id01213">The ropes were so fastened by Hans as to guard against accident, and
the descent commenced. I can hardly call it perilous, for I was
beginning to be familiar with this kind of exercise.</p>

<p id="id01214">This well, or abyss, was a narrow cleft in the mass of the granite,
called by geologists a 'fault,' and caused by the unequal cooling of
the globe of the earth. If it had at one time been a passage for
eruptive matter thrown out by Sn&#230;fell, I still could not understand
why no trace was left of its passage. We kept going down a kind of
winding staircase, which seemed almost to have been made by the hand
of man.</p>

<p id="id01215">Every quarter of an hour we were obliged to halt, to take a little
necessary repose and restore the action of our limbs. We then sat
down upon a fragment of rock, and we talked as we ate and drank from
the stream.</p>

<p id="id01216">Of course, down this fault the Hansbach fell in a cascade, and lost
some of its volume; but there was enough and to spare to slake our
thirst. Besides, when the incline became more gentle, it would of
course resume its peaceable course. At this moment it reminded me of
my worthy uncle, in his frequent fits of impatience and anger, while
below it ran with the calmness of the Icelandic hunter.</p>

<p id="id01217">On the 6th and 7th of July we kept following the spiral curves of
this singular well, penetrating in actual distance no more than two
leagues; but being carried to a depth of five leagues below the level
of the sea. But on the 8th, about noon, the fault took, towards the
south-east, a much gentler slope, one of about forty-five degrees.</p>

<p id="id01218">Then the road became monotonously easy. It could not be otherwise,
for there was no landscape to vary the stages of our journey.</p>

<p id="id01219">On Wednesday, the 15th, we were seven leagues underground, and had
travelled fifty leagues away from Sn&#230;fell. Although we were tired,
our health was perfect, and the medicine chest had not yet had
occasion to be opened.</p>

<p id="id01220">My uncle noted every hour the indications of the compass, the
chronometer, the aneroid, and the thermometer the very same which he
has published in his scientific report of our journey. It was
therefore not difficult to know exactly our whereabouts. When he told
me that we had gone fifty leagues horizontally, I could not repress
an exclamation of astonishment, at the thought that we had now long
left Iceland behind us.</p>

<p id="id01221">"What is the matter?" he cried.</p>

<p id="id01222">"I was reflecting that if your calculations are correct we are no
longer under Iceland."</p>

<p id="id01223">"Do you think so?"</p>

<p id="id01224">"I am not mistaken," I said, and examining the map, I added, "We have
passed Cape Portland, and those fifty leagues bring us under the wide
expanse of ocean."</p>

<p id="id01225">"Under the sea," my uncle repeated, rubbing his hands with delight.</p>

<p id="id01226">"Can it be?" I said. "Is the ocean spread above our heads?"</p>

<p id="id01227">"Of course, Axel. What can be more natural? At Newcastle are there
not coal mines extending far under the sea?"</p>

<p id="id01228">It was all very well for the Professor to call this so simple, but I
could not feel quite easy at the thought that the boundless ocean was
rolling over my head. And yet it really mattered very little whether
it was the plains and mountains that covered our heads, or the
Atlantic waves, as long as we were arched over by solid granite. And,
besides, I was getting used to this idea; for the tunnel, now running
straight, now winding as capriciously in its inclines as in its
turnings, but constantly preserving its south-easterly direction, and
always running deeper, was gradually carrying us to very great depths
indeed.</p>

<p id="id01229">Four days later, Saturday, the 18th of July, in the evening, we
arrived at a kind of vast grotto; and here my uncle paid Hans his
weekly wages, and it was settled that the next day, Sunday, should be
a day of rest.</p>
