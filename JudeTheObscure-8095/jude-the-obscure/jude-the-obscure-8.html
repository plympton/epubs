<p>"He's waiting to, any day," returned Sue, with frigid pride.</p>
<p>"Then let him, in Heaven's name. Life with a man is more businesslike after it, and money matters work better. And then, you see, if you have rows, and he turns you out of doors, you can get the law to protect you, which you can't otherwise, unless he half-runs you through with a knife, or cracks your noddle with a poker. And if he bolts away from you&#8212;I say it friendly, as woman to woman, for there's never any knowing what a man med do&#8212;you'll have the sticks o' furniture, and won't be looked upon as a thief. I shall marry my man over again, now he's willing, as there was a little flaw in the first ceremony. In my telegram last night which this is an answer to, I told him I had almost made it up with Jude; and that frightened him, I expect! Perhaps I should quite have done it if it hadn't been for you," she said laughing; "and then how different our histories might have been from to-day! Never such a tender fool as Jude is if a woman seems in trouble, and coaxes him a bit! Just as he used to be about birds and things. However, as it happens, it is just as well as if I had made it up, and I forgive you. And, as I say, I'd advise you to get the business legally done as soon as possible. You'll find it an awful bother later on if you don't."</p>
<p>"I have told you he is asking me to marry him&#8212;to make our natural marriage a legal one," said Sue, with yet more dignity. "It was quite by my wish that he didn't the moment I was free."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes&#8212;you are a oneyer too, like myself," said Arabella, eyeing her visitor with humorous criticism. "Bolted from your first, didn't you, like me?"</p>
<p>"Good morning!&#8212;I must go," said Sue hastily.</p>
<p>"And I, too, must up and off!" replied the other, springing out of bed so suddenly that the soft parts of her person shook. Sue jumped aside in trepidation. "Lord, I am only a woman&#8212;not a six-foot sojer! &#8230; Just a moment, dear," she continued, putting her hand on Sue's arm. "I really did want to consult Jude on a little matter of business, as I told him. I came about that more than anything else. Would he run up to speak to me at the station as I am going? You think not. Well, I'll write to him about it. I didn't want to write it, but never mind&#8212;I will."</p>
<p>&#160;<a id="id_5-3"></a><br/>
&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00050">III</h2>
<p>When Sue reached home Jude was awaiting her at the door to take the initial step towards their marriage. She clasped his arm, and they went along silently together, as true comrades oft-times do. He saw that she was preoccupied, and forbore to question her.</p>
<p>"Oh Jude&#8212;I've been talking to her," she said at last. "I wish I hadn't! And yet it is best to be reminded of things."</p>
<p>"I hope she was civil."</p>
<p>"Yes. I&#8212;I can't help liking her&#8212;just a little bit! She's not an ungenerous nature; and I am so glad her difficulties have all suddenly ended." She explained how Arabella had been summoned back, and would be enabled to retrieve her position. "I was referring to our old question. What Arabella has been saying to me has made me feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal marriage is&#8212;a sort of trap to catch a man&#8212;I can't bear to think of it. I wish I hadn't promised to let you put up the banns this morning!"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't mind me. Any time will do for me. I thought you might like to get it over quickly, now."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I don't feel any more anxious now than I did before. Perhaps with any other man I might be a little anxious; but among the very few virtues possessed by your family and mine, dear, I think I may set staunchness. So I am not a bit frightened about losing you, now I really am yours and you really are mine. In fact, I am easier in my mind than I was, for my conscience is clear about Richard, who now has a right to his freedom. I felt we were deceiving him before."</p>
<p>"Sue, you seem when you are like this to be one of the women of some grand old civilization, whom I used to read about in my bygone, wasted, classical days, rather than a denizen of a mere Christian country. I almost expect you to say at these times that you have just been talking to some friend whom you met in the Via Sacra, about the latest news of Octavia or Livia; or have been listening to Aspasia's eloquence, or have been watching Praxiteles chiselling away at his latest Venus, while Phryne made complaint that she was tired of posing."</p>
<p>They had now reached the house of the parish clerk. Sue stood back, while her lover went up to the door. His hand was raised to knock when she said: "Jude!"</p>
<p>He looked round.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, would you mind?"</p>
<p>He came back to her.</p>
<p>"Just let us think," she said timidly. "I had such a horrid dream one night! &#8230; And Arabella&#8212;"</p>
<p>"What did Arabella say to you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, she said that when people were tied up you could get the law of a man better if he beat you&#8212;and how when couples quarrelled&#8230; Jude, do you think that when you must have me with you by law, we shall be so happy as we are now? The men and women of our family are very generous when everything depends upon their goodwill, but they always kick against compulsion. Don't you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation? Don't you think it is destructive to a passion whose essence is its gratuitousness?"</p>
<p>"Upon my word, love, you are beginning to frighten me, too, with all this foreboding! Well, let's go back and think it over."</p>
<p>Her face brightened. "Yes&#8212;so we will!" said she. And they turned from the clerk's door, Sue taking his arm and murmuring as they walked on homeward:<br/>
&#160;</p>
<blockquote><div>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="noindent">Can you keep the bee from ranging,<br/>
Or the ring-dove's neck from changing?<br/>
No! Nor fetter'd love&#8230;<br/>
&#160;</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>They thought it over, or postponed thinking. Certainly they postponed action, and seemed to live on in a dreamy paradise. At the end of a fortnight or three weeks matters remained unadvanced, and no banns were announced to the ears of any Aldbrickham congregation.</p>
<p>Whilst they were postponing and postponing thus a letter and a newspaper arrived before breakfast one morning from Arabella. Seeing the handwriting Jude went up to Sue's room and told her, and as soon as she was dressed she hastened down. Sue opened the newspaper; Jude the letter. After glancing at the paper she held across the first page to him with her finger on a paragraph; but he was so absorbed in his letter that he did not turn awhile.</p>
<p>"Look!" said she.</p>
<p>He looked and read. The paper was one that circulated in South London only, and the marked advertisement was simply the announcement of a marriage at St. John's Church, Waterloo Road, under the names, "<span class="smallcaps">Cartlett&#8212;&#8212;Donn</span>"; the united pair being Arabella and the inn-keeper.</p>
<p>"Well, it is satisfactory," said Sue complacently. "Though, after this, it seems rather low to do likewise, and I am glad. However, she is provided for now in a way, I suppose, whatever her faults, poor thing. It is nicer that we are able to think that, than to be uneasy about her. I ought, too, to write to Richard and ask him how he is getting on, perhaps?"</p>
<p>But Jude's attention was still absorbed. Having merely glanced at the announcement he said in a disturbed voice: "Listen to this letter. What shall I say or do?"<br/>
&#160;</p>
<blockquote><div>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="jright"><span class="smallcaps">The Three Horns, Lambeth</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Dear Jude</span> (I won't be so distant as to call you Mr. Fawley),&#8212;I send to-day a newspaper, from which useful document you will learn that I was married over again to Cartlett last Tuesday. So that business is settled right and tight at last. But what I write about more particular is that private affair I wanted to speak to you on when I came down to Aldbrickham. I couldn't very well tell it to your lady friend, and should much have liked to let you know it by word of mouth, as I could have explained better than by letter. The fact is, Jude, that, though I have never informed you before, there was a boy born of our marriage, eight months after I left you, when I was at Sydney, living with my father and mother. All that is easily provable. As I had separated from you before I thought such a thing was going to happen, and I was over there, and our quarrel had been sharp, I did not think it convenient to write about the birth. I was then looking out for a good situation, so my parents took the child, and he has been with them ever since. That was why I did not mention it when I met you in Christminster, nor at the law proceedings. He is now of an intelligent age, of course, and my mother and father have lately written to say that, as they have rather a hard struggle over there, and I am settled comfortably here, they don't see why they should be encumbered with the child any longer, his parents being alive. I would have him with me here in a moment, but he is not old enough to be of any use in the bar nor will be for years and years, and naturally Cartlett might think him in the way. They have, however, packed him off to me in charge of some friends who happened to be coming home, and I must ask you to take him when he arrives, for I don't know what to do with him. He is lawfully yours, that I solemnly swear. If anybody says he isn't, call them brimstone liars, for my sake. Whatever I may have done before or afterwards, I was honest to you from the time we were married till I went away, and I remain, yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="ind10"><span class="smallcaps">Arabella Cartlett</span>.</span><br/>
&#160;</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Sue's look was one of dismay. "What will you do, dear?" she asked faintly.</p>
<p>Jude did not reply, and Sue watched him anxiously, with heavy breaths.</p>
<p>"It hits me hard!" said he in an under-voice. "It <i>may</i> be true! I can't make it out. Certainly, if his birth was exactly when she says, he's mine. I cannot think why she didn't tell me when I met her at Christminster, and came on here that evening with her! &#8230; Ah&#8212;I do remember now that she said something about having a thing on her mind that she would like me to know, if ever we lived together again."</p>
<p>"The poor child seems to be wanted by nobody!" Sue replied, and her eyes filled.</p>
<p>Jude had by this time come to himself. "What a view of life he must have, mine or not mine!" he said. "I must say that, if I were better off, I should not stop for a moment to think whose he might be. I would take him and bring him up. The beggarly question of parentage&#8212;what is it, after all? What does it matter, when you come to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not? All the little ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of the time, and entitled to our general care. That excessive regard of parents for their own children, and their dislike of other people's, is, like class-feeling, patriotism, save-your-own-soul-ism, and other virtues, a mean exclusiveness at bottom."</p>
<p>Sue jumped up and kissed Jude with passionate devotion. "Yes&#8212;so it is, dearest! And we'll have him here! And if he isn't yours it makes it all the better. I do hope he isn't&#8212;though perhaps I ought not to feel quite that! If he isn't, I should like so much for us to have him as an adopted child!"</p>
<p>"Well, you must assume about him what is most pleasing to you, my curious little comrade!" he said. "I feel that, anyhow, I don't like to leave the unfortunate little fellow to neglect. Just think of his life in a Lambeth pothouse, and all its evil influences, with a parent who doesn't want him, and has, indeed, hardly seen him, and a stepfather who doesn't know him. 'Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived!' That's what the boy&#8212;<i>my</i> boy, perhaps, will find himself saying before long!"</p>
<p>"Oh no!"</p>
<p>"As I was the petitioner, I am really entitled to his custody, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Whether or no, we must have him. I see that. I'll do the best I can to be a mother to him, and we can afford to keep him somehow. I'll work harder. I wonder when he'll arrive?"</p>
<p>"In the course of a few weeks, I suppose."</p>
<p>"I wish&#8212;When shall we have courage to marry, Jude?"</p>
<p>"Whenever you have it, I think I shall. It remains with you entirely, dear. Only say the word, and it's done."</p>
<p>"Before the boy comes?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"It would make a more natural home for him, perhaps," she murmured.</p>
<p>Jude thereupon wrote in purely formal terms to request that the boy should be sent on to them as soon as he arrived, making no remark whatever on the surprising nature of Arabella's information, nor vouchsafing a single word of opinion on the boy's paternity, nor on whether, had he known all this, his conduct towards her would have been quite the same.</p>
<p>In the down-train that was timed to reach Aldbrickham station about ten o'clock the next evening, a small, pale child's face could be seen in the gloom of a third-class carriage. He had large, frightened eyes, and wore a white woollen cravat, over which a key was suspended round his neck by a piece of common string: the key attracting attention by its occasional shine in the lamplight. In the band of his hat his half-ticket was stuck. His eyes remained mostly fixed on the back of the seat opposite, and never turned to the window even when a station was reached and called. On the other seat were two or three passengers, one of them a working woman who held a basket on her lap, in which was a tabby kitten. The woman opened the cover now and then, whereupon the kitten would put out its head, and indulge in playful antics. At these the fellow-passengers laughed, except the solitary boy bearing the key and ticket, who, regarding the kitten with his saucer eyes, seemed mutely to say: "All laughing comes from misapprehension. Rightly looked at there is no laughable thing under the sun."</p>
<p>Occasionally at a stoppage the guard would look into the compartment and say to the boy, "All right, my man. Your box is safe in the van." The boy would say, "Yes," without animation, would try to smile, and fail.</p>
<p>He was Age masquerading as Juvenility, and doing it so badly that his real self showed through crevices. A ground-swell from ancient years of night seemed now and then to lift the child in this his morning-life, when his face took a back view over some great Atlantic of Time, and appeared not to care about what it saw.</p>
<p>When the other travellers closed their eyes, which they did one by one&#8212;even the kitten curling itself up in the basket, weary of its too circumscribed play&#8212;the boy remained just as before. He then seemed to be doubly awake, like an enslaved and dwarfed divinity, sitting passive and regarding his companions as if he saw their whole rounded lives rather than their immediate figures.</p>
<p>This was Arabella's boy. With her usual carelessness she had postponed writing to Jude about him till the eve of his landing, when she could absolutely postpone no longer, though she had known for weeks of his approaching arrival, and had, as she truly said, visited Aldbrickham mainly to reveal the boy's existence and his near home-coming to Jude. This very day on which she had received her former husband's answer at some time in the afternoon, the child reached the London Docks, and the family in whose charge he had come, having put him into a cab for Lambeth and directed the cabman to his mother's house, bade him good-bye, and went their way.</p>
<p>On his arrival at the Three Horns, Arabella had looked him over with an expression that was as good as saying, "You are very much what I expected you to be," had given him a good meal, a little money, and, late as it was getting, dispatched him to Jude by the next train, wishing her husband Cartlett, who was out, not to see him.</p>
<p>The train reached Aldbrickham, and the boy was deposited on the lonely platform beside his box. The collector took his ticket and, with a meditative sense of the unfitness of things, asked him where he was going by himself at that time of night.</p>
<p>"Going to Spring Street," said the little one impassively.</p>
<p>"Why, that's a long way from here; a'most out in the country; and the folks will be gone to bed."</p>
<p>"I've got to go there."</p>
<p>"You must have a fly for your box."</p>
<p>"No. I must walk."</p>
<p>"Oh well: you'd better leave your box here and send for it. There's a 'bus goes half-way, but you'll have to walk the rest."</p>
<p>"I am not afraid."</p>
<p>"Why didn't your friends come to meet 'ee?"</p>
<p>"I suppose they didn't know I was coming."</p>
<p>"Who is your friends?"</p>
<p>"Mother didn't wish me to say."</p>
<p>"All I can do, then, is to take charge of this. Now walk as fast as you can."</p>
<p>Saying nothing further the boy came out into the street, looking round to see that nobody followed or observed him. When he had walked some little distance he asked for the street of his destination. He was told to go straight on quite into the outskirts of the place.</p>
<p>The child fell into a steady mechanical creep which had in it an impersonal quality&#8212;the movement of the wave, or of the breeze, or of the cloud. He followed his directions literally, without an inquiring gaze at anything. It could have been seen that the boy's ideas of life were different from those of the local boys. Children begin with detail, and learn up to the general; they begin with the contiguous, and gradually comprehend the universal. The boy seemed to have begun with the generals of life, and never to have concerned himself with the particulars. To him the houses, the willows, the obscure fields beyond, were apparently regarded not as brick residences, pollards, meadows; but as human dwellings in the abstract, vegetation, and the wide dark world.</p>
<p>He found the way to the little lane, and knocked at the door of Jude's house. Jude had just retired to bed, and Sue was about to enter her chamber adjoining when she heard the knock and came down.</p>
<p>"Is this where Father lives?" asked the child.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Fawley, that's his name."</p>
<p>Sue ran up to Jude's room and told him, and he hurried down as soon as he could, though to her impatience he seemed long.</p>
<p>"What&#8212;is it he&#8212;so soon?" she asked as Jude came.</p>
<p>She scrutinized the child's features, and suddenly went away into the little sitting-room adjoining. Jude lifted the boy to a level with himself, keenly regarded him with gloomy tenderness, and telling him he would have been met if they had known of his coming so soon, set him provisionally in a chair whilst he went to look for Sue, whose supersensitiveness was disturbed, as he knew. He found her in the dark, bending over an arm-chair. He enclosed her with his arm, and putting his face by hers, whispered, "What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"What Arabella says is true&#8212;true! I see you in him!"</p>
<p>"Well: that's one thing in my life as it should be, at any rate."</p>
<p>"But the other half of him is&#8212;<i>she</i>! And that's what I can't bear! But I ought to&#8212;I'll try to get used to it; yes, I ought!"</p>
<p>"Jealous little Sue! I withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness. Never mind! Time may right things&#8230; And Sue, darling; I have an idea! We'll educate and train him with a view to the university. What I couldn't accomplish in my own person perhaps I can carry out through him? They are making it easier for poor students now, you know."</p>
<p>"Oh you dreamer!" said she, and holding his hand returned to the child with him. The boy looked at her as she had looked at him. "Is it you who's my <i>real</i> mother at last?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Why? Do I look like your father's wife?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes; 'cept he seems fond of you, and you of him. Can I call you Mother?"</p>
<p>Then a yearning look came over the child and he began to cry. Sue thereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise, being a harp which the least wind of emotion from another's heart could make to vibrate as readily as a radical stir in her own.</p>
<p>"You may call me Mother, if you wish to, my poor dear!" she said, bending her cheek against his to hide her tears.</p>
<p>"What's this round your neck?" asked Jude with affected calmness.</p>
<p>"The key of my box that's at the station."</p>
<p>They bustled about and got him some supper, and made him up a temporary bed, where he soon fell asleep. Both went and looked at him as he lay.</p>
<p>"He called you Mother two or three times before he dropped off," murmured Jude. "Wasn't it odd that he should have wanted to!"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;it was significant," said Sue. "There's more for us to think about in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the sky&#8230; I suppose, dear, we must pluck up courage, and get that ceremony over? It is no use struggling against the current, and I feel myself getting intertwined with my kind. Oh Jude, you'll love me dearly, won't you, afterwards! I do want to be kind to this child, and to be a mother to him; and our adding the legal form to our marriage might make it easier for me."</p>
<p>&#160;<a id="id_5-4"></a><br/>
&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00051">IV</h2>
<p>Their next and second attempt thereat was more deliberately made, though it was begun on the morning following the singular child's arrival at their home.</p>
<p>Him they found to be in the habit of sitting silent, his quaint and weird face set, and his eyes resting on things they did not see in the substantial world.</p>
<p>"His face is like the tragic mask of Melpomene," said Sue. "What is your name, dear? Did you tell us?"</p>
<p>"Little Father Time is what they always called me. It is a nickname; because I look so aged, they say."</p>
<p>"And you talk so, too," said Sue tenderly. "It is strange, Jude, that these preternaturally old boys almost always come from new countries. But what were you christened?"</p>
<p>"I never was."</p>
<p>"Why was that?"</p>
<p>"Because, if I died in damnation, 'twould save the expense of a Christian funeral."</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;your name is not Jude, then?" said his father with some disappointment.</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. "Never heerd on it."</p>
<p>"Of course not," said Sue quickly; "since she was hating you all the time!"</p>
<p>"We'll have him christened," said Jude; and privately to Sue: "The day we are married." Yet the advent of the child disturbed him.</p>
<p>Their position lent them shyness, and having an impression that a marriage at a superintendent registrar's office was more private than an ecclesiastical one, they decided to avoid a church this time. Both Sue and Jude together went to the office of the district to give notice: they had become such companions that they could hardly do anything of importance except in each other's company.</p>
<p>Jude Fawley signed the form of notice, Sue looking over his shoulder and watching his hand as it traced the words. As she read the four-square undertaking, never before seen by her, into which her own and Jude's names were inserted, and by which that very volatile essence, their love for each other, was supposed to be made permanent, her face seemed to grow painfully apprehensive. "Names and Surnames of the Parties"&#8212;(they were to be parties now, not lovers, she thought). "Condition"&#8212;(a horrid idea)&#8212;"Rank or Occupation"&#8212;"Age"&#8212;"Dwelling at"&#8212;"Length of Residence"&#8212;"Church or Building in which the Marriage is to be solemnized"&#8212;"District and County in which the Parties respectively dwell."</p>
<p>"It spoils the sentiment, doesn't it!" she said on their way home. "It seems making a more sordid business of it even than signing the contract in a vestry. There is a little poetry in a church. But we'll try to get through with it, dearest, now."</p>
<p>"We will. 'For what man is he that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her? Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.' So said the Jewish law-giver."</p>
<p>"How you know the Scriptures, Jude! You really ought to have been a parson. I can only quote profane writers!"</p>
<p>During the interval before the issuing of the certificate Sue, in her housekeeping errands, sometimes walked past the office, and furtively glancing in saw affixed to the wall the notice of the purposed clinch to their union. She could not bear its aspect. Coming after her previous experience of matrimony, all the romance of their attachment seemed to be starved away by placing her present case in the same category. She was usually leading little Father Time by the hand, and fancied that people thought him hers, and regarded the intended ceremony as the patching up of an old error.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jude decided to link his present with his past in some slight degree by inviting to the wedding the only person remaining on earth who was associated with his early life at Marygreen&#8212;the aged widow Mrs. Edlin, who had been his great-aunt's friend and nurse in her last illness. He hardly expected that she would come; but she did, bringing singular presents, in the form of apples, jam, brass snuffers, an ancient pewter dish, a warming-pan, and an enormous bag of goose feathers towards a bed. She was allotted the spare room in Jude's house, whither she retired early, and where they could hear her through the ceiling below, honestly saying the Lord's Prayer in a loud voice, as the Rubric directed.</p>
<p>As, however, she could not sleep, and discovered that Sue and Jude were still sitting up&#8212;it being in fact only ten o'clock&#8212;she dressed herself again and came down, and they all sat by the fire till a late hour&#8212;Father Time included; though, as he never spoke, they were hardly conscious of him.</p>
<p>"Well, I bain't set against marrying as your great-aunt was," said the widow. "And I hope 'twill be a jocund wedding for ye in all respects this time. Nobody can hope it more, knowing what I do of your families, which is more, I suppose, than anybody else now living. For they have been unlucky that way, God knows."</p>
<p>Sue breathed uneasily.</p>
<p>"They was always good-hearted people, too&#8212;wouldn't kill a fly if they knowed it," continued the wedding guest. "But things happened to thwart 'em, and if everything wasn't vitty they were upset. No doubt that's how he that the tale is told of came to do what 'a did&#8212;if he <i>were</i> one of your family."</p>
<p>"What was that?" said Jude.</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;that tale, ye know; he that was gibbeted just on the brow of the hill by the Brown House&#8212;not far from the milestone between Marygreen and Alfredston, where the other road branches off. But Lord, 'twas in my grandfather's time; and it medn' have been one of your folk at all."</p>
<p>"I know where the gibbet is said to have stood, very well," murmured Jude. "But I never heard of this. What&#8212;did this man&#8212;my ancestor and Sue's&#8212;kill his wife?"</p>
<p>"'Twer not that exactly. She ran away from him, with their child, to her friends; and while she was there the child died. He wanted the body, to bury it where his people lay, but she wouldn't give it up. Her husband then came in the night with a cart, and broke into the house to steal the coffin away; but he was catched, and being obstinate, wouldn't tell what he broke in for. They brought it in burglary, and that's why he was hanged and gibbeted on Brown House Hill. His wife went mad after he was dead. But it medn't be true that he belonged to ye more than to me."</p>
<p>A small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside, as if out of the earth: "If I was you, Mother, I wouldn't marry Father!" It came from little Time, and they started, for they had forgotten him.</p>
<p>"Oh, it is only a tale," said Sue cheeringly.</p>
<p>After this exhilarating tradition from the widow on the eve of the solemnization they rose, and, wishing their guest good-night, retired.</p>
<p>The next morning Sue, whose nervousness intensified with the hours, took Jude privately into the sitting-room before starting. "Jude, I want you to kiss me, as a lover, incorporeally," she said, tremulously nestling up to him, with damp lashes. "It won't be ever like this any more, will it! I wish we hadn't begun the business. But I suppose we must go on. How horrid that story was last night! It spoilt my thoughts of to-day. It makes me feel as if a tragic doom overhung our family, as it did the house of Atreus."</p>
<p>"Or the house of Jeroboam," said the quondam theologian.</p>
<p>"Yes. And it seems awful temerity in us two to go marrying! I am going to vow to you in the same words I vowed in to my other husband, and you to me in the same as you used to your other wife; regardless of the deterrent lesson we were taught by those experiments!"</p>
<p>"If you are uneasy I am made unhappy," said he. "I had hoped you would feel quite joyful. But if you don't, you don't. It is no use pretending. It is a dismal business to you, and that makes it so to me!"</p>
<p>"It is unpleasantly like that other morning&#8212;that's all," she murmured. "Let us go on now."</p>
<p>They started arm in arm for the office aforesaid, no witness accompanying them except the Widow Edlin. The day was chilly and dull, and a clammy fog blew through the town from "Royal-tower'd Thame." On the steps of the office there were the muddy foot-marks of people who had entered, and in the entry were damp umbrellas Within the office several persons were gathered, and our couple perceived that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was just in progress. Sue, Jude, and the widow stood in the background while this was going on, Sue reading the notices of marriage on the wall. The room was a dreary place to two of their temperament, though to its usual frequenters it doubtless seemed ordinary enough. Law-books in musty calf covered one wall, and elsewhere were post-office directories, and other books of reference. Papers in packets tied with red tape were pigeon-holed around, and some iron safes filled a recess, while the bare wood floor was, like the door-step, stained by previous visitors.</p>
<p>The soldier was sullen and reluctant: the bride sad and timid; she was soon, obviously, to become a mother, and she had a black eye. Their little business was soon done, and the twain and their friends straggled out, one of the witnesses saying casually to Jude and Sue in passing, as if he had known them before: "See the couple just come in? Ha, ha! That fellow is just out of gaol this morning. She met him at the gaol gates, and brought him straight here. She's paying for everything."</p>
<p>Sue turned her head and saw an ill-favoured man, closely cropped, with a broad-faced, pock-marked woman on his arm, ruddy with liquor and the satisfaction of being on the brink of a gratified desire. They jocosely saluted the outgoing couple, and went forward in front of Jude and Sue, whose diffidence was increasing. The latter drew back and turned to her lover, her mouth shaping itself like that of a child about to give way to grief:</p>
<p>"Jude&#8212;I don't like it here! I wish we hadn't come! The place gives me the horrors: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love! I wish it had been at church, if it had to be at all. It is not so vulgar there!"</p>
<p>"Dear little girl," said Jude. "How troubled and pale you look!"</p>
<p>"It must be performed here now, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"No&#8212;perhaps not necessarily."</p>
<p>He spoke to the clerk, and came back. "No&#8212;we need not marry here or anywhere, unless we like, even now," he said. "We can be married in a church, if not with the same certificate with another he'll give us, I think. Anyhow, let us go out till you are calmer, dear, and I too, and talk it over."</p>
<p>They went out stealthily and guiltily, as if they had committed a misdemeanour, closing the door without noise, and telling the widow, who had remained in the entry, to go home and await them; that they would call in any casual passers as witnesses, if necessary. When in the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they walked up and down as they had done long ago in the market-house at Melchester.</p>
<p>"Now, darling, what shall we do? We are making a mess of it, it strikes me. Still, <i>anything</i> that pleases you will please me."</p>
<p>"But Jude, dearest, I am worrying you! You wanted it to be there, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Well, to tell the truth, when I got inside I felt as if I didn't care much about it. The place depressed me almost as much as it did you&#8212;it was ugly. And then I thought of what you had said this morning as to whether we ought."</p>
<p>They walked on vaguely, till she paused, and her little voice began anew: "It seems so weak, too, to vacillate like this! And yet how much better than to act rashly a second time&#8230; How terrible that scene was to me! The expression in that flabby woman's face, leading her on to give herself to that gaol-bird, not for a few hours, as she would, but for a lifetime, as she must. And the other poor soul&#8212;to escape a nominal shame which was owing to the weakness of her character, degrading herself to the real shame of bondage to a tyrant who scorned her&#8212;a man whom to avoid for ever was her only chance of salvation&#8230; This is our parish church, isn't it? This is where it would have to be, if we did it in the usual way? A service or something seems to be going on."</p>
<p>Jude went up and looked in at the door. "Why&#8212;it is a wedding here too," he said. "Everybody seems to be on our tack to-day."</p>
<p>Sue said she supposed it was because Lent was just over, when there was always a crowd of marriages. "Let us listen," she said, "and find how it feels to us when performed in a church."</p>
<p>They stepped in, and entered a back seat, and watched the proceedings at the altar. The contracting couple appeared to belong to the well-to-do middle class, and the wedding altogether was of ordinary prettiness and interest. They could see the flowers tremble in the bride's hand, even at that distance, and could hear her mechanical murmur of words whose meaning her brain seemed to gather not at all under the pressure of her self-consciousness. Sue and Jude listened, and severally saw themselves in time past going through the same form of self-committal.</p>
<p>"It is not the same to her, poor thing, as it would be to me doing it over again with my present knowledge," Sue whispered. "You see, they are fresh to it, and take the proceedings as a matter of course. But having been awakened to its awful solemnity as we have, or at least as I have, by experience, and to my own too squeamish feelings perhaps sometimes, it really does seem immoral in me to go and undertake the same thing again with open eyes. Coming in here and seeing this has frightened me from a church wedding as much as the other did from a registry one&#8230; We are a weak, tremulous pair, Jude, and what others may feel confident in I feel doubts of&#8212;my being proof against the sordid conditions of a business contract again!"</p>
<p>Then they tried to laugh, and went on debating in whispers the object-lesson before them. And Jude said he also thought they were both too thin-skinned&#8212;that they ought never to have been born&#8212;much less have come together for the most preposterous of all joint ventures for <i>them</i>&#8212;matrimony.</p>
<p>His betrothed shuddered; and asked him earnestly if he indeed felt that they ought not to go in cold blood and sign that life-undertaking again? "It is awful if you think we have found ourselves not strong enough for it, and knowing this, are proposing to perjure ourselves," she said.</p>
<p>"I fancy I do think it&#8212;since you ask me," said Jude. "Remember I'll do it if you wish, own darling." While she hesitated he went on to confess that, though he thought they ought to be able to do it, he felt checked by the dread of incompetency just as she did&#8212;from their peculiarities, perhaps, because they were unlike other people. "We are horribly sensitive; that's really what's the matter with us, Sue!" he declared.</p>
<p>"I fancy more are like us than we think!"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know. The intention of the contract is good, and right for many, no doubt; but in our case it may defeat its own ends because we are the queer sort of people we are&#8212;folk in whom domestic ties of a forced kind snuff out cordiality and spontaneousness."</p>
<p>Sue still held that there was not much queer or exceptional in them: that all were so. "Everybody is getting to feel as we do. We are a little beforehand, that's all. In fifty, a hundred, years the descendants of these two will act and feel worse than we. They will see weltering humanity still more vividly than we do now, as<br/>
&#160;</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p class="noindent">Shapes like our own selves hideously multiplied,<br/>

</div></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and will be afraid to reproduce them."</p>
<p>"What a terrible line of poetry! &#8230; though I have felt it myself about my fellow-creatures, at morbid times."</p>
<p>Thus they murmured on, till Sue said more brightly:</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;the general question is not our business, and why should we plague ourselves about it? However different our reasons are we come to the same conclusion; that for us particular two, an irrevocable oath is risky. Then, Jude, let us go home without killing our dream! Yes? How good you are, my friend: you give way to all my whims!"</p>
<p>"They accord very much with my own."</p>
<p>He gave her a little kiss behind a pillar while the attention of everybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession entering the vestry; and then they came outside the building. By the door they waited till two or three carriages, which had gone away for a while, returned, and the new husband and wife came into the open daylight. Sue sighed.</p>
<p>"The flowers in the bride's hand are sadly like the garland which decked the heifers of sacrifice in old times!"</p>
<p>"Still, Sue, it is no worse for the woman than for the man. That's what some women fail to see, and instead of protesting against the conditions they protest against the man, the other victim; just as a woman in a crowd will abuse the man who crushes against her, when he is only the helpless transmitter of the pressure put upon him."</p>
<p>"Yes&#8212;some are like that, instead of uniting with the man against the common enemy, coercion." The bride and bridegroom had by this time driven off, and the two moved away with the rest of the idlers. "No&#8212;don't let's do it," she continued. "At least just now."</p>
<p>They reached home, and passing the window arm in arm saw the widow looking out at them. "Well," cried their guest when they entered, "I said to myself when I zeed ye coming so loving up to the door, 'They made up their minds at last, then!'"</p>
<p>They briefly hinted that they had not.</p>
<p>"What&#8212;and ha'n't ye really done it? Chok' it all, that I should have lived to see a good old saying like 'marry in haste and repent at leisure' spoiled like this by you two! 'Tis time I got back again to Marygreen&#8212;sakes if tidden&#8212;if this is what the new notions be leading us to! Nobody thought o' being afeard o' matrimony in my time, nor of much else but a cannon-ball or empty cupboard! Why when I and my poor man were married we thought no more o't than of a game o' dibs!"</p>
<p>"Don't tell the child when he comes in," whispered Sue nervously. "He'll think it has all gone on right, and it will be better that he should not be surprised and puzzled. Of course it is only put off for reconsideration. If we are happy as we are, what does it matter to anybody?"</p>
<p>&#160;<a id="id_5-5"></a><br/>
&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00052">V</h2>
<p>The purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him to express his personal views upon the grave controversy above given. That the twain were happy&#8212;between their times of sadness&#8212;was indubitable. And when the unexpected apparition of Jude's child in the house had shown itself to be no such disturbing event as it had looked, but one that brought into their lives a new and tender interest of an ennobling and unselfish kind, it rather helped than injured their happiness.</p>
<p>To be sure, with such pleasing anxious beings as they were, the boy's coming also brought with it much thought for the future, particularly as he seemed at present to be singularly deficient in all the usual hopes of childhood. But the pair tried to dismiss, for a while at least, a too strenuously forward view.</p>
<p>There is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls; the town may be called Stoke-Barehills. It stands with its gaunt, unattractive, ancient church, and its new red brick suburb, amid the open, chalk-soiled cornlands, near the middle of an imaginary triangle which has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham and Wintoncester, and the important military station of Quartershot. The great western highway from London passes through it, near a point where the road branches into two, merely to unite again some twenty miles further westward. Out of this bifurcation and reunion there used to arise among wheeled travellers, before railway days, endless questions of choice between the respective ways. But the question is now as dead as the scot-and-lot freeholder, the road waggoner, and the mail coachman who disputed it; and probably not a single inhabitant of Stoke-Barehills is now even aware that the two roads which part in his town ever meet again; for nobody now drives up and down the great western highway dally.</p>
<p>The most familiar object in Stoke-Barehills nowadays is its cemetery, standing among some picturesque medi&#230;val ruins beside the railway; the modern chapels, modern tombs, and modern shrubs having a look of intrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivy-covered decay of the ancient walls.</p>
<p>On a certain day, however, in the particular year which has now been reached by this narrative&#8212;the month being early June&#8212;the features of the town excite little interest, though many visitors arrive by the trains; some down-trains, in especial, nearly emptying themselves here. It is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show, whose vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like the tents of an investing army. Rows of marquees, huts, booths, pavilions, arcades, porticoes&#8212;every kind of structure short of a permanent one&#8212;cover the green field for the space of a square half-mile, and the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in a mass, and make straight for the exhibition ground. The way thereto is lined with shows, stalls, and hawkers on foot, who make a market-place of the whole roadway to the show proper, and lead some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before they reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see.</p>
<p>It is the popular day, the shilling day, and of the fast arriving excursion trains two from different directions enter the two contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute. One, like several which have preceded it, comes from London: the other by a cross-line from Aldbrickham; and from the London train alights a couple; a short, rather bloated man, with a globular stomach and small legs, resembling a top on two pegs, accompanied by a woman of rather fine figure and rather red face, dressed in black material, and covered with beads from bonnet to skirt, that made her glisten as if clad in chain-mail.</p>
<p>They cast their eyes around. The man was about to hire a fly as some others had done, when the woman said, "Don't be in such a hurry, Cartlett. It isn't so very far to the show-yard. Let us walk down the street into the place. Perhaps I can pick up a cheap bit of furniture or old china. It is years since I was here&#8212;never since I lived as a girl at Aldbrickham, and used to come across for a trip sometimes with my young man."</p>
<p>"You can't carry home furniture by excursion train," said, in a thick voice, her husband, the landlord of The Three Horns, Lambeth; for they had both come down from the tavern in that "excellent, densely populated, gin-drinking neighbourhood," which they had occupied ever since the advertisement in those words had attracted them thither. The configuration of the landlord showed that he, too, like his customers, was becoming affected by the liquors he retailed.</p>
<p>"Then I'll get it sent, if I see any worth having," said his wife.</p>
<p>They sauntered on, but had barely entered the town when her attention was attracted by a young couple leading a child, who had come out from the second platform, into which the train from Aldbrickham had steamed. They were walking just in front of the inn-keepers.</p>
<p>"Sakes alive!" said Arabella.</p>
<p>"What's that?" said Cartlett.</p>
<p>"Who do you think that couple is? Don't you recognize the man?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Not from the photos I have showed you?"</p>
<p>"Is it Fawley?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#8212;of course."</p>
<p>"Oh, well. I suppose he was inclined for a little sight-seeing like the rest of us." Cartlett's interest in Jude whatever it might have been when Arabella was new to him, had plainly flagged since her charms and her idiosyncrasies, her supernumerary hair-coils, and her optional dimples, were becoming as a tale that is told.</p>
<p>Arabella so regulated her pace and her husband's as to keep just in the rear of the other three, which it was easy to do without notice in such a stream of pedestrians. Her answers to Cartlett's remarks were vague and slight, for the group in front interested her more than all the rest of the spectacle.</p>
<p>"They are rather fond of one another and of their child, seemingly," continued the publican.</p>
<p>"<i>Their</i> child! 'Tisn't their child," said Arabella with a curious, sudden covetousness. "They haven't been married long enough for it to be theirs!"</p>
<p>But although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough in her to lead her to quash her husband's conjecture, she was not disposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary. Mr. Cartlett had no other idea than that his wife's child by her first husband was with his grandparents at the Antipodes.</p>
<p>"Oh I suppose not. She looks quite a girl."</p>
<p>"They are only lovers, or lately married, and have the child in charge, as anybody can see."</p>
<p>All continued to move ahead. The unwitting Sue and Jude, the couple in question, had determined to make this agricultural exhibition within twenty miles of their own town the occasion of a day's excursion which should combine exercise and amusement with instruction, at small expense. Not regardful of themselves alone, they had taken care to bring Father Time, to try every means of making him kindle and laugh like other boys, though he was to some extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse in their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed. But they soon ceased to consider him an observer, and went along with that tender attention to each other which the shyest can scarcely disguise, and which these, among entire strangers as they imagined, took less trouble to disguise than they might have done at home. Sue, in her new summer clothes, flexible and light as a bird, her little thumb stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade, went along as if she hardly touched ground, and as if a moderately strong puff of wind would float her over the hedge into the next field. Jude, in his light grey holiday-suit, was really proud of her companionship, not more for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words and ways. That complete mutual understanding, in which every glance and movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence between them, made them almost the two parts of a single whole.</p>
<p>The pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles, Arabella and her husband not far behind them. When inside the enclosure the publican's wife could see that the two ahead began to take trouble with the youngster, pointing out and explaining the many objects of interest, alive and dead; and a passing sadness would touch their faces at their every failure to disturb his indifference.</p>
<p>"How she sticks to him!" said Arabella. "Oh no&#8212;I fancy they are not married, or they wouldn't be so much to one another as that&#8230; I wonder!"</p>
<p>"But I thought you said he did marry her?"</p>
<p>"I heard he was going to&#8212;that's all, going to make another attempt, after putting it off once or twice&#8230; As far as they themselves are concerned they are the only two in the show. I should be ashamed of making myself so silly if I were he!"</p>
<p>"I don't see as how there's anything remarkable in their behaviour. I should never have noticed their being in love, if you hadn't said so."</p>
<p>"You never see anything," she rejoined. Nevertheless Cartlett's view of the lovers' or married pair's conduct was undoubtedly that of the general crowd, whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by what Arabella's sharpened vision discerned.</p>
<p>"He's charmed by her as if she were some fairy!" continued Arabella. "See how he looks round at her, and lets his eyes rest on her. I am inclined to think that she don't care for him quite so much as he does for her. She's not a particular warm-hearted creature to my thinking, though she cares for him pretty middling much&#8212;as much as she's able to; and he could make her heart ache a bit if he liked to try&#8212;which he's too simple to do. There&#8212;now they are going across to the cart-horse sheds. Come along."</p>
<p>"I don't want to see the cart-horses. It is no business of ours to follow these two. If we have come to see the show let us see it in our own way, as they do in theirs."</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;suppose we agree to meet somewhere in an hour's time&#8212;say at that refreshment tent over there, and go about independent? Then you can look at what you choose to, and so can I."</p>
<p>Cartlett was not loath to agree to this, and they parted&#8212;he proceeding to the shed where malting processes were being exhibited, and Arabella in the direction taken by Jude and Sue. Before, however, she had regained their wake a laughing face met her own, and she was confronted by Anny, the friend of her girlhood.</p>
<p>Anny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance encounter. "I am still living down there," she said, as soon as she was composed. "I am soon going to be married, but my intended couldn't come up here to-day. But there's lots of us come by excursion, though I've lost the rest of 'em for the present."</p>
<p>"Have you met Jude and his young woman, or wife, or whatever she is? I saw 'em by now."</p>
<p>"No. Not a glimpse of un for years!"</p>
<p>"Well, they are close by here somewhere. Yes&#8212;there they are&#8212;by that grey horse!"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's his present young woman&#8212;wife did you say? Has he married again?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"She's pretty, isn't she!"</p>
<p>"Yes&#8212;nothing to complain of; or jump at. Not much to depend on, though; a slim, fidgety little thing like that."</p>
<p>"He's a nice-looking chap, too! You ought to ha' stuck to un, Arabella."</p>
<p>"I don't know but I ought," murmured she.</p>
<p>Anny laughed. "That's you, Arabella! Always wanting another man than your own."</p>
<p>"Well, and what woman don't I should like to know? As for that body with him&#8212;she don't know what love is&#8212;at least what I call love! I can see in her face she don't."</p>
<p>"And perhaps, Abby dear, you don't know what she calls love."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't wish to! &#8230; Ah&#8212;they are making for the art department. I should like to see some pictures myself. Suppose we go that way?&#8212; Why, if all Wessex isn't here, I verily believe! There's Dr. Vilbert. Haven't seen him for years, and he's not looking a day older than when I used to know him. How do you do, Physician? I was just saying that you don't look a day older than when you knew me as a girl."</p>
<p>"Simply the result of taking my own pills regular, ma'am. Only two and threepence a box&#8212;warranted efficacious by the Government stamp. Now let me advise you to purchase the same immunity from the ravages of time by following my example? Only two-and-three."</p>
<p>The physician had produced a box from his waistcoat pocket, and Arabella was induced to make the purchase.</p>
<p>"At the same time," continued he, when the pills were paid for, "you have the advantage of me, Mrs.&#8212; Surely not Mrs. Fawley, once Miss Donn, of the vicinity of Marygreen?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But Mrs. Cartlett now."</p>
<p>"Ah&#8212;you lost him, then? Promising young fellow! A pupil of mine, you know. I taught him the dead languages. And believe me, he soon knew nearly as much as I."</p>
<p>"I lost him; but not as you think," said Arabella dryly. "The lawyers untied us. There he is, look, alive and lusty; along with that young woman, entering the art exhibition."</p>
<p>"Ah&#8212;dear me! Fond of her, apparently."</p>
<p>"They <i>say</i> they are cousins."</p>
<p>"Cousinship is a great convenience to their feelings, I should say?"</p>
<p>"Yes. So her husband thought, no doubt, when he divorced her&#8230; Shall we look at the pictures, too?"</p>
<p>The trio followed across the green and entered. Jude and Sue, with the child, unaware of the interest they were exciting, had gone up to a model at one end of the building, which they regarded with considerable attention for a long while before they went on. Arabella and her friends came to it in due course, and the inscription it bore was: "Model of Cardinal College, Christminster; by J. Fawley and S. F. M. Bridehead."</p>
<p>"Admiring their own work," said Arabella. "How like Jude&#8212;always thinking of colleges and Christminster, instead of attending to his business!"</p>
<p>They glanced cursorily at the pictures, and proceeded to the band-stand. When they had stood a little while listening to the music of the military performers, Jude, Sue, and the child came up on the other side. Arabella did not care if they should recognize her; but they were too deeply absorbed in their own lives, as translated into emotion by the military band, to perceive her under her beaded veil. She walked round the outside of the listening throng, passing behind the lovers, whose movements had an unexpected fascination for her to-day. Scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she noticed that Jude's hand sought Sue's as they stood, the two standing close together so as to conceal, as they supposed, this tacit expression of their mutual responsiveness.</p>
<p>"Silly fools&#8212;like two children!" Arabella whispered to herself morosely, as she rejoined her companions, with whom she preserved a preoccupied silence.</p>
<p>Anny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to Vilbert on Arabella's hankering interest in her first husband.</p>
<p>"Now," said the physician to Arabella, apart; "do you want anything such as this, Mrs. Cartlett? It is not compounded out of my regular pharmacop&#339;ia, but I am sometimes asked for such a thing." He produced a small phial of clear liquid. "A love-philtre, such as was used by the ancients with great effect. I found it out by study of their writings, and have never known it to fail."</p>
<p>"What is it made of?" asked Arabella curiously.</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;a distillation of the juices of doves' hearts&#8212;otherwise pigeons'&#8212;is one of the ingredients. It took nearly a hundred hearts to produce that small bottle full."</p>
<p>"How do you get pigeons enough?"</p>
<p>"To tell a secret, I get a piece of rock-salt, of which pigeons are inordinately fond, and place it in a dovecot on my roof. In a few hours the birds come to it from all points of the compass&#8212;east, west, north, and south&#8212;and thus I secure as many as I require. You use the liquid by contriving that the desired man shall take about ten drops of it in his drink. But remember, all this is told you because I gather from your questions that you mean to be a purchaser. You must keep faith with me?"</p>
<p>"Very well&#8212;I don't mind a bottle&#8212;to give some friend or other to try it on her young man." She produced five shillings, the price asked, and slipped the phial in her capacious bosom. Saying presently that she was due at an appointment with her husband she sauntered away towards the refreshment bar, Jude, his companion, and the child having gone on to the horticultural tent, where Arabella caught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom.</p>
<p>She waited a few minutes observing them, and then proceeded to join her spouse with no very amiable sentiments. She found him seated on a stool by the bar, talking to one of the gaily dressed maids who had served him with spirits.</p>
<p>"I should think you had enough of this business at home!" Arabella remarked gloomily. "Surely you didn't come fifty miles from your own bar to stick in another? Come, take me round the show, as other men do their wives! Dammy, one would think you were a young bachelor, with nobody to look after but yourself!"</p>
<p>"But we agreed to meet here; and what could I do but wait?"</p>
<p>"Well, now we have met, come along," she returned, ready to quarrel with the sun for shining on her. And they left the tent together, this pot-bellied man and florid woman, in the antipathetic, recriminatory mood of the average husband and wife of Christendom.</p>
<p>In the meantime the more exceptional couple and the boy still lingered in the pavilion of flowers&#8212;an enchanted palace to their appreciative taste&#8212;Sue's usually pale cheeks reflecting the pink of the tinted roses at which she gazed; for the gay sights, the air, the music, and the excitement of a day's outing with Jude had quickened her blood and made her eyes sparkle with vivacity. She adored roses, and what Arabella had witnessed was Sue detaining Jude almost against his will while she learnt the names of this variety and that, and put her face within an inch of their blooms to smell them.</p>
<p>"I should like to push my face quite into them&#8212;the dears!" she had said. "But I suppose it is against the rules to touch them&#8212;isn't it, Jude?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you baby," said he: and then playfully gave her a little push, so that her nose went among the petals.</p>
<p>"The policeman will be down on us, and I shall say it was my husband's fault!"</p>
<p>Then she looked up at him, and smiled in a way that told so much to Arabella.</p>
<p>"Happy?" he murmured.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"Why? Because you have come to the great Wessex Agricultural Show&#8212;or because <i>we</i> have come?"</p>
<p>"You are always trying to make me confess to all sorts of absurdities. Because I am improving my mind, of course, by seeing all these steam-ploughs, and threshing-machines, and chaff-cutters, and cows, and pigs, and sheep."</p>
<p>Jude was quite content with a baffle from his ever evasive companion. But when he had forgotten that he had put the question, and because he no longer wished for an answer, she went on: "I feel that we have returned to Greek joyousness, and have blinded ourselves to sickness and sorrow, and have forgotten what twenty-five centuries have taught the race since their time, as one of your Christminster luminaries says&#8230; There is one immediate shadow, however&#8212;only one." And she looked at the aged child, whom, though they had taken him to everything likely to attract a young intelligence, they had utterly failed to interest.</p>
<p>He knew what they were saying and thinking. "I am very, very sorry, Father and Mother," he said. "But please don't mind!&#8212;I can't help it. I should like the flowers very very much, if I didn't keep on thinking they'd be all withered in a few days!"</p>

<p>The unnoticed lives that the pair had hitherto led began, from the day of the suspended wedding onwards, to be observed and discussed by other persons than Arabella. The society of Spring Street and the neighbourhood generally did not understand, and probably could not have been made to understand, Sue and Jude's private minds, emotions, positions, and fears. The curious facts of a child coming to them unexpectedly, who called Jude "Father," and Sue "Mother," and a hitch in a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a registrar's office, together with rumours of the undefended cases in the law-courts, bore only one translation to plain minds.</p>
<p>Little Time&#8212;for though he was formally turned into "Jude," the apt nickname stuck to him&#8212;would come home from school in the evening, and repeat inquiries and remarks that had been made to him by the other boys; and cause Sue, and Jude when he heard them, a great deal of pain and sadness.</p>
<p>The result was that shortly after the attempt at the registrar's the pair went off&#8212;to London it was believed&#8212;for several days, hiring somebody to look to the boy. When they came back they let it be understood indirectly, and with total indifference and weariness of mien, that they were legally married at last. Sue, who had previously been called Mrs. Bridehead now openly adopted the name of Mrs. Fawley. Her dull, cowed, and listless manner for days seemed to substantiate all this.</p>
<p>But the mistake (as it was called) of their going away so secretly to do the business, kept up much of the mystery of their lives; and they found that they made not such advances with their neighbours as they had expected to do thereby. A living mystery was not much less interesting than a dead scandal.</p>
<p>The baker's lad and the grocer's boy, who at first had used to lift their hats gallantly to Sue when they came to execute their errands, in these days no longer took the trouble to render her that homage, and the neighbouring artizans' wives looked straight along the pavement when they encountered her.</p>
<p>Nobody molested them, it is true; but an oppressive atmosphere began to encircle their souls, particularly after their excursion to the show, as if that visit had brought some evil influence to bear on them. And their temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from this atmosphere, and to be indisposed to lighten it by vigorous and open statements. Their apparent attempt at reparation had come too late to be effective.</p>
<p>The headstone and epitaph orders fell off: and two or three months later, when autumn came, Jude perceived that he would have to return to journey-work again, a course all the more unfortunate just now, in that he had not as yet cleared off the debt he had unavoidably incurred in the payment of the law-costs of the previous year.</p>
<p>One evening he sat down to share the common meal with Sue and the child as usual. "I am thinking," he said to her, "that I'll hold on here no longer. The life suits us, certainly; but if we could get away to a place where we are unknown, we should be lighter hearted, and have a better chance. And so I am afraid we must break it up here, however awkward for you, poor dear!"</p>
<p>Sue was always much affected at a picture of herself as an object of pity, and she saddened.</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;I am not sorry," said she presently. "I am much depressed by the way they look at me here. And you have been keeping on this house and furniture entirely for me and the boy! You don't want it yourself, and the expense is unnecessary. But whatever we do, wherever we go, you won't take him away from me, Jude dear? I could not let him go now! The cloud upon his young mind makes him so pathetic to me; I do hope to lift it some day! And he loves me so. You won't take him away from me?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I won't, dear little girl! We'll get nice lodgings, wherever we go. I shall be moving about probably&#8212;getting a job here and a job there."</p>
<p>"I shall do something too, of course, till&#8212;till&#8212; Well, now I can't be useful in the lettering it behoves me to turn my hand to something else."</p>
<p>"Don't hurry about getting employment," he said regretfully. "I don't want you to do that. I wish you wouldn't, Sue. The boy and yourself are enough for you to attend to."</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door, and Jude answered it. Sue could hear the conversation:</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Fawley at home? &#8230; Biles and Willis the building contractors sent me to know if you'll undertake the relettering of the ten commandments in a little church they've been restoring lately in the country near here."</p>
<p>Jude reflected, and said he could undertake it.</p>
<p>"It is not a very artistic job," continued the messenger. "The clergyman is a very old-fashioned chap, and he has refused to let anything more be done to the church than cleaning and repairing."</p>
<p>"Excellent old man!" said Sue to herself, who was sentimentally opposed to the horrors of over-restoration.</p>
<p>"The Ten Commandments are fixed to the east end," the messenger went on, "and they want doing up with the rest of the wall there, since he won't have them carted off as old materials belonging to the contractor in the usual way of the trade."</p>
<p>A bargain as to terms was struck, and Jude came indoors. "There, you see," he said cheerfully. "One more job yet, at any rate, and you can help in it&#8212;at least you can try. We shall have all the church to ourselves, as the rest of the work is finished."</p>
<p>Next day Jude went out to the church, which was only two miles off. He found that what the contractor's clerk had said was true. The tables of the Jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of Christian grace, as the chief ornament of the chancel end, in the fine dry style of the last century. And as their framework was constructed of ornamental plaster they could not be taken down for repair. A portion, crumbled by damp, required renewal; and when this had been done, and the whole cleansed, he began to renew the lettering. On the second morning Sue came to see what assistance she could render, and also because they liked to be together.</p>
<p>The silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence, and, standing on a safe low platform erected by Jude, which she was nevertheless timid at mounting, she began painting in the letters of the first Table while he set about mending a portion of the second. She was quite pleased at her powers; she had acquired them in the days she painted illumined texts for the church-fitting shop at Christminster. Nobody seemed likely to disturb them; and the pleasant twitter of birds, and rustle of October leafage, came in through an open window, and mingled with their talk.</p>
<p>They were not, however, to be left thus snug and peaceful for long. About half-past twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without. The old vicar and his churchwarden entered, and, coming up to see what was being done, seemed surprised to discover that a young woman was assisting. They passed on into an aisle, at which time the door again opened, and another figure entered&#8212;a small one, that of little Time, who was crying. Sue had told him where he might find her between school-hours, if he wished. She came down from her perch, and said, "What's the matter, my dear?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't stay to eat my dinner in school, because they said&#8212;" He described how some boys had taunted him about his nominal mother, and Sue, grieved, expressed her indignation to Jude aloft. The child went into the churchyard, and Sue returned to her work. Meanwhile the door had opened again, and there shuffled in with a businesslike air the white-aproned woman who cleaned the church. Sue recognized her as one who had friends in Spring Street, whom she visited. The church-cleaner looked at Sue, gaped, and lifted her hands; she had evidently recognized Jude's companion as the latter had recognized her. Next came two ladies, and after talking to the charwoman they also moved forward, and as Sue stood reaching upward, watched her hand tracing the letters, and critically regarded her person in relief against the white wall, till she grew so nervous that she trembled visibly.</p>
<p>They went back to where the others were standing, talking in undertones: and one said&#8212;Sue could not hear which&#8212;"She's his wife, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Some say Yes: some say No," was the reply from the charwoman.</p>
<p>"Not? Then she ought to be, or somebody's&#8212;that's very clear!"</p>
<p>"They've only been married a very few weeks, whether or no."</p>
<p>"A strange pair to be painting the Two Tables! I wonder Biles and Willis could think of such a thing as hiring those!"</p>
<p>The churchwarden supposed that Biles and Willis knew of nothing wrong, and then the other, who had been talking to the old woman, explained what she meant by calling them strange people.</p>
<p>The probable drift of the subdued conversation which followed was made plain by the churchwarden breaking into an anecdote, in a voice that everybody in the church could hear, though obviously suggested by the present situation:</p>
<p>"Well, now, it is a curious thing, but my grandfather told me a strange tale of a most immoral case that happened at the painting of the Commandments in a church out by Gaymead&#8212;which is quite within a walk of this one. In them days Commandments were mostly done in gilt letters on a black ground, and that's how they were out where I say, before the owld church was rebuilded. It must have been somewhere about a hundred years ago that them Commandments wanted doing up just as ours do here, and they had to get men from Aldbrickham to do 'em. Now they wished to get the job finished by a particular Sunday, so the men had to work late Saturday night, against their will, for overtime was not paid then as 'tis now. There was no true religion in the country at that date, neither among pa'sons, clerks, nor people, and to keep the men up to their work the vicar had to let 'em have plenty of drink during the afternoon. As evening drawed on they sent for some more themselves; rum, by all account. It got later and later, and they got more and more fuddled, till at last they went a-putting their rum-bottle and rummers upon the communion table, and drawed up a trestle or two, and sate round comfortable and poured out again right hearty bumpers. No sooner had they tossed off their glasses than, so the story goes they fell down senseless, one and all. How long they bode so they didn't know, but when they came to themselves there was a terrible thunder-storm a-raging, and they seemed to see in the gloom a dark figure with very thin legs and a curious voot, a-standing on the ladder, and finishing their work. When it got daylight they could see that the work was really finished, and couldn't at all mind finishing it themselves. They went home, and the next thing they heard was that a great scandal had been caused in the church that Sunday morning, for when the people came and service began, all saw that the Ten Commandments wez painted with the 'nots' left out. Decent people wouldn't attend service there for a long time, and the Bishop had to be sent for to reconsecrate the church. That's the tradition as I used to hear it as a child. You must take it for what it is wo'th, but this case to-day has reminded me o't, as I say."</p>
