<h2 id="dlepubid00011">VI</h2>
<p>At this memorable date of his life he was, one Saturday, returning from Alfredston to Marygreen about three o'clock in the afternoon. It was fine, warm, and soft summer weather, and he walked with his tools at his back, his little chisels clinking faintly against the larger ones in his basket. It being the end of the week he had left work early, and had come out of the town by a round-about route which he did not usually frequent, having promised to call at a flour-mill near Cresscombe to execute a commission for his aunt.</p>
<p>He was in an enthusiastic mood. He seemed to see his way to living comfortably in Christminster in the course of a year or two, and knocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of which he had dreamed so much. He might, of course, have gone there now, in some capacity or other, but he preferred to enter the city with a little more assurance as to means than he could be said to feel at present. A warm self-content suffused him when he considered what he had already done. Now and then as he went along he turned to face the peeps of country on either side of him. But he hardly saw them; the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been accustomed to do when less occupied; and the one matter which really engaged him was the mental estimate of his progress thus far.</p>
<p>"I have acquired quite an average student's power to read the common ancient classics, Latin in particular." This was true, Jude possessing a facility in that language which enabled him with great ease to himself to beguile his lonely walks by imaginary conversations therein.</p>
<p>"I have read two books of the <i>Iliad</i>, besides being pretty familiar with passages such as the speech of Ph&#339;nix in the ninth book, the fight of Hector and Ajax in the fourteenth, the appearance of Achilles unarmed and his heavenly armour in the eighteenth, and the funeral games in the twenty-third. I have also done some Hesiod, a little scrap of Thucydides, and a lot of the Greek Testament&#8230; I wish there was only one dialect all the same.</p>
<p>"I have done some mathematics, including the first six and the eleventh and twelfth books of Euclid; and algebra as far as simple equations.</p>
<p>"I know something of the Fathers, and something of Roman and English history.</p>
<p>"These things are only a beginning. But I shall not make much farther advance here, from the difficulty of getting books. Hence I must next concentrate all my energies on settling in Christminster. Once there I shall so advance, with the assistance I shall there get, that my present knowledge will appear to me but as childish ignorance. I must save money, and I will; and one of those colleges shall open its doors to me&#8212;shall welcome whom now it would spurn, if I wait twenty years for the welcome.</p>
<p>"I'll be D.D. before I have done!"</p>
<p>And then he continued to dream, and thought he might become even a bishop by leading a pure, energetic, wise, Christian life. And what an example he would set! If his income were &#163;5000 a year, he would give away &#163;4500 in one form and another, and live sumptuously (for him) on the remainder. Well, on second thoughts, a bishop was absurd. He would draw the line at an archdeacon. Perhaps a man could be as good and as learned and as useful in the capacity of archdeacon as in that of bishop. Yet he thought of the bishop again.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile I will read, as soon as I am settled in Christminster, the books I have not been able to get hold of here: Livy, Tacitus, Herodotus, &#198;schylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Hoity-toity!" The sounds were expressed in light voices on the other side of the hedge, but he did not notice them. His thoughts went on:</p>
<p>"&#8212;Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, Epictetus, Seneca, Antoninus. Then I must master other things: the Fathers thoroughly; Bede and ecclesiastical history generally; a smattering of Hebrew&#8212;I only know the letters as yet&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Hoity-toity!"</p>
<p>"&#8212;but I can work hard. I have staying power in abundance, thank God! and it is that which tells&#8230; Yes, Christminster shall be my Alma Mater; and I'll be her beloved son, in whom she shall be well pleased."</p>
<p>In his deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude's walk had slackened, and he was now standing quite still, looking at the ground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic lantern. On a sudden something smacked him sharply in the ear, and he became aware that a soft cold substance had been flung at him, and had fallen at his feet.</p>
<p>A glance told him what it was&#8212;a piece of flesh, the characteristic part of a barrow-pig, which the countrymen used for greasing their boots, as it was useless for any other purpose. Pigs were rather plentiful hereabout, being bred and fattened in large numbers in certain parts of North Wessex.</p>
<p>On the other side of the hedge was a stream, whence, as he now for the first time realized, had come the slight sounds of voices and laughter that had mingled with his dreams. He mounted the bank and looked over the fence. On the further side of the stream stood a small homestead, having a garden and pig-sties attached; in front of it, beside the brook, three young women were kneeling, with buckets and platters beside them containing heaps of pigs' chitterlings, which they were washing in the running water. One or two pairs of eyes slyly glanced up, and perceiving that his attention had at last been attracted, and that he was watching them, they braced themselves for inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and recommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" said Jude severely.</p>
<p>"I <i>didn't</i> throw it, I tell you!" asserted one girl to her neighbour, as if unconscious of the young man's presence.</p>
<p>"Nor I," the second answered.</p>
<p>"Oh, Anny, how can you!" said the third.</p>
<p>"If I had thrown anything at all, it shouldn't have been <i>that</i>!"</p>
<p>"Pooh! I don't care for him!" And they laughed and continued their work, without looking up, still ostentatiously accusing each other.</p>
<p>Jude grew sarcastic as he wiped his face, and caught their remarks.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> didn't do it&#8212;oh no!" he said to the up-stream one of the three.</p>
<p>She whom he addressed was a fine dark-eyed girl, not exactly handsome, but capable of passing as such at a little distance, despite some coarseness of skin and fibre. She had a round and prominent bosom, full lips, perfect teeth, and the rich complexion of a Cochin hen's egg. She was a complete and substantial female animal&#8212;no more, no less; and Jude was almost certain that to her was attributable the enterprise of attracting his attention from dreams of the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him.</p>
<p>"That you'll never be told," said she deedily.</p>
<p>"Whoever did it was wasteful of other people's property."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing."</p>
<p>"But you want to speak to me, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes; if you like to."</p>
<p>"Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?"</p>
<p>Perhaps she foresaw an opportunity; for somehow or other the eyes of the brown girl rested in his own when he had said the words, and there was a momentary flash of intelligence, a dumb announcement of affinity <i>in posse</i> between herself and him, which, so far as Jude Fawley was concerned, had no sort of premeditation in it. She saw that he had singled her out from the three, as a woman is singled out in such cases, for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance, but in commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters, unconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of their lives is to be occupied with the feminine.</p>
<p>Springing to her feet, she said: "Bring back what is lying there."</p>
<p>Jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her father's business had prompted her signal to him. He set down his basket of tools, picked up the scrap of offal, beat a pathway for himself with his stick, and got over the hedge. They walked in parallel lines, one on each bank of the stream, towards the small plank bridge. As the girl drew nearer to it, she gave without Jude perceiving it, an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her cheeks in succession, by which curious and original man&#339;uvre she brought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect dimple, which she was able to retain there as long as she continued to smile. This production of dimples at will was a not unknown operation, which many attempted, but only a few succeeded in accomplishing.</p>
<p>They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him.</p>
<p>But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till, moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him.</p>
<p>"You don't think <i>I</i> would shy things at you?"</p>
<p>"Oh no."</p>
<p>"We are doing this for my father, who naturally doesn't want anything thrown away. He makes that into dubbin." She nodded towards the fragment on the grass.</p>
<p>"What made either of the others throw it, I wonder?" Jude asked, politely accepting her assertion, though he had very large doubts as to its truth.</p>
<p>"Impudence. Don't tell folk it was I, mind!"</p>
<p>"How can I? I don't know your name."</p>
<p>"Ah, no. Shall I tell it to you?"</p>
<p>"Do!"</p>
<p>"Arabella Donn. I'm living here."</p>
<p>"I must have known it if I had often come this way. But I mostly go straight along the high-road."</p>
<p>"My father is a pig-breeder, and these girls are helping me wash the innerds for black-puddings and such like."</p>
<p>They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the hand-rail of the bridge. The unvoiced call of woman to man, which was uttered very distinctly by Arabella's personality, held Jude to the spot against his intention&#8212;almost against his will, and in a way new to his experience. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this moment Jude had never looked at a woman to consider her as such, but had vaguely regarded the sex as beings outside his life and purposes. He gazed from her eyes to her mouth, thence to her bosom, and to her full round naked arms, wet, mottled with the chill of the water, and firm as marble.</p>
<p>"What a nice-looking girl you are!" he murmured, though the words had not been necessary to express his sense of her magnetism.</p>
<p>"Ah, you should see me Sundays!" she said piquantly.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose I could?" he answered</p>
<p>"That's for you to think on. There's nobody after me just now, though there med be in a week or two." She had spoken this without a smile, and the dimples disappeared.</p>
<p>Jude felt himself drifting strangely, but could not help it. "Will you let me?"</p>
<p>"I don't mind."</p>
<p>By this time she had managed to get back one dimple by turning her face aside for a moment and repeating the odd little sucking operation before mentioned, Jude being still unconscious of more than a general impression of her appearance. "Next Sunday?" he hazarded. "To-morrow, that is?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Shall I call?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>She brightened with a little glow of triumph, swept him almost tenderly with her eyes in turning, and retracing her steps down the brookside grass rejoined her companions.</p>
<p>Jude Fawley shouldered his tool-basket and resumed his lonely way, filled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze. He had just inhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere, which had evidently been hanging round him everywhere he went, for he knew not how long, but had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as by a sheet of glass. The intentions as to reading, working, and learning, which he had so precisely formulated only a few minutes earlier, were suffering a curious collapse into a corner, he knew not how.</p>
<p>"Well, it's only a bit of fun," he said to himself, faintly conscious that to common sense there was something lacking, and still more obviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had drawn him to her which made it necessary that he should assert mere sportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking her&#8212;something in her quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied with literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream. It had been no vestal who chose <i>that</i> missile for opening her attack on him. He saw this with his intellectual eye, just for a short; fleeting while, as by the light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an inscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness. And then this passing discriminative power was withdrawn, and Jude was lost to all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure, that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto unsuspected, though it had lain close beside him. He was to meet this enkindling one of the other sex on the following Sunday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the girl had joined her companions, and she silently resumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid stream.</p>
<p>"Catched un, my dear?" laconically asked the girl called Anny.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I wish I had thrown something else than that!" regretfully murmured Arabella.</p>
<p>"Lord! he's nobody, though you med think so. He used to drive old Drusilla Fawley's bread-cart out at Marygreen, till he 'prenticed himself at Alfredston. Since then he's been very stuck up, and always reading. He wants to be a scholar, they say."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't care what he is, or anything about 'n. Don't you think it, my child!"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't ye! You needn't try to deceive us! What did you stay talking to him for, if you didn't want un? Whether you do or whether you don't, he's as simple as a child. I could see it as you courted on the bridge, when he looked at 'ee as if he had never seen a woman before in his born days. Well, he's to be had by any woman who can get him to care for her a bit, if she likes to set herself to catch him the right way."</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00012">VII</h2>
<p>The next day Jude Fawley was pausing in his bedroom with the sloping ceiling, looking at the books on the table, and then at the black mark on the plaster above them, made by the smoke of his lamp in past months.</p>
<p>It was Sunday afternoon, four-and-twenty hours after his meeting with Arabella Donn. During the whole bygone week he had been resolving to set this afternoon apart for a special purpose,&#8212;the re-reading of his Greek Testament&#8212;his new one, with better type than his old copy, following Griesbach's text as amended by numerous correctors, and with variorum readings in the margin. He was proud of the book, having obtained it by boldly writing to its London publisher, a thing he had never done before.</p>
<p>He had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon's reading, under the quiet roof of his great-aunt's house as formerly, where he now slept only two nights a week. But a new thing, a great hitch, had happened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life, and he felt as a snake must feel who has sloughed off its winter skin, and cannot understand the brightness and sensitiveness of its new one.</p>
<p>He would not go out to meet her, after all. He sat down, opened the book, and with his elbows firmly planted on the table, and his hands to his temples, began at the beginning:<br/>
&#160;</p>
<blockquote><div>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="noindent"><b>&#919;&#160;&#922;&#913;&#921;&#925;&#919; &#916;&#921;&#913;&#920;&#919;&#922;&#919;.</b><br/>
&#160;</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Had he promised to call for her? Surely he had! She would wait indoors, poor girl, and waste all her afternoon on account of him. There was a something in her, too, which was very winning, apart from promises. He ought not to break faith with her. Even though he had only Sundays and week-day evenings for reading he could afford one afternoon, seeing that other young men afforded so many. After to-day he would never probably see her again. Indeed, it would be impossible, considering what his plans were.</p>
<p>In short, as if materially, a compelling arm of extraordinary muscular power seized hold of him&#8212;something which had nothing in common with the spirits and influences that had moved him hitherto. This seemed to care little for his reason and his will, nothing for his so-called elevated intentions, and moved him along, as a violent schoolmaster a schoolboy he has seized by the collar, in a direction which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no respect, and whose life had nothing in common with his own except locality.</p>
<p>&#919;&#160;&#922;&#913;&#921;&#925;&#919; &#916;&#921;&#913;&#920;&#919;&#922;&#919; was no more heeded, and the predestinate Jude sprang up and across the room. Foreseeing such an event he had already arrayed himself in his best clothes. In three minutes he was out of the house and descending by the path across the wide vacant hollow of corn-ground which lay between the village and the isolated house of Arabella in the dip beyond the upland.</p>
<p>As he walked he looked at his watch. He could be back in two hours, easily, and a good long time would still remain to him for reading after tea.</p>
<p>Passing the few unhealthy fir-trees and cottage where the path joined the highway he hastened along, and struck away to the left, descending the steep side of the country to the west of the Brown House. Here at the base of the chalk formation he neared the brook that oozed from it, and followed the stream till he reached her dwelling. A smell of piggeries came from the back, and the grunting of the originators of that smell. He entered the garden, and knocked at the door with the knob of his stick.</p>
<p>Somebody had seen him through the window, for a male voice on the inside said:</p>
<p>"Arabella! Here's your young man come coorting! Mizzle, my girl!"</p>
<p>Jude winced at the words. Courting in such a businesslike aspect as it evidently wore to the speaker was the last thing he was thinking of. He was going to walk with her, perhaps kiss her; but "courting" was too coolly purposeful to be anything but repugnant to his ideas. The door was opened and he entered, just as Arabella came downstairs in radiant walking attire.</p>
<p>"Take a chair, Mr. What's-your-name?" said her father, an energetic, black-whiskered man, in the same businesslike tones Jude had heard from outside.</p>
<p>"I'd rather go out at once, wouldn't you?" she whispered to Jude.</p>
<p>"Yes," said he. "We'll walk up to the Brown House and back, we can do it in half an hour."</p>
<p>Arabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings that he felt glad he had come, and all the misgivings vanished that had hitherto haunted him.</p>
<p>First they clambered to the top of the great down, during which ascent he had occasionally to take her hand to assist her. Then they bore off to the left along the crest into the ridgeway, which they followed till it intersected the high-road at the Brown House aforesaid, the spot of his former fervid desires to behold Christminster. But he forgot them now. He talked the commonest local twaddle to Arabella with greater zest than he would have felt in discussing all the philosophies with all the Dons in the recently adored university, and passed the spot where he had knelt to Diana and Ph&#339;bus without remembering that there were any such people in the mythology, or that the sun was anything else than a useful lamp for illuminating Arabella's face. An indescribable lightness of heel served to lift him along; and Jude, the incipient scholar, prospective D.D., professor, bishop, or what not, felt himself honoured and glorified by the condescension of this handsome country wench in agreeing to take a walk with him in her Sunday frock and ribbons.</p>
<p>They reached the Brown House barn&#8212;the point at which he had planned to turn back. While looking over the vast northern landscape from this spot they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke from the neighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a distance of a couple of miles.</p>
<p>"It is a fire," said Arabella. "Let's run and see it&#8212;do! It is not far!"</p>
<p>The tenderness which had grown up in Jude's bosom left him no will to thwart her inclination now&#8212;which pleased him in affording him excuse for a longer time with her. They started off down the hill almost at a trot; but on gaining level ground at the bottom, and walking a mile, they found that the spot of the fire was much further off than it had seemed.</p>
<p>Having begun their journey, however, they pushed on; but it was not till five o'clock that they found themselves on the scene,&#8212;the distance being altogether about half-a-dozen miles from Marygreen, and three from Arabella's. The conflagration had been got under by the time they reached it, and after a short inspection of the melancholy ruins they retraced their steps&#8212;their course lying through the town of Alfredston.</p>
<p>Arabella said she would like some tea, and they entered an inn of an inferior class, and gave their order. As it was not for beer they had a long time to wait. The maid-servant recognized Jude, and whispered her surprise to her mistress in the background, that he, the student "who kept hisself up so particular," should have suddenly descended so low as to keep company with Arabella. The latter guessed what was being said, and laughed as she met the serious and tender gaze of her lover&#8212;the low and triumphant laugh of a careless woman who sees she is winning her game.</p>
<p>They sat and looked round the room, and at the picture of Samson and Delilah which hung on the wall, and at the circular beer-stains on the table, and at the spittoons underfoot filled with sawdust. The whole aspect of the scene had that depressing effect on Jude which few places can produce like a tap-room on a Sunday evening when the setting sun is slanting in, and no liquor is going, and the unfortunate wayfarer finds himself with no other haven of rest.</p>
<p>It began to grow dusk. They could not wait longer, really, for the tea, they said. "Yet what else can we do?" asked Jude. "It is a three-mile walk for you."</p>
<p>"I suppose we can have some beer," said Arabella.</p>
<p>"Beer, oh yes. I had forgotten that. Somehow it seems odd to come to a public-house for beer on a Sunday evening."</p>
<p>"But we didn't."</p>
<p>"No, we didn't." Jude by this time wished he was out of such an uncongenial atmosphere; but he ordered the beer, which was promptly brought.</p>
<p>Arabella tasted it. "Ugh!" she said.</p>
<p>Jude tasted. "What's the matter with it?" he asked. "I don't understand beer very much now, it is true. I like it well enough, but it is bad to read on, and I find coffee better. But this seems all right."</p>
<p>"Adulterated&#8212;I can't touch it!" She mentioned three or four ingredients that she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops, much to Jude's surprise.</p>
<p>"How much you know!" he said good-humouredly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she returned to the beer and drank her share, and they went on their way. It was now nearly dark, and as soon as they had withdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together, till they touched each other. She wondered why he did not put his arm round her waist, but he did not; he merely said what to himself seemed a quite bold enough thing: "Take my arm."</p>
<p>She took it, thoroughly, up to the shoulder. He felt the warmth of her body against his, and putting his stick under his other arm held with his right hand her right as it rested in its place.</p>
<p>"Now we are well together, dear, aren't we?" he observed.</p>
<p>"Yes," said she; adding to herself: "Rather mild!"</p>
<p>"How fast I have become!" he was thinking.</p>
<p>Thus they walked till they reached the foot of the upland, where they could see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom. From this point the only way of getting to Arabella's was by going up the incline, and dipping again into her valley on the right. Before they had climbed far they were nearly run into by two men who had been walking on the grass unseen.</p>
<p>"These lovers&#8212;you find 'em out o' doors in all seasons and weathers&#8212;lovers and homeless dogs only," said one of the men as they vanished down the hill.</p>
<p>Arabella tittered lightly.</p>
<p>"Are we lovers?" asked Jude.</p>
<p>"You know best."</p>
<p>"But you can tell me?"</p>
<p>For answer she inclined her head upon his shoulder. Jude took the hint, and encircling her waist with his arm, pulled her to him and kissed her.</p>
<p>They walked now no longer arm in arm but, as she had desired, clasped together. After all, what did it matter since it was dark, said Jude to himself. When they were half-way up the long hill they paused as by arrangement, and he kissed her again. They reached the top, and he kissed her once more.</p>
<p>"You can keep your arm there, if you would like to," she said gently.</p>
<p>He did so, thinking how trusting she was.</p>
<p>Thus they slowly went towards her home. He had left his cottage at half-past three, intending to be sitting down again to the New Testament by half-past five. It was nine o'clock when, with another embrace, he stood to deliver her up at her father's door.</p>
<p>She asked him to come in, if only for a minute, as it would seem so odd otherwise, and as if she had been out alone in the dark. He gave way, and followed her in. Immediately that the door was opened he found, in addition to her parents, several neighbours sitting round. They all spoke in a congratulatory manner, and took him seriously as Arabella's intended partner.</p>
<p>They did not belong to his set or circle, and he felt out of place and embarrassed. He had not meant this: a mere afternoon of pleasant walking with Arabella, that was all he had meant. He did not stay longer than to speak to her stepmother, a simple, quiet woman without features or character; and bidding them all good night plunged with a sense of relief into the track over the down.</p>
<p>But that sense was only temporary: Arabella soon re-asserted her sway in his soul. He walked as if he felt himself to be another man from the Jude of yesterday. What were his books to him? what were his intentions, hitherto adhered to so strictly, as to not wasting a single minute of time day by day? "Wasting!" It depended on your point of view to define that: he was just living for the first time: not wasting life. It was better to love a woman than to be a graduate, or a parson; ay, or a pope!</p>
<p>When he got back to the house his aunt had gone to bed, and a general consciousness of his neglect seemed written on the face of all things confronting him. He went upstairs without a light, and the dim interior of his room accosted him with sad inquiry. There lay his book open, just as he had left it, and the capital letters on the title-page regarded him with fixed reproach in the grey starlight, like the unclosed eyes of a dead man:<br/>

<p>Jude had to leave early next morning for his usual week of absence at lodgings; and it was with a sense of futility that he threw into his basket upon his tools and other necessaries the unread book he had brought with him.</p>
<p>He kept his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself. Arabella, on the contrary, made them public among all her friends and acquaintance.</p>
<p>Retracing by the light of dawn the road he had followed a few hours earlier under cover of darkness, with his sweetheart by his side, he reached the bottom of the hill, where he walked slowly, and stood still. He was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss. As the sun had only just risen it was possible that nobody had passed there since. Jude looked on the ground and sighed. He looked closely, and could just discern in the damp dust the imprints of their feet as they had stood locked in each other's arms. She was not there now, and "the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of nature" so depicted her past presence that a void was in his heart which nothing could fill. A pollard willow stood close to the place, and that willow was different from all other willows in the world. Utter annihilation of the six days which must elapse before he could see her again as he had promised would have been his intensest wish if he had had only the week to live.</p>
<p>An hour and a half later Arabella came along the same way with her two companions of the Saturday. She passed unheedingly the scene of the kiss, and the willow that marked it, though chattering freely on the subject to the other two.</p>
<p>"And what did he tell 'ee next?"</p>
<p>"Then he said&#8212;" And she related almost word for word some of his tenderest speeches. If Jude had been behind the fence he would have felt not a little surprised at learning how very few of his sayings and doings on the previous evening were private.</p>
<p>"You've got him to care for 'ee a bit, 'nation if you han't!" murmured Anny judicially. "It's well to be you!"</p>
<p>In a few moments Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of latent sensuousness: "I've got him to care for me: yes! But I want him to more than care for me; I want him to have me&#8212;to marry me! I must have him. I can't do without him. He's the sort of man I long for. I shall go mad if I can't give myself to him altogether! I felt I should when I first saw him!"</p>
<p>"As he is a romancing, straightfor'ard, honest chap, he's to be had, and as a husband, if you set about catching him in the right way."</p>
<p>Arabella remained thinking awhile. "What med be the right way?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Oh you don't know&#8212;you don't!" said Sarah, the third girl.</p>
<p>"On my word I don't!&#8212;No further, that is, than by plain courting, and taking care he don't go too far!"</p>
<p>The third girl looked at the second. "She <i>don't</i> know!"</p>
<p>"'Tis clear she don't!" said Anny.</p>
<p>"And having lived in a town, too, as one may say! Well, we can teach 'ee som'at then, as well as you us."</p>
<p>"Yes. And how do you mean&#8212;a sure way to gain a man? Take me for an innocent, and have done wi' it!"</p>
<p>"As a husband."</p>
<p>"As a husband."</p>
<p>"A countryman that's honourable and serious-minded such as he; God forbid that I should say a sojer, or sailor, or commercial gent from the towns, or any of them that be slippery with poor women! I'd do no friend that harm!"</p>
<p>"Well, such as he, of course!"</p>
<p>Arabella's companions looked at each other, and turning up their eyes in drollery began smirking. Then one went up close to Arabella, and, although nobody was near, imparted some information in a low tone, the other observing curiously the effect upon Arabella.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the last-named slowly. "I own I didn't think of that way! &#8230; But suppose he <i>isn't</i> honourable? A woman had better not have tried it!"</p>
<p>"Nothing venture nothing have! Besides, you make sure that he's honourable before you begin. You'd be safe enough with yours. I wish I had the chance! Lots of girls do it; or do you think they'd get married at all?"</p>
<p>Arabella pursued her way in silent thought. "I'll try it!" she whispered; but not to them.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00013">VIII</h2>
<p>One week's end Jude was as usual walking out to his aunt's at Marygreen from his lodging in Alfredston, a walk which now had large attractions for him quite other than his desire to see his aged and morose relative. He diverged to the right before ascending the hill with the single purpose of gaining, on his way, a glimpse of Arabella that should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments. Before quite reaching the homestead his alert eye perceived the top of her head moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge. Entering the gate he found that three young unfattened pigs had escaped from their sty by leaping clean over the top, and that she was endeavouring unassisted to drive them in through the door which she had set open. The lines of her countenance changed from the rigidity of business to the softness of love when she saw Jude, and she bent her eyes languishingly upon him. The animals took advantage of the pause by doubling and bolting out of the way.</p>
<p>"They were only put in this morning!" she cried, stimulated to pursue in spite of her lover's presence. "They were drove from Spaddleholt Farm only yesterday, where Father bought 'em at a stiff price enough. They are wanting to get home again, the stupid toads! Will you shut the garden gate, dear, and help me to get 'em in. There are no men folk at home, only Mother, and they'll be lost if we don't mind."</p>
<p>He set himself to assist, and dodged this way and that over the potato rows and the cabbages. Every now and then they ran together, when he caught her for a moment and kissed her. The first pig was got back promptly; the second with some difficulty; the third a long-legged creature, was more obstinate and agile. He plunged through a hole in the garden hedge, and into the lane.</p>
<p>"He'll be lost if I don't follow 'n!" said she. "Come along with me!"</p>
<p>She rushed in full pursuit out of the garden, Jude alongside her, barely contriving to keep the fugitive in sight. Occasionally they would shout to some boy to stop the animal, but he always wriggled past and ran on as before.</p>
<p>"Let me take your hand, darling," said Jude. "You are getting out of breath." She gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness, and they trotted along together.</p>
<p>"This comes of driving 'em home," she remarked. "They always know the way back if you do that. They ought to have been carted over."</p>
<p>By this time the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the open down, across which he sped with all the agility his little legs afforded. As soon as the pursuers had entered and ascended to the top of the high ground it became apparent that they would have to run all the way to the farmer's if they wished to get at him. From this summit he could be seen as a minute speck, following an unerring line towards his old home.</p>
<p>"It is no good!" cried Arabella. "He'll be there long before we get there. It don't matter now we know he's not lost or stolen on the way. They'll see it is ours, and send un back. Oh dear, how hot I be!"</p>
<p>Without relinquishing her hold of Jude's hand she swerved aside and flung herself down on the sod under a stunted thorn, precipitately pulling Jude on to his knees at the same time.</p>
<p>"Oh, I ask pardon&#8212;I nearly threw you down, didn't I! But I am so tired!"</p>
<p>She lay supine, and straight as an arrow, on the sloping sod of this hill-top, gazing up into the blue miles of sky, and still retaining her warm hold of Jude's hand. He reclined on his elbow near her.</p>
<p>"We've run all this way for nothing," she went on, her form heaving and falling in quick pants, her face flushed, her full red lips parted, and a fine dew of perspiration on her skin. "Well&#8212;why don't you speak, deary?"</p>
<p>"I'm blown too. It was all up hill."</p>
<p>They were in absolute solitude&#8212;the most apparent of all solitudes, that of empty surrounding space. Nobody could be nearer than a mile to them without their seeing him. They were, in fact, on one of the summits of the county, and the distant landscape around Christminster could be discerned from where they lay. But Jude did not think of that then.</p>
<p>"Oh, I can see such a pretty thing up this tree," said Arabella. "A sort of a&#8212;caterpillar, of the most loveliest green and yellow you ever came across!"</p>
<p>"Where?" said Jude, sitting up.</p>
<p>"You can't see him there&#8212;you must come here," said she.</p>
<p>He bent nearer and put his head in front of hers. "No&#8212;I can't see it," he said.</p>
<p>"Why, on the limb there where it branches off&#8212;close to the moving leaf&#8212;there!" She gently pulled him down beside her.</p>
<p>"I don't see it," he repeated, the back of his head against her cheek. "But I can, perhaps, standing up." He stood accordingly, placing himself in the direct line of her gaze.</p>
<p>"How stupid you are!" she said crossly, turning away her face.</p>
<p>"I don't care to see it, dear: why should I?" he replied looking down upon her. "Get up, Abby."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I want you to let me kiss you. I've been waiting to ever so long!"</p>
<p>She rolled round her face, remained a moment looking deedily aslant at him; then with a slight curl of the lip sprang to her feet, and exclaiming abruptly "I must mizzle!" walked off quickly homeward. Jude followed and rejoined her.</p>
<p>"Just one!" he coaxed.</p>
<p>"Shan't!" she said.</p>
<p>He, surprised: "What's the matter?"</p>
<p>She kept her two lips resentfully together, and Jude followed her like a pet lamb till she slackened her pace and walked beside him, talking calmly on indifferent subjects, and always checking him if he tried to take her hand or clasp her waist. Thus they descended to the precincts of her father's homestead, and Arabella went in, nodding good-bye to him with a supercilious, affronted air.</p>
<p>"I expect I took too much liberty with her, somehow," Jude said to himself, as he withdrew with a sigh and went on to Marygreen.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning the interior of Arabella's home was, as usual, the scene of a grand weekly cooking, the preparation of the special Sunday dinner. Her father was shaving before a little glass hung on the mullion of the window, and her mother and Arabella herself were shelling beans hard by. A neighbour passed on her way home from morning service at the nearest church, and seeing Donn engaged at the window with the razor, nodded and came in.</p>
<p>She at once spoke playfully to Arabella: "I zeed 'ee running with 'un&#8212;hee-hee! I hope 'tis coming to something?"</p>
<p>Arabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without raising her eyes.</p>
<p>"He's for Christminster, I hear, as soon as he can get there."</p>
<p>"Have you heard that lately&#8212;quite lately?" asked Arabella with a jealous, tigerish indrawing of breath.</p>
<p>"Oh no! But it has been known a long time that it is his plan. He's on'y waiting here for an opening. Ah well: he must walk about with somebody, I s'pose. Young men don't mean much now-a-days. 'Tis a sip here and a sip there with 'em. 'Twas different in my time."</p>
<p>When the gossip had departed Arabella said suddenly to her mother: "I want you and Father to go and inquire how the Edlins be, this evening after tea. Or no&#8212;there's evening service at Fensworth&#8212;you can walk to that."</p>
<p>"Oh? What's up to-night, then?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Only I want the house to myself. He's shy; and I can't get un to come in when you are here. I shall let him slip through my fingers if I don't mind, much as I care for 'n!"</p>
<p>"If it is fine we med as well go, since you wish."</p>
<p>In the afternoon Arabella met and walked with Jude, who had now for weeks ceased to look into a book of Greek, Latin, or any other tongue. They wandered up the slopes till they reached the green track along the ridge, which they followed to the circular British earth-bank adjoining, Jude thinking of the great age of the trackway, and of the drovers who had frequented it, probably before the Romans knew the country. Up from the level lands below them floated the chime of church bells. Presently they were reduced to one note, which quickened, and stopped.</p>
<p>"Now we'll go back," said Arabella, who had attended to the sounds.</p>
<p>Jude assented. So long as he was near her he minded little where he was. When they arrived at her house he said lingeringly: "I won't come in. Why are you in such a hurry to go in to-night? It is not near dark."</p>
<p>"Wait a moment," said she. She tried the handle of the door and found it locked.</p>
<p>"Ah&#8212;they are gone to church," she added. And searching behind the scraper she found the key and unlocked the door. "Now, you'll come in a moment?" she asked lightly. "We shall be all alone."</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Jude with alacrity, the case being unexpectedly altered.</p>
<p>Indoors they went. Did he want any tea? No, it was too late: he would rather sit and talk to her. She took off her jacket and hat, and they sat down&#8212;naturally enough close together.</p>
<p>"Don't touch me, please," she said softly. "I am part egg-shell. Or perhaps I had better put it in a safe place." She began unfastening the collar of her gown.</p>
<p>"What is it?" said her lover.</p>
<p>"An egg&#8212;a cochin's egg. I am hatching a very rare sort. I carry it about everywhere with me, and it will get hatched in less than three weeks."</p>
<p>"Where do you carry it?"</p>
<p>"Just here." She put her hand into her bosom and drew out the egg, which was wrapped in wool, outside it being a piece of pig's bladder, in case of accidents. Having exhibited it to him she put it back, "Now mind you don't come near me. I don't want to get it broke, and have to begin another."</p>
<p>"Why do you do such a strange thing?"</p>
<p>"It's an old custom. I suppose it is natural for a woman to want to bring live things into the world."</p>
<p>"It is very awkward for me just now," he said, laughing.</p>
<p>"It serves you right. There&#8212;that's all you can have of me"</p>
<p>She had turned round her chair, and, reaching over the back of it, presented her cheek to him gingerly.</p>
<p>"That's very shabby of you!"</p>
<p>"You should have catched me a minute ago when I had put the egg down! There!" she said defiantly, "I am without it now!" She had quickly withdrawn the egg a second time; but before he could quite reach her she had put it back as quickly, laughing with the excitement of her strategy. Then there was a little struggle, Jude making a plunge for it and capturing it triumphantly. Her face flushed; and becoming suddenly conscious he flushed also.</p>
<p>They looked at each other, panting; till he rose and said: "One kiss, now I can do it without damage to property; and I'll go!"</p>
<p>But she had jumped up too. "You must find me first!" she cried.</p>
<p>Her lover followed her as she withdrew. It was now dark inside the room, and the window being small he could not discover for a long time what had become of her, till a laugh revealed her to have rushed up the stairs, whither Jude rushed at her heels.</p>
<p>&#160;<a id="id_1-9"></a><br/>
&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00014">IX</h2>
<p>It was some two months later in the year, and the pair had met constantly during the interval. Arabella seemed dissatisfied; she was always imagining, and waiting, and wondering.</p>
<p>One day she met the itinerant Vilbert. She, like all the cottagers thereabout, knew the quack well, and she began telling him of her experiences. Arabella had been gloomy, but before he left her she had grown brighter. That evening she kept an appointment with Jude, who seemed sad.</p>
<p>"I am going away," he said to her. "I think I ought to go. I think it will be better both for you and for me. I wish some things had never begun! I was much to blame, I know. But it is never too late to mend."</p>
<p>Arabella began to cry. "How do you know it is not too late?" she said. "That's all very well to say! I haven't told you yet!" and she looked into his face with streaming eyes.</p>
<p>"What?" he asked, turning pale. "Not&#8230;?"</p>
<p>"Yes! And what shall I do if you desert me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Arabella&#8212;how can you say that, my dear! You <i>know</i> I wouldn't desert you!"</p>
<p>"Well then&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I have next to no wages as yet, you know; or perhaps I should have thought of this before&#8230; But, of course if that's the case, we must marry! What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?"</p>
<p>"I thought&#8212;I thought, deary, perhaps you would go away all the more for that, and leave me to face it alone!"</p>
<p>"You knew better! Of course I never dreamt six months ago, or even three, of marrying. It is a complete smashing up of my plans&#8212;I mean my plans before I knew you, my dear. But what are they, after all! Dreams about books, and degrees, and impossible fellowships, and all that. Certainly we'll marry: we must!"</p>
<p>That night he went out alone, and walked in the dark self-communing. He knew well, too well, in the secret centre of his brain, that Arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind. Yet, such being the custom of the rural districts among honourable young men who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman as he unfortunately had done, he was ready to abide by what he had said, and take the consequences. For his own soothing he kept up a factitious belief in her. His idea of her was the thing of most consequence, not Arabella herself, he sometimes said laconically.</p>
<p>The banns were put in and published the very next Sunday. The people of the parish all said what a simple fool young Fawley was. All his reading had only come to this, that he would have to sell his books to buy saucepans. Those who guessed the probable state of affairs, Arabella's parents being among them, declared that it was the sort of conduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as Jude in reparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart. The parson who married them seemed to think it satisfactory too. And so, standing before the aforesaid officiator, the two swore that at every other time of their lives till death took them, they would assuredly believe, feel, and desire precisely as they had believed, felt, and desired during the few preceding weeks. What was as remarkable as the undertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all surprised at what they swore.</p>
<p>Fawley's aunt being a baker she made him a bride-cake, saying bitterly that it was the last thing she could do for him, poor silly fellow; and that it would have been far better if, instead of his living to trouble her, he had gone underground years before with his father and mother. Of this cake Arabella took some slices, wrapped them up in white note-paper, and sent them to her companions in the pork-dressing business, Anny and Sarah, labelling each packet "<i>In remembrance of good advice</i>."</p>
<p>The prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very brilliant even to the most sanguine mind. He, a stone-mason's apprentice, nineteen years of age, was working for half wages till he should be out of his time. His wife was absolutely useless in a town-lodging, where he at first had considered it would be necessary for them to live. But the urgent need of adding to income in ever so little a degree caused him to take a lonely roadside cottage between the Brown House and Marygreen, that he might have the profits of a vegetable garden, and utilize her past experiences by letting her keep a pig. But it was not the sort of life he had bargained for, and it was a long way to walk to and from Alfredston every day. Arabella, however, felt that all these make-shifts were temporary; she had gained a husband; that was the thing&#8212;a husband with a lot of earning power in him for buying her frocks and hats when he should begin to get frightened a bit, and stick to his trade, and throw aside those stupid books for practical undertakings.</p>
<p>So to the cottage he took her on the evening of the marriage, giving up his old room at his aunt's&#8212;where so much of the hard labour at Greek and Latin had been carried on.</p>
<p>A little chill overspread him at her first unrobing. A long tail of hair, which Arabella wore twisted up in an enormous knob at the back of her head, was deliberately unfastened, stroked out, and hung upon the looking-glass which he had bought her.</p>
<p>"What&#8212;it wasn't your own?" he said, with a sudden distaste for her.</p>
<p>"Oh no&#8212;it never is nowadays with the better class."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Perhaps not in towns. But in the country it is supposed to be different. Besides, you've enough of your own, surely?"</p>
<p>"Yes, enough as country notions go. But in town the men expect more, and when I was barmaid at Aldbrickham&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Barmaid at Aldbrickham?"</p>
<p>"Well, not exactly barmaid&#8212;I used to draw the drink at a public-house there&#8212;just for a little time; that was all. Some people put me up to getting this, and I bought it just for a fancy. The more you have the better in Aldbrickham, which is a finer town than all your Christminsters. Every lady of position wears false hair&#8212;the barber's assistant told me so."</p>
<p>Jude thought with a feeling of sickness that though this might be true to some extent, for all that he knew, many unsophisticated girls would and did go to towns and remain there for years without losing their simplicity of life and embellishments. Others, alas, had an instinct towards artificiality in their very blood, and became adepts in counterfeiting at the first glimpse of it. However, perhaps there was no great sin in a woman adding to her hair, and he resolved to think no more of it.</p>
<p>A new-made wife can usually manage to excite interest for a few weeks, even though the prospects of the household ways and means are cloudy. There is a certain piquancy about her situation, and her manner to her acquaintance at the sense of it, which carries off the gloom of facts, and renders even the humblest bride independent awhile of the real. Mrs. Jude Fawley was walking in the streets of Alfredston one market-day with this quality in her carriage when she met Anny her former friend, whom she had not seen since the wedding.</p>
<p>As usual they laughed before talking; the world seemed funny to them without saying it.</p>
<p>"So it turned out a good plan, you see!" remarked the girl to the wife. "I knew it would with such as him. He's a dear good fellow, and you ought to be proud of un."</p>
<p>"I am," said Mrs. Fawley quietly.</p>
<p>"And when do you expect?"</p>
<p>"Ssh! Not at all."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"I was mistaken."</p>
<p>"Oh, Arabella, Arabella; you be a deep one! Mistaken! well, that's clever&#8212;it's a real stroke of genius! It is a thing I never thought o', wi' all my experience! I never thought beyond bringing about the real thing&#8212;not that one could sham it!"</p>
<p>"Don't you be too quick to cry sham! 'Twasn't sham. I didn't know."</p>
<p>"My word&#8212;won't he be in a taking! He'll give it to 'ee o' Saturday nights! Whatever it was, he'll say it was a trick&#8212;a double one, by the Lord!"</p>
<p>"I'll own to the first, but not to the second&#8230; Pooh&#8212;he won't care! He'll be glad I was wrong in what I said. He'll shake down, bless 'ee&#8212;men always do. What can 'em do otherwise? Married is married."</p>
<p>Nevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached the time when in the natural course of things she would have to reveal that the alarm she had raised had been without foundation. The occasion was one evening at bedtime, and they were in their chamber in the lonely cottage by the wayside to which Jude walked home from his work every day. He had worked hard the whole twelve hours, and had retired to rest before his wife. When she came into the room he was between sleeping and waking, and was barely conscious of her undressing before the little looking-glass as he lay.</p>
<p>One action of hers, however, brought him to full cognition. Her face being reflected towards him as she sat, he could perceive that she was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the dimple before alluded to, a curious accomplishment of which she was mistress, effecting it by a momentary suction. It seemed to him for the first time that the dimples were far oftener absent from her face during his intercourse with her nowadays than they had been in the earlier weeks of their acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Don't do that, Arabella!" he said suddenly. "There is no harm in it, but&#8212;I don't like to see you."</p>
<p>She turned and laughed. "Lord, I didn't know you were awake!" she said. "How countrified you are! That's nothing."</p>
<p>"Where did you learn it?"</p>
<p>"Nowhere that I know of. They used to stay without any trouble when I was at the public-house; but now they won't. My face was fatter then."</p>
<p>"I don't care about dimples. I don't think they improve a woman&#8212;particularly a married woman, and of full-sized figure like you."</p>
<p>"Most men think otherwise."</p>
<p>"I don't care what most men think, if they do. How do you know?"</p>
<p>"I used to be told so when I was serving in the tap-room."</p>
<p>"Ah&#8212;that public-house experience accounts for your knowing about the adulteration of the ale when we went and had some that Sunday evening. I thought when I married you that you had always lived in your father's house."</p>
<p>"You ought to have known better than that, and seen I was a little more finished than I could have been by staying where I was born. There was not much to do at home, and I was eating my head off, so I went away for three months."</p>
<p>"You'll soon have plenty to do now, dear, won't you?"</p>
<p>"How do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course&#8212;little things to make."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"When will it be? Can't you tell me exactly, instead of in such general terms as you have used?"</p>
<p>"Tell you?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#8212;the date."</p>
<p>"There's nothing to tell. I made a mistake."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"It was a mistake."</p>
<p>He sat bolt upright in bed and looked at her. "How can that be?"</p>
<p>"Women fancy wrong things sometimes."</p>
<p>"But&#8212;! Why, of course, so unprepared as I was, without a stick of furniture, and hardly a shilling, I shouldn't have hurried on our affair, and brought you to a half-furnished hut before I was ready, if it had not been for the news you gave me, which made it necessary to save you, ready or no&#8230; Good God!"</p>
<p>"Don't take on, dear. What's done can't be undone."</p>
<p>"I have no more to say!"</p>
<p>He gave the answer simply, and lay down; and there was silence between them.</p>
<p>When Jude awoke the next morning he seemed to see the world with a different eye. As to the point in question he was compelled to accept her word; in the circumstances he could not have acted otherwise while ordinary notions prevailed. But how came they to prevail?</p>
<p>There seemed to him, vaguely and dimly, something wrong in a social ritual which made necessary a cancelling of well-formed schemes involving years of thought and labour, of foregoing a man's one opportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals, and of contributing his units of work to the general progress of his generation, because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory instinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice, and could be only at the most called weakness. He was inclined to inquire what he had done, or she lost, for that matter, that he deserved to be caught in a gin which would cripple him, if not her also, for the rest of a lifetime? There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the immediate reason of his marriage had proved to be non-existent. But the marriage remained.</p>
<p>&#160;<a id="id_1-10"></a><br/>
&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00015">X</h2>
<p>The time arrived for killing the pig which Jude and his wife had fattened in their sty during the autumn months, and the butchering was timed to take place as soon as it was light in the morning, so that Jude might get to Alfredston without losing more than a quarter of a day.</p>
<p>The night had seemed strangely silent. Jude looked out of the window long before dawn, and perceived that the ground was covered with snow&#8212;snow rather deep for the season, it seemed, a few flakes still falling.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid the pig-killer won't be able to come," he said to Arabella.</p>
<p>"Oh, he'll come. You must get up and make the water hot, if you want Challow to scald him. Though I like singeing best."</p>
<p>"I'll get up," said Jude. "I like the way of my own county."</p>
<p>He went downstairs, lit the fire under the copper, and began feeding it with bean-stalks, all the time without a candle, the blaze flinging a cheerful shine into the room; though for him the sense of cheerfulness was lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blaze&#8212;to heat water to scald the bristles from the body of an animal that as yet lived, and whose voice could be continually heard from a corner of the garden. At half-past six, the time of appointment with the butcher, the water boiled, and Jude's wife came downstairs.</p>
<p>"Is Challow come?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>They waited, and it grew lighter, with the dreary light of a snowy dawn. She went out, gazed along the road, and returning said, "He's not coming. Drunk last night, I expect. The snow is not enough to hinder him, surely!"</p>
<p>"Then we must put it off. It is only the water boiled for nothing. The snow may be deep in the valley."</p>
<p>"Can't be put off. There's no more victuals for the pig. He ate the last mixing o' barleymeal yesterday morning."</p>
<p>"Yesterday morning? What has he lived on since?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"What&#8212;he has been starving?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We always do it the last day or two, to save bother with the innerds. What ignorance, not to know that!"</p>
<p>"That accounts for his crying so. Poor creature!"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;you must do the sticking&#8212;there's no help for it. I'll show you how. Or I'll do it myself&#8212;I think I could. Though as it is such a big pig I had rather Challow had done it. However, his basket o' knives and things have been already sent on here, and we can use 'em."</p>
<p>"Of course you shan't do it," said Jude. "I'll do it, since it must be done."</p>
<p>He went out to the sty, shovelled away the snow for the space of a couple of yards or more, and placed the stool in front, with the knives and ropes at hand. A robin peered down at the preparations from the nearest tree, and, not liking the sinister look of the scene, flew away, though hungry. By this time Arabella had joined her husband, and Jude, rope in hand, got into the sty, and noosed the affrighted animal, who, beginning with a squeak of surprise, rose to repeated cries of rage. Arabella opened the sty-door, and together they hoisted the victim on to the stool, legs upward, and while Jude held him Arabella bound him down, looping the cord over his legs to keep him from struggling.</p>
<p>The animal's note changed its quality. It was not now rage, but the cry of despair; long-drawn, slow and hopeless.</p>
<p>"Upon my soul I would sooner have gone without the pig than have had this to do!" said Jude. "A creature I have fed with my own hands."</p>
<p>"Don't be such a tender-hearted fool! There's the sticking-knife&#8212;the one with the point. Now whatever you do, don't stick un too deep."</p>
<p>"I'll stick him effectually, so as to make short work of it. That's the chief thing."</p>
<p>"You must not!" she cried. "The meat must be well bled, and to do that he must die slow. We shall lose a shilling a score if the meat is red and bloody! Just touch the vein, that's all. I was brought up to it, and I know. Every good butcher keeps un bleeding long. He ought to be eight or ten minutes dying, at least."</p>
<p>"He shall not be half a minute if I can help it, however the meat may look," said Jude determinedly. Scraping the bristles from the pig's upturned throat, as he had seen the butchers do, he slit the fat; then plunged in the knife with all his might.</p>
<p>"'Od damn it all!" she cried, "that ever I should say it! You've over-stuck un! And I telling you all the time&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Do be quiet, Arabella, and have a little pity on the creature!"</p>
<p>"Hold up the pail to catch the blood, and don't talk!"</p>
<p>However unworkmanlike the deed, it had been mercifully done. The blood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she had desired. The dying animal's cry assumed its third and final tone, the shriek of agony; his glazing eyes riveting themselves on Arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing at last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends.</p>
<p>"Make un stop that!" said Arabella. "Such a noise will bring somebody or other up here, and I don't want people to know we are doing it ourselves." Picking up the knife from the ground whereon Jude had flung it, she slipped it into the gash, and slit the windpipe. The pig was instantly silent, his dying breath coming through the hole.</p>
<p>"That's better," she said.</p>
<p>"It is a hateful business!" said he.</p>
<p>"Pigs must be killed."</p>
<p>The animal heaved in a final convulsion, and, despite the rope, kicked out with all his last strength. A tablespoonful of black clot came forth, the trickling of red blood having ceased for some seconds.</p>
<p>"That's it; now he'll go," said she. "Artful creatures&#8212;they always keep back a drop like that as long as they can!"</p>
<p>The last plunge had come so unexpectedly as to make Jude stagger, and in recovering himself he kicked over the vessel in which the blood had been caught.</p>
<p>"There!" she cried, thoroughly in a passion. "Now I can't make any blackpot. There's a waste, all through you!"</p>
<p>Jude put the pail upright, but only about a third of the whole steaming liquid was left in it, the main part being splashed over the snow, and forming a dismal, sordid, ugly spectacle&#8212;to those who saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat. The lips and nostrils of the animal turned livid, then white, and the muscles of his limbs relaxed.</p>
<p>"Thank God!" Jude said. "He's dead."</p>
<p>"What's God got to do with such a messy job as a pig-killing, I should like to know!" she said scornfully. "Poor folks must live."</p>
<p>"I know, I know," said he. "I don't scold you."</p>
<p>Suddenly they became aware of a voice at hand.</p>
<p>"Well done, young married volk! I couldn't have carried it out much better myself, cuss me if I could!" The voice, which was husky, came from the garden-gate, and looking up from the scene of slaughter they saw the burly form of Mr. Challow leaning over the gate, critically surveying their performance.</p>
<p>"'Tis well for 'ee to stand there and glane!" said Arabella. "Owing to your being late the meat is blooded and half spoiled! 'Twon't fetch so much by a shilling a score!"</p>
<p>Challow expressed his contrition. "You should have waited a bit" he said, shaking his head, "and not have done this&#8212;in the delicate state, too, that you be in at present, ma'am. 'Tis risking yourself too much."</p>
<p>"You needn't be concerned about that," said Arabella, laughing. Jude too laughed, but there was a strong flavour of bitterness in his amusement.</p>
<p>Challow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the scalding and scraping. Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man at what he had done, though aware of his lack of common sense, and that the deed would have amounted to the same thing if carried out by deputy. The white snow, stained with the blood of his fellow-mortal, wore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice, not to say a Christian; but he could not see how the matter was to be mended. No doubt he was, as his wife had called him, a tender-hearted fool.</p>
<p>He did not like the road to Alfredston now. It stared him cynically in the face. The wayside objects reminded him so much of his courtship of his wife that, to keep them out of his eyes, he read whenever he could as he walked to and from his work. Yet he sometimes felt that by caring for books he was not escaping common-place nor gaining rare ideas, every working-man being of that taste now. When passing near the spot by the stream on which he had first made her acquaintance he one day heard voices just as he had done at that earlier time. One of the girls who had been Arabella's companions was talking to a friend in a shed, himself being the subject of discourse, possibly because they had seen him in the distance. They were quite unaware that the shed-walls were so thin that he could hear their words as he passed.</p>
<p>"Howsomever, 'twas I put her up to it! 'Nothing venture nothing have,' I said. If I hadn't she'd no more have been his mis'ess than I."</p>
<p>"'Tis my belief she knew there was nothing the matter when she told him she was&#8230;"</p>
<p>What had Arabella been put up to by this woman, so that he should make her his "mis'ess," otherwise wife? The suggestion was horridly unpleasant, and it rankled in his mind so much that instead of entering his own cottage when he reached it he flung his basket inside the garden-gate and passed on, determined to go and see his old aunt and get some supper there.</p>
<p>This made his arrival home rather late. Arabella however, was busy melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig, for she had been out on a jaunt all day, and so delayed her work. Dreading lest what he had heard should lead him to say something regrettable to her he spoke little. But Arabella was very talkative, and said among other things that she wanted some money. Seeing the book sticking out of his pocket she added that he ought to earn more.</p>
<p>"An apprentice's wages are not meant to be enough to keep a wife on, as a rule, my dear."</p>
<p>"Then you shouldn't have had one."</p>
<p>"Come, Arabella! That's too bad, when you know how it came about."</p>
<p>"I'll declare afore Heaven that I thought what I told you was true. Doctor Vilbert thought so. It was a good job for you that it wasn't so!"</p>
<p>"I don't mean that," he said hastily. "I mean before that time. I know it was not your fault; but those women friends of yours gave you bad advice. If they hadn't, or you hadn't taken it, we should at this moment have been free from a bond which, not to mince matters, galls both of us devilishly. It may be very sad, but it is true."</p>
<p>"Who's been telling you about my friends? What advice? I insist upon you telling me."</p>
<p>"Pooh&#8212;I'd rather not."</p>
<p>"But you shall&#8212;you ought to. It is mean of 'ee not to!"</p>
<p>"Very well." And he hinted gently what had been revealed to him. "But I don't wish to dwell upon it. Let us say no more about it."</p>
<p>Her defensive manner collapsed. "That was nothing," she said, laughing coldly. "Every woman has a right to do such as that. The risk is hers."</p>
<p>"I quite deny it, Bella. She might if no lifelong penalty attached to it for the man, or, in his default, for herself; if the weakness of the moment could end with the moment, or even with the year. But when effects stretch so far she should not go and do that which entraps a man if he is honest, or herself if he is otherwise."</p>
<p>"What ought I to have done?"</p>
