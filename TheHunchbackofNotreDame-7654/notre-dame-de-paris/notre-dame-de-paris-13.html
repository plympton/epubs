<h2 id="dlepubid00049">CHAPTER VIII. THE UTILITY OF WINDOWS WHICH OPEN ON THE RIVER.</h2>
<p>Claude Frollo (for we presume that the reader, more intelligent than Phoebus, has seen in this whole adventure no other surly monk than the archdeacon), Claude Frollo groped about for several moments in the dark lair into which the captain had bolted him. It was one of those nooks which architects sometimes reserve at the point of junction between the roof and the supporting wall. A vertical section of this kennel, as Phoebus had so justly styled it, would have made a triangle. Moreover, there was neither window nor air-hole, and the slope of the roof prevented one from standing upright. Accordingly, Claude crouched down in the dust, and the plaster which cracked beneath him; his head was on fire; rummaging around him with his hands, he found on the floor a bit of broken glass, which he pressed to his brow, and whose cool-ness afforded him some relief.</p>
<p>What was taking place at that moment in the gloomy soul of the archdeacon? God and himself could alone know.</p>
<p>In what order was he arranging in his mind la Esmeralda, Phoebus, Jacques Charmolue, his young brother so beloved, yet abandoned by him in the mire, his archdeacon's cassock, his reputation perhaps dragged to la Falourdel's, all these adventures, all these images? I cannot say. But it is certain that these ideas formed in his mind a horrible group.</p>
<p>He had been waiting a quarter of an hour; it seemed to him that he had grown a century older. All at once he heard the creaking of the boards of the stairway; some one was ascending. The trapdoor opened once more; a light reappeared. There was a tolerably large crack in the worm-eaten door of his den; he put his face to it. In this manner he could see all that went on in the adjoining room. The cat-faced old crone was the first to emerge from the trap-door, lamp in hand; then Phoebus, twirling his moustache, then a third person, that beautiful and graceful figure, la Esmeralda. The priest beheld her rise from below like a dazzling apparition. Claude trembled, a cloud spread over his eyes, his pulses beat violently, everything rustled and whirled around him; he no longer saw nor heard anything.</p>
<p>When he recovered himself, Phoebus and Esmeralda were alone seated on the wooden coffer beside the lamp which made these two youthful figures and a miserable pallet at the end of the attic stand out plainly before the archdeacon's eyes.</p>
<p>Beside the pallet was a window, whose panes broken like a spider's web upon which rain has fallen, allowed a view, through its rent meshes, of a corner of the sky, and the moon lying far away on an eiderdown bed of soft clouds.</p>
<p>The young girl was blushing, confused, palpitating. Her long, drooping lashes shaded her crimson cheeks. The officer, to whom she dared not lift her eyes, was radiant. Mechanically, and with a charmingly unconscious gesture, she traced with the tip of her finger incoherent lines on the bench, and watched her finger. Her foot was not visible. The little goat was nestling upon it.</p>
<p>The captain was very gallantly clad; he had tufts of embroidery at his neck and wrists; a great elegance at that day.</p>
<p>It was not without difficulty that Dom Claude managed to hear what they were saying, through the humming of the blood, which was boiling in his temples.</p>
<p>(A conversation between lovers is a very commonplace affair. It is a perpetual "I love you." A musical phrase which is very insipid and very bald for indifferent listeners, when it is not ornamented with some <i>fioriture</i>; but Claude was not an indifferent listener.)</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the young girl, without raising her eyes, "do not despise me, monseigneur Phoebus. I feel that what I am doing is not right."</p>
<p>"Despise you, my pretty child!" replied the officer with an air of superior and distinguished gallantry, "despise you, <i>t&#234;te-Dieu</i>! and why?"</p>
<p>"For having followed you!"</p>
<p>"On that point, my beauty, we don't agree. I ought not to despise you, but to hate you."</p>
<p>The young girl looked at him in affright: "Hate me! what have I done?"</p>
<p>"For having required so much urging."</p>
<p>"Alas!" said she, "'tis because I am breaking a vow. I shall not find my parents! The amulet will lose its virtue. But what matters it? What need have I of father or mother now?"</p>
<p>So saying, she fixed upon the captain her great black eyes, moist with joy and tenderness.</p>
<p>"Devil take me if I understand you!" exclaimed Phoebus. La Esmeralda remained silent for a moment, then a tear dropped from her eyes, a sigh from her lips, and she said,&#8212;"Oh! monseigneur, I love you."</p>
<p>Such a perfume of chastity, such a charm of virtue surrounded the young girl, that Phoebus did not feel completely at his ease beside her. But this remark emboldened him: "You love me!" he said with rapture, and he threw his arm round the gypsy's waist. He had only been waiting for this opportunity.</p>
<p>The priest saw it, and tested with the tip of his finger the point of a poniard which he wore concealed in his breast.</p>
<p>"Phoebus," continued the Bohemian, gently releasing her waist from the captain's tenacious hands, "You are good, you are generous, you are handsome; you saved me, me who am only a poor child lost in Bohemia. I had long been dreaming of an officer who should save my life. 'Twas of you that I was dreaming, before I knew you, my Phoebus; the officer of my dream had a beautiful uniform like yours, a grand look, a sword; your name is Phoebus; 'tis a beautiful name. I love your name; I love your sword. Draw your sword, Phoebus, that I may see it."</p>
<p>"Child!" said the captain, and he unsheathed his sword with a smile.</p>
<p>The gypsy looked at the hilt, the blade; examined the cipher on the guard with adorable curiosity, and kissed the sword, saying,&#8212;</p>
<p>"You are the sword of a brave man. I love my captain." Phoebus again profited by the opportunity to impress upon her beautiful bent neck a kiss which made the young girl straighten herself up as scarlet as a poppy. The priest gnashed his teeth over it in the dark.</p>
<p>"Phoebus," resumed the gypsy, "let me talk to you. Pray walk a little, that I may see you at full height, and that I may hear your spurs jingle. How handsome you are!"</p>
<p>The captain rose to please her, chiding her with a smile of satisfaction,&#8212;</p>
<p>"What a child you are! By the way, my charmer, have you seen me in my archer's ceremonial doublet?"</p>
<p>"Alas! no," she replied.</p>
<p>"It is very handsome!"</p>
<p>Phoebus returned and seated himself beside her, but much closer than before.</p>
<p>"Listen, my dear&#8212;"</p>
<p>The gypsy gave him several little taps with her pretty hand on his mouth, with a childish mirth and grace and gayety.</p>
<p>"No, no, I will not listen to you. Do you love me? I want you to tell me whether you love me."</p>
<p>"Do I love thee, angel of my life!" exclaimed the captain, half kneeling. "My body, my blood, my soul, all are thine; all are for thee. I love thee, and I have never loved any one but thee."</p>
<p>The captain had repeated this phrase so many times, in many similar conjunctures, that he delivered it all in one breath, without committing a single mistake. At this passionate declaration, the gypsy raised to the dirty ceiling which served for the skies a glance full of angelic happiness.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she murmured, "this is the moment when one should die!"</p>
<p>Phoebus found "the moment" favorable for robbing her of another kiss, which went to torture the unhappy archdeacon in his nook. "Die!" exclaimed the amorous captain, "What are you saying, my lovely angel? 'Tis a time for living, or Jupiter is only a scamp! Die at the beginning of so sweet a thing! <i>Corne-de-boeuf</i>, what a jest! It is not that. Listen, my dear Similar, Esmenarda&#8212;Pardon! you have so prodigiously Saracen a name that I never can get it straight. 'Tis a thicket which stops me short."</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" said the poor girl, "and I thought my name pretty because of its singularity! But since it displeases you, I would that I were called Goton."</p>
<p>"Ah! do not weep for such a trifle, my graceful maid! 'tis a name to which one must get accustomed, that is all. When I once know it by heart, all will go smoothly. Listen then, my dear Similar; I adore you passionately. I love you so that 'tis simply miraculous. I know a girl who is bursting with rage over it&#8212;"</p>
<p>The jealous girl interrupted him: "Who?"</p>
<p>"What matters that to us?" said Phoebus; "do you love me?"</p>
<p>"Oh!"&#8212;said she.</p>
<p>"Well! that is all. You shall see how I love you also. May the great devil Neptunus spear me if I do not make you the happiest woman in the world. We will have a pretty little house somewhere. I will make my archers parade before your windows. They are all mounted, and set at defiance those of Captain Mignon. There are <i>voulgiers, cranequiniers</i> and hand <i>couleveiniers</i>*. I will take you to the great sights of the Parisians at the storehouse of Rully. Eighty thousand armed men, thirty thousand white harnesses, short coats or coats of mail; the sixty-seven banners of the trades; the standards of the parliaments, of the chamber of accounts, of the treasury of the generals, of the aides of the mint; a devilish fine array, in short! I will conduct you to see the lions of the H&#244;tel du Roi, which are wild beasts. All women love that."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; * Varieties of the crossbow.<br>
</div>
<p>For several moments the young girl, absorbed in her charming thoughts, was dreaming to the sound of his voice, without listening to the sense of his words.</p>
<p>"Oh! how happy you will be!" continued the captain, and at the same time he gently unbuckled the gypsy's girdle.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she said quickly. This "act of violence" had roused her from her revery.</p>
<p>"Nothing," replied Phoebus, "I was only saying that you must abandon all this garb of folly, and the street corner when you are with me."</p>
<p>"When I am with you, Phoebus!" said the young girl tenderly.</p>
<p>She became pensive and silent once more.</p>
<p>The captain, emboldened by her gentleness, clasped her waist without resistance; then began softly to unlace the poor child's corsage, and disarranged her tucker to such an extent that the panting priest beheld the gypsy's beautiful shoulder emerge from the gauze, as round and brown as the moon rising through the mists of the horizon.</p>
<p>The young girl allowed Phoebus to have his way. She did not appear to perceive it. The eye of the bold captain flashed.</p>
<p>Suddenly she turned towards him,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Phoebus," she said, with an expression of infinite love, "instruct me in thy religion."</p>
<p>"My religion!" exclaimed the captain, bursting with laughter, "I instruct you in my religion! <i>Corne et tonnerre</i>! What do you want with my religion?"</p>
<p>"In order that we may be married," she replied.</p>
<p>The captain's face assumed an expression of mingled surprise and disdain, of carelessness and libertine passion.</p>
<p>"Ah, bah!" said he, "do people marry?"</p>
<p>The Bohemian turned pale, and her head drooped sadly on her breast.</p>
<p>"My beautiful love," resumed Phoebus, tenderly, "what nonsense is this? A great thing is marriage, truly! one is none the less loving for not having spit Latin into a priest's shop!"</p>
<p>While speaking thus in his softest voice, he approached extremely near the gypsy; his caressing hands resumed their place around her supple and delicate waist, his eye flashed more and more, and everything announced that Monsieur Phoebus was on the verge of one of those moments when Jupiter himself commits so many follies that Homer is obliged to summon a cloud to his rescue.</p>
<p>But Dom Claude saw everything. The door was made of thoroughly rotten cask staves, which left large apertures for the passage of his hawklike gaze. This brown-skinned, broad-shouldered priest, hitherto condemned to the austere virginity of the cloister, was quivering and boiling in the presence of this night scene of love and voluptuousness. This young and beautiful girl given over in disarray to the ardent young man, made melted lead flow in his-veins; his eyes darted with sensual jealousy beneath all those loosened pins. Any one who could, at that moment, have seen the face of the unhappy man glued to the wormeaten bars, would have thought that he beheld the face of a tiger glaring from the depths of a cage at some jackal devouring a gazelle. His eye shone like a candle through the cracks of the door.</p>
<p>All at once, Phoebus, with a rapid gesture, removed the gypsy's gorgerette. The poor child, who had remained pale and dreamy, awoke with a start; she recoiled hastily from the enterprising officer, and, casting a glance at her bare neck and shoulders, red, confused, mute with shame, she crossed her two beautiful arms on her breast to conceal it. Had it not been for the flame which burned in her cheeks, at the sight of her so silent and motionless, one would have declared her a statue of Modesty. Her eyes were lowered.</p>
<p>But the captain's gesture had revealed the mysterious amulet which she wore about her neck.</p>
<p>"What is that?" he said, seizing this pretext to approach once more the beautiful creature whom he had just alarmed.</p>
<p>"Don't touch it!" she replied, quickly, "'tis my guardian. It will make me find my family again, if I remain worthy to do so. Oh, leave me, monsieur le capitaine! My mother! My poor mother! My mother! Where art thou? Come to my rescue! Have pity, Monsieur Phoebus, give me back my gorgerette!"</p>
<p>Phoebus retreated amid said in a cold tone,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Oh, mademoiselle! I see plainly that you do not love me!"</p>
<p>"I do not love him!" exclaimed the unhappy child, and at the same time she clung to the captain, whom she drew to a seat beside her. "I do not love thee, my Phoebus? What art thou saying, wicked man, to break my heart? Oh, take me! take all! do what you will with me, I am thine. What matters to me the amulet! What matters to me my mother! 'Tis thou who art my mother since I love thee! Phoebus, my beloved Phoebus, dost thou see me? 'Tis I. Look at me; 'tis the little one whom thou wilt surely not repulse, who comes, who comes herself to seek thee. My soul, my life, my body, my person, all is one thing&#8212;which is thine, my captain. Well, no! We will not marry, since that displeases thee; and then, what am I? a miserable girl of the gutters; whilst thou, my Phoebus, art a gentleman. A fine thing, truly! A dancer wed an officer! I was mad. No, Phoebus, no; I will be thy mistress, thy amusement, thy pleasure, when thou wilt; a girl who shall belong to thee. I was only made for that, soiled, despised, dishonored, but what matters it?&#8212;beloved. I shall be the proudest and the most joyous of women. And when I grow old or ugly, Phoebus, when I am no longer good to love you, you will suffer me to serve you still. Others will embroider scarfs for you; 'tis I, the servant, who will care for them. You will let me polish your spurs, brush your doublet, dust your riding-boots. You will have that pity, will you not, Phoebus? Meanwhile, take me! here, Phoebus, all this belongs to thee, only love me! We gypsies need only air and love."</p>
<p>So saying, she threw her arms round the officer's neck; she looked up at him, supplicatingly, with a beautiful smile, and all in tears. Her delicate neck rubbed against his cloth doublet with its rough embroideries. She writhed on her knees, her beautiful body half naked. The intoxicated captain pressed his ardent lips to those lovely African shoulders. The young girl, her eyes bent on the ceiling, as she leaned backwards, quivered, all palpitating, beneath this kiss.</p>
<p>All at once, above Phoebus's head she beheld another head; a green, livid, convulsed face, with the look of a lost soul; near this face was a hand grasping a poniard.&#8212;It was the face and hand of the priest; he had broken the door and he was there. Phoebus could not see him. The young girl remained motionless, frozen with terror, dumb, beneath that terrible apparition, like a dove which should raise its head at the moment when the hawk is gazing into her nest with its round eyes.</p>
<p>She could not even utter a cry. She saw the poniard descend upon Phoebus, and rise again, reeking.</p>
<p>"Maledictions!" said the captain, and fell.</p>
<p>She fainted.</p>
<p>At the moment when her eyes closed, when all feeling vanished in her, she thought that she felt a touch of fire imprinted upon her lips, a kiss more burning than the red-hot iron of the executioner.</p>
<p>When she recovered her senses, she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the captain, bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her,</p>
<p>"'Tis a sorceress who has stabbed a captain."</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00051">CHAPTER I. THE CROWN CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF.</h2>
<p>Gringoire and the entire Court of Miracles were suffering mortal anxiety. For a whole month they had not known what had become of la Esmeralda, which greatly pained the Duke of Egypt and his friends the vagabonds, nor what had become of the goat, which redoubled Gringoire's grief. One evening the gypsy had disappeared, and since that time had given no signs of life. All search had proved fruitless. Some tormenting bootblacks had told Gringoire about meeting her that same evening near the Pont Saint-Michel, going off with an officer; but this husband, after the fashion of Bohemia, was an incredulous philosopher, and besides, he, better than any one else, knew to what a point his wife was virginal. He had been able to form a judgment as to the unconquerable modesty resulting from the combined virtues of the amulet and the gypsy, and he had mathematically calculated the resistance of that chastity to the second power. Accordingly, he was at ease on that score.</p>
<p>Still he could not understand this disappearance. It was a profound sorrow. He would have grown thin over it, had that been possible. He had forgotten everything, even his literary tastes, even his great work, <i>De figuris regularibus et irregularibus</i>, which it was his intention to have printed with the first money which he should procure (for he had raved over printing, ever since he had seen the "Didascalon" of Hugues de Saint Victor, printed with the celebrated characters of Vindelin de Spire).</p>
<p>One day, as he was passing sadly before the criminal Tournelle, he perceived a considerable crowd at one of the gates of the Palais de Justice.</p>
<p>"What is this?" he inquired of a young man who was coming out.</p>
<p>"I know not, sir," replied the young man. "'Tis said that they are trying a woman who hath assassinated a gendarme. It appears that there is sorcery at the bottom of it, the archbishop and the official have intervened in the case, and my brother, who is the archdeacon of Josas, can think of nothing else. Now, I wished to speak with him, but I have not been able to reach him because of the throng, which vexes me greatly, as I stand in need of money."</p>
<p>"Alas! sir," said Gringoire, "I would that I could lend you some, but, my breeches are worn to holes, and 'tis not crowns which have done it."</p>
<p>He dared not tell the young man that he was acquainted with his brother the archdeacon, to whom he had not returned after the scene in the church; a negligence which embarrassed him.</p>
<p>The scholar went his way, and Gringoire set out to follow the crowd which was mounting the staircase of the great chamber. In his opinion, there was nothing like the spectacle of a criminal process for dissipating melancholy, so exhilaratingly stupid are judges as a rule. The populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence. After a slow and tiresome march through a long, gloomy corridor, which wound through the court-house like the intestinal canal of the ancient edifice, he arrived near a low door, opening upon a hall which his lofty stature permitted him to survey with a glance over the waving heads of the rabble.</p>
<p>The hall was vast and gloomy, which latter fact made it appear still more spacious. The day was declining; the long, pointed windows permitted only a pale ray of light to enter, which was extinguished before it reached the vaulted ceiling, an enormous trellis-work of sculptured beams, whose thousand figures seemed to move confusedly in the shadows, many candles were already lighted here and there on tables, and beaming on the heads of clerks buried in masses of documents. The anterior portion of the ball was occupied by the crowd; on the right and left were magistrates and tables; at the end, upon a platform, a number of judges, whose rear rank sank into the shadows, sinister and motionless faces. The walls were sown with innumerable fleurs-de-lis. A large figure of Christ might be vaguely descried above the judges, and everywhere there were pikes and halberds, upon whose points the reflection of the candles placed tips of fire.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," Gringoire inquired of one of his neighbors, "who are all those persons ranged yonder, like prelates in council?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur," replied the neighbor, "those on the right are the counsellors of the grand chamber; those on the left, the councillors of inquiry; the masters in black gowns, the messires in red."</p>
<p>"Who is that big red fellow, yonder above them, who is sweating?" pursued Gringoire.</p>
<p>"It is monsieur the president."</p>
<p>"And those sheep behind him?" continued Gringoire, who as we have seen, did not love the magistracy, which arose, possibly, from the grudge which he cherished against the Palais de Justice since his dramatic misadventure.</p>
<p>"They are messieurs the masters of requests of the king's household."</p>
<p>"And that boar in front of him?"</p>
<p>"He is monsieur the clerk of the Court of Parliament."</p>
<p>"And that crocodile on the right?"</p>
<p>"Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king."</p>
<p>"And that big, black tom-cat on the left?"</p>
<p>"Master Jacques Charmolue, procurator of the king in the Ecclesiastical Court, with the gentlemen of the officialty."</p>
<p>"Come now, monsieur," said Gringoire, "pray what are all those fine fellows doing yonder?"</p>
<p>"They are judging."</p>
<p>"Judging whom? I do not see the accused."</p>
<p>"'Tis a woman, sir. You cannot see her. She has her back turned to us, and she is hidden from us by the crowd. Stay, yonder she is, where you see a group of partisans."</p>
<p>"Who is the woman?" asked Gringoire. "Do you know her name?"</p>
<p>"No, monsieur, I have but just arrived. I merely assume that there is some sorcery about it, since the official is present at the trial."</p>
<p>"Come!" said our philosopher, "we are going to see all these magistrates devour human flesh. 'Tis as good a spectacle as any other."</p>
<p>"Monsieur," remarked his neighbor, "think you not, that Master Jacques Charmolue has a very sweet air?"</p>
<p>"Hum!" replied Gringoire. "I distrust a sweetness which hath pinched nostrils and thin lips."</p>
<p>Here the bystanders imposed silence upon the two chatterers. They were listening to an important deposition.</p>
<p>"Messeigneurs," said an old woman in the middle of the hall, whose form was so concealed beneath her garments that one would have pronounced her a walking heap of rags; "Messeigneurs, the thing is as true as that I am la Falourdel, established these forty years at the Pont Saint Michel, and paying regularly my rents, lord's dues, and quit rents; at the gate opposite the house of Tassin-Caillart, the dyer, which is on the side up the river&#8212;a poor old woman now, but a pretty maid in former days, my lords. Some one said to me lately, 'La Falourdel, don't use your spinning-wheel too much in the evening; the devil is fond of combing the distaffs of old women with his horns. 'Tis certain that the surly monk who was round about the temple last year, now prowls in the City. Take care, La Falourdel, that he doth not knock at your door.' One evening I was spinning on my wheel, there comes a knock at my door; I ask who it is. They swear. I open. Two men enter. A man in black and a handsome officer. Of the black man nothing could be seen but his eyes, two coals of fire. All the rest was hat and cloak. They say to me,&#8212;'The Sainte-Marthe chamber.'&#8212;'Tis my upper chamber, my lords, my cleanest. They give me a crown. I put the crown in my drawer, and I say: 'This shall go to buy tripe at the slaughter-house of la Gloriette to-morrow.' We go up stairs. On arriving at the upper chamber, and while my back is turned, the black man disappears. That dazed me a bit. The officer, who was as handsome as a great lord, goes down stairs again with me. He goes out. In about the time it takes to spin a quarter of a handful of flax, he returns with a beautiful young girl, a doll who would have shone like the sun had she been coiffed. She had with her a goat; a big billy-goat, whether black or white, I no longer remember. That set me to thinking. The girl does not concern me, but the goat! I love not those beasts, they have a beard and horns. They are so like a man. And then, they smack of the witches, sabbath. However, I say nothing. I had the crown. That is right, is it not, Monsieur Judge? I show the captain and the wench to the upper chamber, and I leave them alone; that is to say, with the goat. I go down and set to spinning again&#8212;I must inform you that my house has a ground floor and story above. I know not why I fell to thinking of the surly monk whom the goat had put into my head again, and then the beautiful girl was rather strangely decked out. All at once, I hear a cry upstairs, and something falls on the floor and the window opens. I run to mine which is beneath it, and I behold a black mass pass before my eyes and fall into the water. It was a phantom clad like a priest. It was a moonlight night. I saw him quite plainly. He was swimming in the direction of the city. Then, all of a tremble, I call the watch. The gentlemen of the police enter, and not knowing just at the first moment what the matter was, and being merry, they beat me. I explain to them. We go up stairs, and what do we find? my poor chamber all blood, the captain stretched out at full length with a dagger in his neck, the girl pretending to be dead, and the goat all in a fright. 'Pretty work!' I say, 'I shall have to wash that floor for more than a fortnight. It will have to be scraped; it will be a terrible job.' They carried off the officer, poor young man, and the wench with her bosom all bare. But wait, the worst is that on the next day, when I wanted to take the crown to buy tripe, I found a dead leaf in its place."</p>
<p>The old woman ceased. A murmur of horror ran through the audience.</p>
<p>"That phantom, that goat,&#8212;all smacks of magic," said one of Gringoire's neighbors.</p>
<p>"And that dry leaf!" added another.</p>
<p>"No doubt about it," joined in a third, "she is a witch who has dealings with the surly monk, for the purpose of plundering officers."</p>
<p>Gringoire himself was not disinclined to regard this as altogether alarming and probable.</p>
<p>"Goody Falourdel," said the president majestically, "have you nothing more to communicate to the court?"</p>
<p>"No, monseigneur," replied the crone, "except that the report has described my house as a hovel and stinking; which is an outrageous fashion of speaking. The houses on the bridge are not imposing, because there are such multitudes of people; but, nevertheless, the butchers continue to dwell there, who are wealthy folk, and married to very proper and handsome women."</p>
<p>The magistrate who had reminded Gringoire of a crocodile rose,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Silence!" said he. "I pray the gentlemen not to lose sight of the fact that a dagger was found on the person of the accused. Goody Falourdel, have you brought that leaf into which the crown which the demon gave you was transformed?</p>
<p>"Yes, monseigneur," she replied; "I found it again. Here it is."</p>
<p>A bailiff banded the dead leaf to the crocodile, who made a doleful shake of the head, and passed it on to the president, who gave it to the procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, and thus it made the circuit of the hail.</p>
<p>"It is a birch leaf," said Master Jacques Charmolue. "A fresh proof of magic."</p>
<p>A counsellor took up the word.</p>
<p>"Witness, two men went upstairs together in your house: the black man, whom you first saw disappear and afterwards swimming in the Seine, with his priestly garments, and the officer. Which of the two handed you the crown?" The old woman pondered for a moment and then said,&#8212;"The officer."</p>
<p>A murmur ran through the crowd.</p>
<p>"Ah!" thought Gringoire, "this makes some doubt in my mind."</p>
<p>But Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary to the king, interposed once more.</p>
<p>"I will recall to these gentlemen, that in the deposition taken at his bedside, the assassinated officer, while declaring that he had a vague idea when the black man accosted him that the latter might be the surly monk, added that the phantom had pressed him eagerly to go and make acquaintance with the accused; and upon his, the captain's, remarking that he had no money, he had given him the crown which the said officer paid to la Falourdel. Hence, that crown is the money of hell."</p>
<p>This conclusive observation appeared to dissipate all the doubts of Gringoire and the other sceptics in the audience.</p>
<p>"You have the documents, gentlemen," added the king's advocate, as he took his seat; "you can consult the testimony of Phoebus de Ch&#226;teaupers."</p>
<p>At that name, the accused sprang up, her head rose above the throng. Gringoire with horror recognized la Esmeralda.</p>
<p>She was pale; her tresses, formerly so gracefully braided and spangled with sequins, hung in disorder; her lips were blue, her hollow eyes were terrible. Alas!</p>
<p>"Phoebus!" she said, in bewilderment; "where is he? O messeigneurs! before you kill me, tell me, for pity sake, whether he still lives?"</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, woman," replied the president, "that is no affair of ours."</p>
<p>"Oh! for mercy's sake, tell me if he is alive!" she repeated, clasping her beautiful emaciated hands; and the sound of her chains in contact with her dress, was heard.</p>
<p>"Well!" said the king's advocate roughly, "he is dying. Are you satisfied?"</p>
<p>The unhappy girl fell back on her criminal's seat, speechless, tearless, white as a wax figure.</p>
<p>The president bent down to a man at his feet, who wore a gold cap and a black gown, a chain on his neck and a wand in his hand.</p>
<p>"Bailiff, bring in the second accused."</p>
<p>All eyes turned towards a small door, which opened, and, to the great agitation of Gringoire, gave passage to a pretty goat with horns and hoofs of gold. The elegant beast halted for a moment on the threshold, stretching out its neck as though, perched on the summit of a rock, it had before its eyes an immense horizon. Suddenly it caught sight of the gypsy girl, and leaping over the table and the head of a clerk, in two bounds it was at her knees; then it rolled gracefully on its mistress's feet, soliciting a word or a caress; but the accused remained motionless, and poor Djali himself obtained not a glance.</p>
<p>"Eh, why&#8212;'tis my villanous beast," said old Falourdel, "I recognize the two perfectly!"</p>
<p>Jacques Charmolue interfered.</p>
<p>"If the gentlemen please, we will proceed to the examination of the goat." He was, in fact, the second criminal. Nothing more simple in those days than a suit of sorcery instituted against an animal. We find, among others in the accounts of the provost's office for 1466, a curious detail concerning the expenses of the trial of Gillet-Soulart and his sow, "executed for their demerits," at Corbeil. Everything is there, the cost of the pens in which to place the sow, the five hundred bundles of brushwood purchased at the port of Morsant, the three pints of wine and the bread, the last repast of the victim fraternally shared by the executioner, down to the eleven days of guard and food for the sow, at eight deniers parisis each. Sometimes, they went even further than animals. The capitularies of Charlemagne and of Louis le D&#233;bonnaire impose severe penalties on fiery phantoms which presume to appear in the air.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the procurator had exclaimed: "If the demon which possesses this goat, and which has resisted all exorcisms, persists in its deeds of witchcraft, if it alarms the court with them, we warn it that we shall be forced to put in requisition against it the gallows or the stake. Gringoire broke out into a cold perspiration. Charmolue took from the table the gypsy's tambourine, and presenting it to the goat, in a certain manner, asked the latter,&#8212;</p>
<p>"What o'clock is it?"</p>
<p>The goat looked at it with an intelligent eye, raised its gilded hoof, and struck seven blows.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, seven o'clock. A movement of terror ran through the crowd.</p>
<p>Gringoire could not endure it.</p>
<p>"He is destroying himself!" he cried aloud; "You see well that he does not know what he is doing."</p>
<p>"Silence among the louts at the end of the hail!" said the bailiff sharply.</p>
<p>Jacques Charmolue, by the aid of the same manoeuvres of the tambourine, made the goat perform many other tricks connected with the date of the day, the month of the year, etc., which the reader has already witnessed. And, by virtue of an optical illusion peculiar to judicial proceedings, these same spectators who had, probably, more than once applauded in the public square Djali's innocent magic were terrified by it beneath the roof of the Palais de Justice. The goat was undoubtedly the devil.</p>
<p>It was far worse when the procurator of the king, having emptied upon a floor a certain bag filled with movable letters, which Djali wore round his neck, they beheld the goat extract with his hoof from the scattered alphabet the fatal name of Phoebus. The witchcraft of which the captain had been the victim appeared irresistibly demonstrated, and in the eyes of all, the gypsy, that ravishing dancer, who had so often dazzled the passers-by with her grace, was no longer anything but a frightful vampire.</p>
<p>However, she betrayed no sign of life; neither Djali's graceful evolutions, nor the menaces of the court, nor the suppressed imprecations of the spectators any longer reached her mind.</p>
<p>In order to arouse her, a police officer was obliged to shake her unmercifully, and the president had to raise his voice,&#8212;"Girl, you are of the Bohemian race, addicted to deeds of witchcraft. You, in complicity with the bewitched goat implicated in this suit, during the night of the twenty-ninth of March last, murdered and stabbed, in concert with the powers of darkness, by the aid of charms and underhand practices, a captain of the king's arches of the watch, Phoebus de Ch&#226;teaupers. Do you persist in denying it?"</p>
<p>"Horror!" exclaimed the young girl, hiding her face in her hands. "My Phoebus! Oh, this is hell!"</p>
<p>"Do you persist in your denial?" demanded the president coldly.</p>
<p>"Do I deny it?" she said with terrible accents; and she rose with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>The president continued squarely,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Then how do you explain the facts laid to your charge?"</p>
<p>She replied in a broken voice,&#8212;</p>
<p>"I have already told you. I do not know. 'Twas a priest, a priest whom I do not know; an infernal priest who pursues me!"</p>
<p>"That is it," retorted the judge; "the surly monk."</p>
<p>"Oh, gentlemen! have mercy! I am but a poor girl&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Of Egypt," said the judge.</p>
<p>Master Jacques Charmolue interposed sweetly,&#8212;</p>
<p>"In view of the sad obstinacy of the accused, I demand the application of the torture."</p>
<p>"Granted," said the president.</p>
<p>The unhappy girl quivered in every limb. But she rose at the command of the men with partisans, and walked with a tolerably firm step, preceded by Charmolue and the priests of the officiality, between two rows of halberds, towards a medium-sized door which suddenly opened and closed again behind her, and which produced upon the grief-stricken Gringoire the effect of a horrible mouth which had just devoured her.</p>
<p>When she disappeared, they heard a plaintive bleating; it was the little goat mourning.</p>
<p>The sitting of the court was suspended. A counsellor having remarked that the gentlemen were fatigued, and that it would be a long time to wait until the torture was at an end, the president replied that a magistrate must know how to sacrifice himself to his duty.</p>
<p>"What an annoying and vexatious hussy," said an aged judge, "to get herself put to the question when one has not supped!"</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00052">CHAPTER II. CONTINUATION OF THE CROWN WHICH WAS CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF.</h2>
<p>After ascending and descending several steps in the corridors, which were so dark that they were lighted by lamps at mid-day, La Esmeralda, still surrounded by her lugubrious escort, was thrust by the police into a gloomy chamber. This chamber, circular in form, occupied the ground floor of one of those great towers, which, even in our own century, still pierce through the layer of modern edifices with which modern Paris has covered ancient Paris. There were no windows to this cellar; no other opening than the entrance, which was low, and closed by an enormous iron door. Nevertheless, light was not lacking; a furnace had been constructed in the thickness of the wall; a large fire was lighted there, which filled the vault with its crimson reflections and deprived a miserable candle, which stood in one corner, of all radiance. The iron grating which served to close the oven, being raised at that moment, allowed only a view at the mouth of the flaming vent-hole in the dark wall, the lower extremity of its bars, like a row of black and pointed teeth, set flat apart; which made the furnace resemble one of those mouths of dragons which spout forth flames in ancient legends. By the light which escaped from it, the prisoner beheld, all about the room, frightful instruments whose use she did not understand. In the centre lay a leather mattress, placed almost flat upon the ground, over which hung a strap provided with a buckle, attached to a brass ring in the mouth of a flat-nosed monster carved in the keystone of the vault. Tongs, pincers, large ploughshares, filled the interior of the furnace, and glowed in a confused heap on the coals. The sanguine light of the furnace illuminated in the chamber only a confused mass of horrible things.</p>
<p>This Tartarus was called simply, The Question Chamber.</p>
<p>On the bed, in a negligent attitude, sat Pierrat Torterue, the official torturer. His underlings, two gnomes with square faces, leather aprons, and linen breeches, were moving the iron instruments on the coals.</p>
<p>In vain did the poor girl summon up her courage; on entering this chamber she was stricken with horror.</p>
<p>The sergeants of the bailiff of the courts drew up in line on one side, the priests of the officiality on the other. A clerk, inkhorn, and a table were in one corner.</p>
<p>Master Jacques Charmolue approached the gypsy with a very sweet smile.</p>
<p>"My dear child," said he, "do you still persist in your denial?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied, in a dying voice.</p>
<p>"In that case," replied Charmolue, "it will be very painful for us to have to question you more urgently than we should like. Pray take the trouble to seat yourself on this bed. Master Pierrat, make room for mademoiselle, and close the door."</p>
<p>Pierrat rose with a growl.</p>
<p>"If I shut the door," he muttered, "my fire will go out."</p>
<p>"Well, my dear fellow," replied Charmolue, "leave it open then."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, la Esmeralda had remained standing. That leather bed on which so many unhappy wretches had writhed, frightened her. Terror chilled the very marrow of her bones; she stood there bewildered and stupefied. At a sign from Charmolue, the two assistants took her and placed her in a sitting posture on the bed. They did her no harm; but when these men touched her, when that leather touched her, she felt all her blood retreat to her heart. She cast a frightened look around the chamber. It seemed to her as though she beheld advancing from all quarters towards her, with the intention of crawling up her body and biting and pinching her, all those hideous implements of torture, which as compared to the instruments of all sorts she had hitherto seen, were like what bats, centipedes, and spiders are among insects and birds.</p>
<p>"Where is the physician?" asked Charmolue.</p>
<p>"Here," replied a black gown whom she had not before noticed.</p>
<p>She shuddered.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," resumed the caressing voice of the procucrator of the Ecclesiastical court, "for the third time, do you persist in denying the deeds of which you are accused?"</p>
<p>This time she could only make a sign with her head.</p>
<p>"You persist?" said Jacques Charmolue. "Then it grieves me deeply, but I must fulfil my office."</p>
<p>"Monsieur le Procureur du Roi," said Pierrat abruptly, "How shall we begin?"</p>
<p>Charmolue hesitated for a moment with the ambiguous grimace of a poet in search of a rhyme.</p>
<p>"With the boot," he said at last.</p>
<p>The unfortunate girl felt herself so utterly abandoned by God and men, that her head fell upon her breast like an inert thing which has no power in itself.</p>
<p>The tormentor and the physician approached her simultaneously. At the same time, the two assistants began to fumble among their hideous arsenal.</p>
<p>At the clanking of their frightful irons, the unhappy child quivered like a dead frog which is being galvanized. "Oh!" she murmured, so low that no one heard her; "Oh, my Phoebus!" Then she fell back once more into her immobility and her marble silence. This spectacle would have rent any other heart than those of her judges. One would have pronounced her a poor sinful soul, being tortured by Satan beneath the scarlet wicket of hell. The miserable body which that frightful swarm of saws, wheels, and racks were about to clasp in their clutches, the being who was about to be manipulated by the harsh hands of executioners and pincers, was that gentle, white, fragile creature, a poor grain of millet which human justice was handing over to the terrible mills of torture to grind. Meanwhile, the callous hands of Pierrat Torterue's assistants had bared that charming leg, that tiny foot, which had so often amazed the passers-by with their delicacy and beauty, in the squares of Paris.</p>
<p>"'Tis a shame!" muttered the tormentor, glancing at these graceful and delicate forms.</p>
<p>Had the archdeacon been present, he certainly would have recalled at that moment his symbol of the spider and the fly. Soon the unfortunate girl, through a mist which spread before her eyes, beheld the boot approach; she soon beheld her foot encased between iron plates disappear in the frightful apparatus. Then terror restored her strength.</p>
<p>"Take that off!" she cried angrily; and drawing herself up, with her hair all dishevelled: "Mercy!"</p>
<p>She darted from the bed to fling herself at the feet of the king's procurator, but her leg was fast in the heavy block of oak and iron, and she sank down upon the boot, more crushed than a bee with a lump of lead on its wing.</p>
<p>At a sign from Charmolue, she was replaced on the bed, and two coarse hands adjusted to her delicate waist the strap which hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>"For the last time, do you confess the facts in the case?" demanded Charmolue, with his imperturbable benignity.</p>
<p>"I am innocent."</p>
<p>"Then, mademoiselle, how do you explain the circumstance laid to your charge?"</p>
<p>"Alas, monseigneur, I do not know."</p>
<p>"So you deny them?"</p>
<p>"All!"</p>
<p>"Proceed," said Charmolue to Pierrat.</p>
<p>Pierrat turned the handle of the screw-jack, the boot was contracted, and the unhappy girl uttered one of those horrible cries which have no orthography in any human language.</p>
<p>"Stop!" said Charmolue to Pierrat. "Do you confess?" he said to the gypsy.</p>
<p>"All!" cried the wretched girl. "I confess! I confess! Mercy!"</p>
<p>She had not calculated her strength when she faced the torture. Poor child, whose life up to that time had been so joyous, so pleasant, so sweet, the first pain had conquered her!</p>
<p>"Humanity forces me to tell you," remarked the king's procurator, "that in confessing, it is death that you must expect."</p>
<p>"I certainly hope so!" said she. And she fell back upon the leather bed, dying, doubled up, allowing herself to hang suspended from the strap buckled round her waist.</p>
<p>"Come, fair one, hold up a little," said Master Pierrat, raising her. "You have the air of the lamb of the Golden Fleece which hangs from Monsieur de Bourgogne's neck."</p>
<p>Jacques Charmolue raised his voice,</p>
<p>"Clerk, write. Young Bohemian maid, you confess your participation in the feasts, witches' sabbaths, and witchcrafts of hell, with ghosts, hags, and vampires? Answer."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, so low that her words were lost in her breathing.</p>
<p>"You confess to having seen the ram which Beelzebub causes to appear in the clouds to call together the witches' sabbath, and which is beheld by socerers alone?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You confess to having adored the heads of Bophomet, those abominable idols of the Templars?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"To having had habitual dealings with the devil under the form of a goat familiar, joined with you in the suit?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Lastly, you avow and confess to having, with the aid of the demon, and of the phantom vulgarly known as the surly monk, on the night of the twenty-ninth of March last, murdered and assassinated a captain named Phoebus de Ch&#226;teaupers?"</p>
<p>She raised her large, staring eyes to the magistrate, and replied, as though mechanically, without convulsion or agitation,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>It was evident that everything within her was broken.</p>
<p>"Write, clerk," said Charmolue. And, addressing the torturers, "Release the prisoner, and take her back to the court."</p>
<p>When the prisoner had been "unbooted," the procurator of the ecclesiastical court examined her foot, which was still swollen with pain. "Come," said he, "there's no great harm done. You shrieked in good season. You could still dance, my beauty!"</p>
<p>Then he turned to his acolytes of the officiality,&#8212;"Behold justice enlightened at last! This is a solace, gentlemen! Madamoiselle will bear us witness that we have acted with all possible gentleness."</p>
