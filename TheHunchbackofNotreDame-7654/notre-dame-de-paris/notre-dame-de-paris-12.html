</div>
<p>"Hum," said the archdeacon; "those are names as fit for a good work as a catapult for the chief altar."</p>
<p>It is certain that Jehan had made a very bad choice of names for his two friends. He realized it too late.</p>
<p>"And then," pursued the sagacious Claude, "what sort of an infant's outfit is it that is to cost three forms, and that for the child of a Haudriette? Since when have the Haudriette widows taken to having babes in swaddling-clothes?"</p>
<p>Jehan broke the ice once more.</p>
<p>"Eh, well! yes! I need money in order to go and see Isabeau la Thierrye to-night; in the Val-d' Amour!"</p>
<p>"Impure wretch!" exclaimed the priest.</p>
<p>"<i>Avayveia</i>!" said Jehan.</p>
<p>This quotation, which the scholar borrowed with malice, perchance, from the wall of the cell, produced a singular effect on the archdeacon. He bit his lips and his wrath was drowned in a crimson flush.</p>
<p>"Begone," he said to Jehan. "I am expecting some one."</p>
<p>The scholar made one more effort.</p>
<p>"Brother Claude, give me at least one little parisis to buy something to eat."</p>
<p>"How far have you gone in the Decretals of Gratian?" demanded Dom Claude.</p>
<p>"I have lost my copy books.</p>
<p>"Where are you in your Latin humanities?"</p>
<p>"My copy of Horace has been stolen."</p>
<p>"Where are you in Aristotle?"</p>
<p>"I' faith! brother what father of the church is it, who says that the errors of heretics have always had for their lurking place the thickets of Aristotle's metaphysics? A plague on Aristotle! I care not to tear my religion on his metaphysics."</p>
<p>"Young man," resumed the archdeacon, "at the king's last entry, there was a young gentleman, named Philippe de Comines, who wore embroidered on the housings of his horse this device, upon which I counsel you to meditate: <i>Qui non laborat, non manducet</i>."</p>
<p>The scholar remained silent for a moment, with his finger in his ear, his eyes on the ground, and a discomfited mien.</p>
<p>All at once he turned round to Claude with the agile quickness of a wagtail.</p>
<p>"So, my good brother, you refuse me a sou parisis, wherewith to buy a crust at a baker's shop?"</p>
<p>"<i>Qui non laborat, non manducet</i>."</p>
<p>At this response of the inflexible archdeacon, Jehan hid his head in his hands, like a woman sobbing, and exclaimed with an expression of despair: "<i>Orororororoi</i>."</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this, sir?" demanded Claude, surprised at this freak.</p>
<p>"What indeed!" said the scholar; and he lifted to Claude his impudent eyes into which he had just thrust his fists in order to communicate to them the redness of tears; "'tis Greek! 'tis an anapaest of AEschylus which expresses grief perfectly."</p>
<p>And here he burst into a laugh so droll and violent that it made the archdeacon smile. It was Claude's fault, in fact: why had he so spoiled that child?</p>
<p>"Oh! good Brother Claude," resumed Jehan, emboldened by this smile, "look at my worn out boots. Is there a cothurnus in the world more tragic than these boots, whose soles are hanging out their tongues?"</p>
<p>The archdeacon promptly returned to his original severity.</p>
<p>"I will send you some new boots, but no money."</p>
<p>"Only a poor little parisis, brother," continued the suppliant Jehan. "I will learn Gratian by heart, I will believe firmly in God, I will be a regular Pythagoras of science and virtue. But one little parisis, in mercy! Would you have famine bite me with its jaws which are gaping in front of me, blacker, deeper, and more noisome than a Tartarus or the nose of a monk?"</p>
<p>Dom Claude shook his wrinkled head: "<i>Qui non laborat</i>&#8212;"</p>
<p>Jehan did not allow him to finish.</p>
<p>"Well," he exclaimed, "to the devil then! Long live joy! I will live in the tavern, I will fight, I will break pots and I will go and see the wenches." And thereupon, he hurled his cap at the wall, and snapped his fingers like castanets.</p>
<p>The archdeacon surveyed him with a gloomy air.</p>
<p>"Jehan, you have no soul."</p>
<p>"In that case, according to Epicurius, I lack a something made of another something which has no name."</p>
<p>"Jehan, you must think seriously of amending your ways."</p>
<p>"Oh, come now," cried the student, gazing in turn at his brother and the alembics on the furnace, "everything is preposterous here, both ideas and bottles!"</p>
<p>"Jehan, you are on a very slippery downward road. Do you know whither you are going?"</p>
<p>"To the wine-shop," said Jehan.</p>
<p>"The wine-shop leads to the pillory."</p>
<p>"'Tis as good a lantern as any other, and perchance with that one, Diogenes would have found his man."</p>
<p>"The pillory leads to the gallows."</p>
<p>"The gallows is a balance which has a man at one end and the whole earth at the other. 'Tis fine to be the man."</p>
<p>"The gallows leads to hell."</p>
<p>"'Tis a big fire.".</p>
<p>"Jehan, Jehan, the end will be bad."</p>
<p>"The beginning will have been good."</p>
<p>At that moment, the sound of a footstep was heard on the staircase.</p>
<p>"Silence!" said the archdeacon, laying his finger on his mouth, "here is Master Jacques. Listen, Jehan," he added, in a low voice; "have a care never to speak of what you shall have seen or heard here. Hide yourself quickly under the furnace, and do not breathe."</p>
<p>The scholar concealed himself; just then a happy idea occurred to him.</p>
<p>"By the way, Brother Claude, a form for not breathing."</p>
<p>"Silence! I promise."</p>
<p>"You must give it to me."</p>
<p>"Take it, then!" said the archdeacon angrily, flinging his purse at him.</p>
<p>Jehan darted under the furnace again, and the door opened.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00046">CHAPTER V. THE TWO MEN CLOTHED IN BLACK.</h2>
<p>The personage who entered wore a black gown and a gloomy mien. The first point which struck the eye of our Jehan (who, as the reader will readily surmise, had ensconced himself in his nook in such a manner as to enable him to see and hear everything at his good pleasure) was the perfect sadness of the garments and the visage of this new-corner. There was, nevertheless, some sweetness diffused over that face, but it was the sweetness of a cat or a judge, an affected, treacherous sweetness. He was very gray and wrinkled, and not far from his sixtieth year, his eyes blinked, his eyebrows were white, his lip pendulous, and his hands large. When Jehan saw that it was only this, that is to say, no doubt a physician or a magistrate, and that this man had a nose very far from his mouth, a sign of stupidity, he nestled down in his hole, in despair at being obliged to pass an indefinite time in such an uncomfortable attitude, and in such bad company.</p>
<p>The archdeacon, in the meantime, had not even risen to receive this personage. He had made the latter a sign to seat himself on a stool near the door, and, after several moments of a silence which appeared to be a continuation of a preceding meditation, he said to him in a rather patronizing way, "Good day, Master Jacques."</p>
<p>"Greeting, master," replied the man in black.</p>
<p>There was in the two ways in which "Master Jacques" was pronounced on the one hand, and the "master" by preeminence on the other, the difference between monseigneur and monsieur, between <i>domine</i> and <i>domne</i>. It was evidently the meeting of a teacher and a disciple.</p>
<p>"Well!" resumed the archdeacon, after a fresh silence which Master Jacques took good care not to disturb, "how are you succeeding?"</p>
<p>"Alas! master," said the other, with a sad smile, "I am still seeking the stone. Plenty of ashes. But not a spark of gold."</p>
<p>Dom Claude made a gesture of impatience. "I am not talking to you of that, Master Jacques Charmolue, but of the trial of your magician. Is it not Marc Cenaine that you call him? the butler of the Court of Accounts? Does he confess his witchcraft? Have you been successful with the torture?"</p>
<p>"Alas! no," replied Master Jacques, still with his sad smile; "we have not that consolation. That man is a stone. We might have him boiled in the March&#233; aux Pourceaux, before he would say anything. Nevertheless, we are sparing nothing for the sake of getting at the truth; he is already thoroughly dislocated, we are applying all the herbs of Saint John's day; as saith the old comedian Plautus,&#8212;</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>'Advorsum stimulos, laminas, crucesque, compedesque,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nerros, catenas, carceres, numellas, pedicas, boias</i>.'<br/>
</div>
<p>Nothing answers; that man is terrible. I am at my wit's end over him."</p>
<p>"You have found nothing new in his house?"</p>
<p>"I' faith, yes," said Master Jacques, fumbling in his pouch; "this parchment. There are words in it which we cannot comprehend. The criminal advocate, Monsieur Philippe Lheulier, nevertheless, knows a little Hebrew, which he learned in that matter of the Jews of the Rue Kantersten, at Brussels."</p>
<p>So saying, Master Jacques unrolled a parchment. "Give it here," said the archdeacon. And casting his eyes upon this writing: "Pure magic, Master Jacques!" he exclaimed. "'Emen-H&#233;tan!' 'Tis the cry of the vampires when they arrive at the witches' sabbath. <i>Per ipsum, et cum ipso, et in ipso</i>! 'Tis the command which chains the devil in hell. <i>Hax, pax, max</i>! that refers to medicine. A formula against the bite of mad dogs. Master Jacques! you are procurator to the king in the Ecclesiastical Courts: this parchment is abominable."</p>
<p>"We will put the man to the torture once more. Here again," added Master Jacques, fumbling afresh in his pouch, "is something that we have found at Marc Cenaine's house."</p>
<p>It was a vessel belonging to the same family as those which covered Dom Claude's furnace.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the archdeacon, "a crucible for alchemy."</p>
<p>"I will confess to you," continued Master Jacques, with his timid and awkward smile, "that I have tried it over the furnace, but I have succeeded no better than with my own."</p>
<p>The archdeacon began an examination of the vessel. "What has he engraved on his crucible? <i>Och! och</i>! the word which expels fleas! That Marc Cenaine is an ignoramus! I verily believe that you will never make gold with this! 'Tis good to set in your bedroom in summer and that is all!"</p>
<p>"Since we are talking about errors," said the king's procurator, "I have just been studying the figures on the portal below before ascending hither; is your reverence quite sure that the opening of the work of physics is there portrayed on the side towards the H&#244;tel-Dieu, and that among the seven nude figures which stand at the feet of Notre-Dame, that which has wings on his heels is Mercurius?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the priest; "'tis Augustin Nypho who writes it, that Italian doctor who had a bearded demon who acquainted him with all things. However, we will descend, and I will explain it to you with the text before us."</p>
<p>"Thanks, master," said Charmolue, bowing to the earth. "By the way, I was on the point of forgetting. When doth it please you that I shall apprehend the little sorceress?"</p>
<p>"What sorceress?"</p>
<p>"That gypsy girl you know, who comes every day to dance on the church square, in spite of the official's prohibition! She hath a demoniac goat with horns of the devil, which reads, which writes, which knows mathematics like Picatrix, and which would suffice to hang all Bohemia. The prosecution is all ready; 'twill soon be finished, I assure you! A pretty creature, on my soul, that dancer! The handsomest black eyes! Two Egyptian carbuncles! When shall we begin?"</p>
<p>The archdeacon was excessively pale.</p>
<p>"I will tell you that hereafter," he stammered, in a voice that was barely articulate; then he resumed with an effort, "Busy yourself with Marc Cenaine."</p>
<p>"Be at ease," said Charmolue with a smile; "I'll buckle him down again for you on the leather bed when I get home. But 'tis a devil of a man; he wearies even Pierrat Torterue himself, who hath hands larger than my own. As that good Plautus saith,&#8212;</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; '<i>Nudus vinctus, centum pondo,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; es quando pendes per pedes</i>.'<br/>
</div>
<p>The torture of the wheel and axle! 'Tis the most effectual! He shall taste it!"</p>
<p>Dom Claude seemed absorbed in gloomy abstraction. He turned to Charmolue,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Master Pierrat&#8212;Master Jacques, I mean, busy yourself with Marc Cenaine."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, Dom Claude. Poor man! he will have suffered like Mummol. What an idea to go to the witches' sabbath! a butler of the Court of Accounts, who ought to know Charlemagne's text; <i>Stryga vel masea</i>!&#8212;In the matter of the little girl,&#8212;Smelarda, as they call her,&#8212;I will await your orders. Ah! as we pass through the portal, you will explain to me also the meaning of the gardener painted in relief, which one sees as one enters the church. Is it not the Sower? H&#233;! master, of what are you thinking, pray?"</p>
<p>Dom Claude, buried in his own thoughts, no longer listened to him. Charmolue, following the direction of his glance, perceived that it was fixed mechanically on the great spider's web which draped the window. At that moment, a bewildered fly which was seeking the March sun, flung itself through the net and became entangled there. On the agitation of his web, the enormous spider made an abrupt move from his central cell, then with one bound, rushed upon the fly, which he folded together with his fore antennae, while his hideous proboscis dug into the victim's bead. "Poor fly!" said the king's procurator in the ecclesiastical court; and he raised his hand to save it. The archdeacon, as though roused with a start, withheld his arm with convulsive violence.</p>
<p>"Master Jacques," he cried, "let fate take its course!" The procurator wheeled round in affright; it seemed to him that pincers of iron had clutched his arm. The priest's eye was staring, wild, flaming, and remained riveted on the horrible little group of the spider and the fly.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!" continued the priest, in a voice which seemed to proceed from the depths of his being, "behold here a symbol of all. She flies, she is joyous, she is just born; she seeks the spring, the open air, liberty: oh, yes! but let her come in contact with the fatal network, and the spider issues from it, the hideous spider! Poor dancer! poor, predestined fly! Let things take their course, Master Jacques, 'tis fate! Alas! Claude, thou art the spider! Claude, thou art the fly also! Thou wert flying towards learning, light, the sun. Thou hadst no other care than to reach the open air, the full daylight of eternal truth; but in precipitating thyself towards the dazzling window which opens upon the other world,&#8212;upon the world of brightness, intelligence, and science&#8212;blind fly! senseless, learned man! thou hast not perceived that subtle spider's web, stretched by destiny betwixt the light and thee&#8212;thou hast flung thyself headlong into it, and now thou art struggling with head broken and mangled wings between the iron antennae of fate! Master Jacques! Master Jacques! let the spider work its will!"</p>
<p>"I assure you," said Charmolue, who was gazing at him without comprehending him, "that I will not touch it. But release my arm, master, for pity's sake! You have a hand like a pair of pincers."</p>
<p>The archdeacon did not hear him. "Oh, madman!" he went on, without removing his gaze from the window. "And even couldst thou have broken through that formidable web, with thy gnat's wings, thou believest that thou couldst have reached the light? Alas! that pane of glass which is further on, that transparent obstacle, that wall of crystal, harder than brass, which separates all philosophies from the truth, how wouldst thou have overcome it? Oh, vanity of science! how many wise men come flying from afar, to dash their heads against thee! How many systems vainly fling themselves buzzing against that eternal pane!"</p>
<p>He became silent. These last ideas, which had gradually led him back from himself to science, appeared to have calmed him. Jacques Charmolue recalled him wholly to a sense of reality by addressing to him this question: "Come, now, master, when will you come to aid me in making gold? I am impatient to succeed."</p>
<p>The archdeacon shook his head, with a bitter smile. "Master Jacques read Michel Psellus' '<i>Dialogus de Energia et Operatione Daemonum</i>.' What we are doing is not wholly innocent."</p>
<p>"Speak lower, master! I have my suspicions of it," said Jacques Charmolue. "But one must practise a bit of hermetic science when one is only procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, at thirty crowns tournois a year. Only speak low."</p>
<p>At that moment the sound of jaws in the act of mastication, which proceeded from beneath the furnace, struck Charmolue's uneasy ear.</p>
<p>"What's that?" he inquired.</p>
<p>It was the scholar, who, ill at ease, and greatly bored in his hiding-place, had succeeded in discovering there a stale crust and a triangle of mouldy cheese, and had set to devouring the whole without ceremony, by way of consolation and breakfast. As he was very hungry, he made a great deal of noise, and he accented each mouthful strongly, which startled and alarmed the procurator.</p>
<p>"'Tis a cat of mine," said the archdeacon, quickly, "who is regaling herself under there with a mouse."</p>
<p>This explanation satisfied Charmolue.</p>
<p>"In fact, master," he replied, with a respectful smile, "all great philosophers have their familiar animal. You know what Servius saith: '<i>Nullus enim locus sine genio est</i>,&#8212;for there is no place that hath not its spirit.'"</p>
<p>But Dom Claude, who stood in terror of some new freak on the part of Jehan, reminded his worthy disciple that they had some figures on the fa&#231;ade to study together, and the two quitted the cell, to the accompaniment of a great "ouf!" from the scholar, who began to seriously fear that his knee would acquire the imprint of his chin.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="dlepubid00047">CHAPTER VI. THE EFFECT WHICH SEVEN OATHS IN THE OPEN AIR CAN PRODUCE.</h2>
<p>"<i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>!" exclaimed Master Jehan, creeping out from his hole, "the screech-owls have departed. Och! och! Hax! pax! max! fleas! mad dogs! the devil! I have had enough of their conversation! My head is humming like a bell tower. And mouldy cheese to boot! Come on! Let us descend, take the big brother's purse and convert all these coins into bottles!"</p>
<p>He cast a glance of tenderness and admiration into the interior of the precious pouch, readjusted his toilet, rubbed up his boots, dusted his poor half sleeves, all gray with ashes, whistled an air, indulged in a sportive pirouette, looked about to see whether there were not something more in the cell to take, gathered up here and there on the furnace some amulet in glass which might serve to bestow, in the guise of a trinket, on Isabeau la Thierrye, finally pushed open the door which his brother had left unfastened, as a last indulgence, and which he, in his turn, left open as a last piece of malice, and descended the circular staircase, skipping like a bird.</p>
<p>In the midst of the gloom of the spiral staircase, he elbowed something which drew aside with a growl; he took it for granted that it was Quasimodo, and it struck him as so droll that he descended the remainder of the staircase holding his sides with laughter. On emerging upon the Place, he laughed yet more heartily.</p>
<p>He stamped his foot when he found himself on the ground once again. "Oh!" said he, "good and honorable pavement of Paris, cursed staircase, fit to put the angels of Jacob's ladder out of breath! What was I thinking of to thrust myself into that stone gimlet which pierces the sky; all for the sake of eating bearded cheese, and looking at the bell-towers of Paris through a hole in the wall!"</p>
<p>He advanced a few paces, and caught sight of the two screech owls, that is to say, Dom Claude and Master Jacques Charmolue, absorbed in contemplation before a carving on the fa&#231;ade. He approached them on tiptoe, and heard the archdeacon say in a low tone to Charmolue: "'Twas Guillaume de Paris who caused a Job to be carved upon this stone of the hue of lapis-lazuli, gilded on the edges. Job represents the philosopher's stone, which must also be tried and martyrized in order to become perfect, as saith Raymond Lulle: <i>Sub conservatione formoe speciftoe salva anima</i>."</p>
<p>"That makes no difference to me," said Jehan, "'tis I who have the purse."</p>
<p>At that moment he heard a powerful and sonorous voice articulate behind him a formidable series of oaths. "<i>Sang Dieu! Ventre-.Dieu! B&#233;dieu! Corps de Dieu! Nombril de Belzebuth! Nom d'un pape! Come et tonnerre</i>."</p>
<p>"Upon my soul!" exclaimed Jehan, "that can only be my friend, Captain Phoebus!"</p>
<p>This name of Phoebus reached the ears of the archdeacon at the moment when he was explaining to the king's procurator the dragon which is hiding its tail in a bath, from which issue smoke and the head of a king. Dom Claude started, interrupted himself and, to the great amazement of Charmolue, turned round and beheld his brother Jehan accosting a tall officer at the door of the Gondelaurier mansion.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, Captain Phoebus de Ch&#226;teaupers. He was backed up against a corner of the house of his betrothed and swearing like a heathen.</p>
<p>"By my faith! Captain Phoebus," said Jehan, taking him by the hand, "you are cursing with admirable vigor."</p>
<p>"Horns and thunder!" replied the captain.</p>
<p>"Horns and thunder yourself!" replied the student. "Come now, fair captain, whence comes this overflow of fine words?"</p>
<p>"Pardon me, good comrade Jehan," exclaimed Phoebus, shaking his hand, "a horse going at a gallop cannot halt short. Now, I was swearing at a hard gallop. I have just been with those prudes, and when I come forth, I always find my throat full of curses, I must spit them out or strangle, <i>ventre et tonnerre</i>!"</p>
<p>"Will you come and drink?" asked the scholar.</p>
<p>This proposition calmed the captain.</p>
<p>"I'm willing, but I have no money."</p>
<p>"But I have!"</p>
<p>"Bah! let's see it!"</p>
<p>Jehan spread out the purse before the captain's eyes, with dignity and simplicity. Meanwhile, the archdeacon, who had abandoned the dumbfounded Charmolue where he stood, had approached them and halted a few paces distant, watching them without their noticing him, so deeply were they absorbed in contemplation of the purse.</p>
<p>Phoebus exclaimed: "A purse in your pocket, Jehan! 'tis the moon in a bucket of water, one sees it there but 'tis not there. There is nothing but its shadow. Pardieu! let us wager that these are pebbles!"</p>
<p>Jehan replied coldly: "Here are the pebbles wherewith I pave my fob!"</p>
<p>And without adding another word, he emptied the purse on a neighboring post, with the air of a Roman saving his country.</p>
<p>"True God!" muttered Phoebus, "targes, big-blanks, little blanks, mailles,* every two worth one of Tournay, farthings of Paris, real eagle liards! 'Tis dazzling!"</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160; An ancient copper coin, the forty-fourth part of a sou or<br/>the twelfth part of a farthing.<br/>
</div>
<p>Jehan remained dignified and immovable. Several liards had rolled into the mud; the captain in his enthusiasm stooped to pick them up. Jehan restrained him.</p>
<p>"Fye, Captain Phoebus de Ch&#226;teaupers!"</p>
<p>Phoebus counted the coins, and turning towards Jehan with solemnity, "Do you know, Jehan, that there are three and twenty sous parisis! whom have you plundered to-night, in the Street Cut-Weazand?"</p>
<p>Jehan flung back his blonde and curly head, and said, half-closing his eyes disdainfully,&#8212;</p>
<p>"We have a brother who is an archdeacon and a fool."</p>
<p>"<i>Corne de Dieu</i>!" exclaimed Phoebus, "the worthy man!"</p>
<p>"Let us go and drink," said Jehan.</p>
<p>"Where shall we go?" said Phoebus; "'To Eve's Apple.'"</p>
<p>"No, captain, to 'Ancient Science.' An old woman sawing a basket handle*; 'tis a rebus, and I like that."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; * <i>Une vielle qui scie une anse</i>.<br/>
</div>
<p>"A plague on rebuses, Jehan! the wine is better at 'Eve's Apple'; and then, beside the door there is a vine in the sun which cheers me while I am drinking."</p>
<p>"Well! here goes for Eve and her apple," said the student, and taking Phoebus's arm. "By the way, my dear captain, you just mentioned the Rue Coupe-Gueule* That is a very bad form of speech; people are no longer so barbarous. They say, Coupe-Gorge**."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160; Cut-Weazand Street.<br/><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ** Cut-Throat Street.<br/>
</div>
<p>The two friends set out towards "Eve's Apple." It is unnecessary to mention that they had first gathered up the money, and that the archdeacon followed them.</p>
<p>The archdeacon followed them, gloomy and haggard. Was this the Phoebus whose accursed name had been mingled with all his thoughts ever since his interview with Gringoire? He did not know it, but it was at least a Phoebus, and that magic name sufficed to make the archdeacon follow the two heedless comrades with the stealthy tread of a wolf, listening to their words and observing their slightest gestures with anxious attention. Moreover, nothing was easier than to hear everything they said, as they talked loudly, not in the least concerned that the passers-by were taken into their confidence. They talked of duels, wenches, wine pots, and folly.</p>
<p>At the turning of a street, the sound of a tambourine reached them from a neighboring square. Dom Claude heard the officer say to the scholar,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Thunder! Let us hasten our steps!"</p>
<p>"Why, Phoebus?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid lest the Bohemian should see me."</p>
<p>"What Bohemian?"</p>
<p>"The little girl with the goat."</p>
<p>"La Smeralda?"</p>
<p>"That's it, Jehan. I always forget her devil of a name. Let us make haste, she will recognize me. I don't want to have that girl accost me in the street."</p>
<p>"Do you know her, Phoebus?"</p>
<p>Here the archdeacon saw Phoebus sneer, bend down to Jehan's ear, and say a few words to him in a low voice; then Phoebus burst into a laugh, and shook his head with a triumphant air.</p>
<p>"Truly?" said Jehan.</p>
<p>"Upon my soul!" said Phoebus.</p>
<p>"This evening?"</p>
<p>"This evening."</p>
<p>"Are you sure that she will come?"</p>
<p>"Are you a fool, Jehan? Does one doubt such things?"</p>
<p>"Captain Phoebus, you are a happy gendarme!"</p>
<p>The archdeacon heard the whole of this conversation. His teeth chattered; a visible shiver ran through his whole body. He halted for a moment, leaned against a post like a drunken man, then followed the two merry knaves.</p>
<p>At the moment when he overtook them once more, they had changed their conversation. He heard them singing at the top of their lungs the ancient refrain,&#8212;</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Les enfants des Petits-Carreaux<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Se font pendre cornme des veaux</i>*.<br/>

<h2 id="dlepubid00048">CHAPTER VII. THE MYSTERIOUS MONK.</h2>
<p>The illustrious wine shop of "Eve's Apple" was situated in the University, at the corner of the Rue de la Rondelle and the Rue de la B&#226;tonnier. It was a very spacious and very low hail on the ground floor, with a vaulted ceiling whose central spring rested upon a huge pillar of wood painted yellow; tables everywhere, shining pewter jugs hanging on the walls, always a large number of drinkers, a plenty of wenches, a window on the street, a vine at the door, and over the door a flaring piece of sheet-iron, painted with an apple and a woman, rusted by the rain and turning with the wind on an iron pin. This species of weather-vane which looked upon the pavement was the signboard.</p>
<p>Night was falling; the square was dark; the wine-shop, full of candles, flamed afar like a forge in the gloom; the noise of glasses and feasting, of oaths and quarrels, which escaped through the broken panes, was audible. Through the mist which the warmth of the room spread over the window in front, a hundred confused figures could be seen swarming, and from time to time a burst of noisy laughter broke forth from it. The passers-by who were going about their business, slipped past this tumultuous window without glancing at it. Only at intervals did some little ragged boy raise himself on tiptoe as far as the ledge, and hurl into the drinking-shop, that ancient, jeering hoot, with which drunken men were then pursued: "Aux Houls, saouls, saouls, saouls!"</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one man paced imperturbably back and forth in front of the tavern, gazing at it incessantly, and going no further from it than a pikernan from his sentry-box. He was enveloped in a mantle to his very nose. This mantle he had just purchased of the old-clothes man, in the vicinity of the "Eve's Apple," no doubt to protect himself from the cold of the March evening, possibly also, to conceal his costume. From time to time he paused in front of the dim window with its leaden lattice, listened, looked, and stamped his foot.</p>
<p>At length the door of the dram-shop opened. This was what he appeared to be waiting for. Two boon companions came forth. The ray of light which escaped from the door crimsoned for a moment their jovial faces.</p>
<p>The man in the mantle went and stationed himself on the watch under a porch on the other side of the street.</p>
<p>"<i>Corne et tonnerre</i>!" said one of the comrades. "Seven o'clock is on the point of striking. 'Tis the hour of my appointed meeting."</p>
<p>"I tell you," repeated his companion, with a thick tongue, "that I don't live in the Rue des Mauvaises Paroles, <i>indignus qui inter mala verba habitat</i>. I have a lodging in the Rue Jean-Pain-Mollet, <i>in vico Johannis Pain-Mollet</i>. You are more horned than a unicorn if you assert the contrary. Every one knows that he who once mounts astride a bear is never after afraid; but you have a nose turned to dainties like Saint-Jacques of the hospital."</p>
<p>"Jehan, my friend, you are drunk," said the other.</p>
<p>The other replied staggering, "It pleases you to say so, Phoebus; but it hath been proved that Plato had the profile of a hound."</p>
<p>The reader has, no doubt, already recognized our two brave friends, the captain and the scholar. It appears that the man who was lying in wait for them had also recognized them, for he slowly followed all the zigzags that the scholar caused the captain to make, who being a more hardened drinker had retained all his self-possession. By listening to them attentively, the man in the mantle could catch in its entirety the following interesting conversation,&#8212;</p>
<p>"<i>Corbacque</i>! Do try to walk straight, master bachelor; you know that I must leave you. Here it is seven o'clock. I have an appointment with a woman."</p>
<p>"Leave me then! I see stars and lances of fire. You are like the Chateau de Dampmartin, which is bursting with laughter."</p>
<p>"By the warts of my grandmother, Jehan, you are raving with too much rabidness. By the way, Jehan, have you any money left?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur Rector, there is no mistake; the little butcher's shop, <i>parva boucheria</i>."</p>
<p>"Jehau! my friend Jehan! You know that I made an appointment with that little girl at the end of the Pont Saint-Michel, and I can only take her to the Falourdel's, the old crone of the bridge, and that I must pay for a chamber. The old witch with a white moustache would not trust me. Jehan! for pity's sake! Have we drunk up the whole of the cur&#233;'s purse? Have you not a single parisis left?"</p>
<p>"The consciousness of having spent the other hours well is a just and savory condiment for the table."</p>
<p>"Belly and guts! a truce to your whimsical nonsense! Tell me, Jehan of the devil! have you any money left? Give it to me, <i>b&#233;dieu</i>! or I will search you, were you as leprous as Job, and as scabby as Caesar!"</p>
<p>"Monsieur, the Rue Galiache is a street which hath at one end the Rue de la Verrerie, and at the other the Rue de la Tixeranderie."</p>
<p>"Well, yes! my good friend Jehan, my poor comrade, the Rue Galiache is good, very good. But in the name of heaven collect your wits. I must have a sou parisis, and the appointment is for seven o'clock."</p>
<p>"Silence for the rondo, and attention to the refrain,&#8212;</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "<i>Quand les rats mangeront les cas,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Le roi sera seigneur d'Arras;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Quand la mer, qui est grande et le(e<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sera a la Saint-Jean gele(e,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On verra, par-dessus la glace,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sortir ceux d'Arras de leur place</i>*."<br/>

<p>"Well, scholar of Antichrist, may you be strangled with the entrails of your mother!" exclaimed Phoebus, and he gave the drunken scholar a rough push; the latter slipped against the wall, and slid flabbily to the pavement of Philip Augustus. A remnant of fraternal pity, which never abandons the heart of a drinker, prompted Phoebus to roll Jehan with his foot upon one of those pillows of the poor, which Providence keeps in readiness at the corner of all the street posts of Paris, and which the rich blight with the name of "a rubbish-heap." The captain adjusted Jehan's head upon an inclined plane of cabbage-stumps, and on the very instant, the scholar fell to snoring in a magnificent bass. Meanwhile, all malice was not extinguished in the captain's heart. "So much the worse if the devil's cart picks you up on its passage!" he said to the poor, sleeping clerk; and he strode off.</p>
<p>The man in the mantle, who had not ceased to follow him, halted for a moment before the prostrate scholar, as though agitated by indecision; then, uttering a profound sigh, he also strode off in pursuit of the captain.</p>
<p>We, like them, will leave Jehan to slumber beneath the open sky, and will follow them also, if it pleases the reader.</p>
<p>On emerging into the Rue Saint-Andr&#233;-des-Arcs, Captain Phoebus perceived that some one was following him. On glancing sideways by chance, he perceived a sort of shadow crawling after him along the walls. He halted, it halted; he resumed his march, it resumed its march. This disturbed him not overmuch. "Ah, bah!" he said to himself, "I have not a sou."</p>
<p>He paused in front of the College d'Autun. It was at this college that he had sketched out what he called his studies, and, through a scholar's teasing habit which still lingered in him, he never passed the fa&#231;ade without inflicting on the statue of Cardinal Pierre Bertrand, sculptured to the right of the portal, the affront of which Priapus complains so bitterly in the satire of Horace, <i>Olim truncus eram ficulnus</i>. He had done this with so much unrelenting animosity that the inscription, <i>Eduensis episcopus</i>, had become almost effaced. Therefore, he halted before the statue according to his wont. The street was utterly deserted. At the moment when he was coolly retying his shoulder knots, with his nose in the air, he saw the shadow approaching him with slow steps, so slow that he had ample time to observe that this shadow wore a cloak and a hat. On arriving near him, it halted and remained more motionless than the statue of Cardinal Bertrand. Meanwhile, it riveted upon Phoebus two intent eyes, full of that vague light which issues in the night time from the pupils of a cat.</p>
<p>The captain was brave, and would have cared very little for a highwayman, with a rapier in his hand. But this walking statue, this petrified man, froze his blood. There were then in circulation, strange stories of a surly monk, a nocturnal prowler about the streets of Paris, and they recurred confusedly to his memory. He remained for several minutes in stupefaction, and finally broke the silence with a forced laugh.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, if you are a robber, as I hope you are, you produce upon me the effect of a heron attacking a nutshell. I am the son of a ruined family, my dear fellow. Try your hand near by here. In the chapel of this college there is some wood of the true cross set in silver."</p>
<p>The hand of the shadow emerged from beneath its mantle and descended upon the arm of Phoebus with the grip of an eagle's talon; at the same time the shadow spoke,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Captain Phoebus de Ch&#226;teaupers!"</p>
<p>"What, the devil!" said Phoebus, "you know my name!"</p>
<p>"I know not your name alone," continued the man in the mantle, with his sepulchral voice. "You have a rendezvous this evening."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Phoebus in amazement.</p>
<p>"At seven o'clock."</p>
<p>"In a quarter of an hour."</p>
<p>"At la Falourdel's."</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"The lewd hag of the Pont Saint-Michel."</p>
<p>"Of Saint Michel the archangel, as the Pater Noster saith."</p>
<p>"Impious wretch!" muttered the spectre. "With a woman?"</p>
<p>"<i>Confiteor</i>,&#8212;I confess&#8212;."</p>
<p>"Who is called&#8212;?"</p>
<p>"La Smeralda," said Phoebus, gayly. All his heedlessness had gradually returned.</p>
<p>At this name, the shadow's grasp shook the arm of Phoebus in a fury.</p>
<p>"Captain Phoebus de Ch&#226;teaupers, thou liest!"</p>
<p>Any one who could have beheld at that moment the captain's inflamed countenance, his leap backwards, so violent that he disengaged himself from the grip which held him, the proud air with which he clapped his hand on his swordhilt, and, in the presence of this wrath the gloomy immobility of the man in the cloak,&#8212;any one who could have beheld this would have been frightened. There was in it a touch of the combat of Don Juan and the statue.</p>
<p>"Christ and Satan!" exclaimed the captain. "That is a word which rarely strikes the ear of a Ch&#226;teaupers! Thou wilt not dare repeat it."</p>
<p>"Thou liest!" said the shadow coldly.</p>
<p>The captain gnashed his teeth. Surly monk, phantom, superstitions,&#8212;he had forgotten all at that moment. He no longer beheld anything but a man, and an insult.</p>
<p>"Ah! this is well!" he stammered, in a voice stifled with rage. He drew his sword, then stammering, for anger as well as fear makes a man tremble: "Here! On the spot! Come on! Swords! Swords! Blood on the pavement!"</p>
<p>But the other never stirred. When he beheld his adversary on guard and ready to parry,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Captain Phoebus," he said, and his tone vibrated with bitterness, "you forget your appointment."</p>
<p>The rages of men like Phoebus are milk-soups, whose ebullition is calmed by a drop of cold water. This simple remark caused the sword which glittered in the captain's hand to be lowered.</p>
<p>"Captain," pursued the man, "to-morrow, the day after to-morrow, a month hence, ten years hence, you will find me ready to cut your throat; but go first to your rendezvous."</p>
<p>"In sooth," said Phoebus, as though seeking to capitulate with himself, "these are two charming things to be encountered in a rendezvous,&#8212;a sword and a wench; but I do not see why I should miss the one for the sake of the other, when I can have both."</p>
<p>He replaced his sword in its scabbard.</p>
<p>"Go to your rendezvous," said the man.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," replied Phoebus with some embarrassment, "many thanks for your courtesy. In fact, there will be ample time to-morrow for us to chop up father Adam's doublet into slashes and buttonholes. I am obliged to you for allowing me to pass one more agreeable quarter of an hour. I certainly did hope to put you in the gutter, and still arrive in time for the fair one, especially as it has a better appearance to make the women wait a little in such cases. But you strike me as having the air of a gallant man, and it is safer to defer our affair until to-morrow. So I will betake myself to my rendezvous; it is for seven o'clock, as you know." Here Phoebus scratched his ear. "Ah. <i>Corne Dieu</i>! I had forgotten! I haven't a sou to discharge the price of the garret, and the old crone will insist on being paid in advance. She distrusts me."</p>
<p>"Here is the wherewithal to pay."</p>
<p>Phoebus felt the stranger's cold hand slip into his a large piece of money. He could not refrain from taking the money and pressing the hand.</p>
<p>"<i>Vrai Dieu</i>!" he exclaimed, "you are a good fellow!"</p>
<p>"One condition," said the man. "Prove to me that I have been wrong and that you were speaking the truth. Hide me in some corner whence I can see whether this woman is really the one whose name you uttered."</p>
<p>"Oh!" replied Phoebus, "'tis all one to me. We will take, the Sainte-Marthe chamber; you can look at your ease from the kennel hard by."</p>
<p>"Come then," said the shadow.</p>
<p>"At your service," said the captain, "I know not whether you are Messer Diavolus in person; but let us be good friends for this evening; to-morrow I will repay you all my debts, both of purse and sword."</p>
<p>They set out again at a rapid pace. At the expiration of a few minutes, the sound of the river announced to them that they were on the Pont Saint-Michel, then loaded with houses.</p>
<p>"I will first show you the way," said Phoebus to his companion, "I will then go in search of the fair one who is awaiting me near the Petit-Ch&#226;telet."</p>
<p>His companion made no reply; he had not uttered a word since they had been walking side by side. Phoebus halted before a low door, and knocked roughly; a light made its appearance through the cracks of the door.</p>
<p>"Who is there?" cried a toothless voice.</p>
<p>"<i>Corps-Dieu! T&#234;te-Dieu! Ventre-Dieu</i>!" replied the captain.</p>
<p>The door opened instantly, and allowed the new-corners to see an old woman and an old lamp, both of which trembled. The old woman was bent double, clad in tatters, with a shaking head, pierced with two small eyes, and coiffed with a dish clout; wrinkled everywhere, on hands and face and neck; her lips retreated under her gums, and about her mouth she had tufts of white hairs which gave her the whiskered look of a cat.</p>
<p>The interior of the den was no less dilapitated than she; there were chalk walls, blackened beams in the ceiling, a dismantled chimney-piece, spiders' webs in all the corners, in the middle a staggering herd of tables and lame stools, a dirty child among the ashes, and at the back a staircase, or rather, a wooden ladder, which ended in a trap door in the ceiling.</p>
<p>On entering this lair, Phoebus's mysterious companion raised his mantle to his very eyes. Meanwhile, the captain, swearing like a Saracen, hastened to "make the sun shine in a crown" as saith our admirable R&#233;gnier.</p>
<p>"The Sainte-Marthe chamber," said he.</p>
<p>The old woman addressed him as monseigneur, and shut up the crown in a drawer. It was the coin which the man in the black mantle had given to Phoebus. While her back was turned, the bushy-headed and ragged little boy who was playing in the ashes, adroitly approached the drawer, abstracted the crown, and put in its place a dry leaf which he had plucked from a fagot.</p>
<p>The old crone made a sign to the two gentlemen, as she called them, to follow her, and mounted the ladder in advance of them. On arriving at the upper story, she set her lamp on a coffer, and, Phoebus, like a frequent visitor of the house, opened a door which opened on a dark hole. "Enter here, my dear fellow," he said to his companion. The man in the mantle obeyed without a word in reply, the door closed upon him; he heard Phoebus bolt it, and a moment later descend the stairs again with the aged hag. The light had disappeared.</p>
