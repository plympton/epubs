<h2 id="dlepubid00018">Chapter 17</h2>
<p>At seven o'clock the next morning Jurgis was let out to get water to wash his cell&#8212;a duty which he performed faithfully, but which most of the prisoners were accustomed to shirk, until their cells became so filthy that the guards interposed. Then he had more "duffers and dope," and afterward was allowed three hours for exercise, in a long, cement-walked court roofed with glass. Here were all the inmates of the jail crowded together. At one side of the court was a place for visitors, cut off by two heavy wire screens, a foot apart, so that nothing could be passed in to the prisoners; here Jurgis watched anxiously, but there came no one to see him.</p>
<p>Soon after he went back to his cell, a keeper opened the door to let in another prisoner. He was a dapper young fellow, with a light brown mustache and blue eyes, and a graceful figure. He nodded to Jurgis, and then, as the keeper closed the door upon him, began gazing critically about him.</p>
<p>"Well, pal," he said, as his glance encountered Jurgis again, "good morning."</p>
<p>"Good morning," said Jurgis.</p>
<p>"A rum go for Christmas, eh?" added the other.</p>
<p>Jurgis nodded.</p>
<p>The newcomer went to the bunks and inspected the blankets; he lifted up the mattress, and then dropped it with an exclamation. "My God!" he said, "that's the worst yet."</p>
<p>He glanced at Jurgis again. "Looks as if it hadn't been slept in last night. Couldn't stand it, eh?"</p>
<p>"I didn't want to sleep last night," said Jurgis.</p>
<p>"When did you come in?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday."</p>
<p>The other had another look around, and then wrinkled up his nose. "There's the devil of a stink in here," he said, suddenly. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"It's me," said Jurgis.</p>
<p>"You?"</p>
<p>"Yes, me."</p>
<p>"Didn't they make you wash?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but this don't wash."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Fertilizer."</p>
<p>"Fertilizer! The deuce! What are you?"</p>
<p>"I work in the stockyards&#8212;at least I did until the other day. It's in my clothes."</p>
<p>"That's a new one on me," said the newcomer. "I thought I'd been up against 'em all. What are you in for?"</p>
<p>"I hit my boss."</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;that's it. What did he do?"</p>
<p>"He&#8212;he treated me mean."</p>
<p>"I see. You're what's called an honest workingman!"</p>
<p>"What are you?" Jurgis asked.</p>
<p>"I?" The other laughed. "They say I'm a cracksman," he said.</p>
<p>"What's that?" asked Jurgis.</p>
<p>"Safes, and such things," answered the other.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Jurgis, wonderingly, and stated at the speaker in awe. "You mean you break into them&#8212;you&#8212;you&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Yes," laughed the other, "that's what they say."</p>
<p>He did not look to be over twenty-two or three, though, as Jurgis found afterward, he was thirty. He spoke like a man of education, like what the world calls a "gentleman."</p>
<p>"Is that what you're here for?" Jurgis inquired.</p>
<p>"No," was the answer. "I'm here for disorderly conduct. They were mad because they couldn't get any evidence.</p>
<p>"What's your name?" the young fellow continued after a pause. "My name's Duane&#8212;Jack Duane. I've more than a dozen, but that's my company one." He seated himself on the floor with his back to the wall and his legs crossed, and went on talking easily; he soon put Jurgis on a friendly footing&#8212;he was evidently a man of the world, used to getting on, and not too proud to hold conversation with a mere laboring man. He drew Jurgis out, and heard all about his life all but the one unmentionable thing; and then he told stories about his own life. He was a great one for stories, not always of the choicest. Being sent to jail had apparently not disturbed his cheerfulness; he had "done time" twice before, it seemed, and he took it all with a frolic welcome. What with women and wine and the excitement of his vocation, a man could afford to rest now and then.</p>
<p>Naturally, the aspect of prison life was changed for Jurgis by the arrival of a cell mate. He could not turn his face to the wall and sulk, he had to speak when he was spoken to; nor could he help being interested in the conversation of Duane&#8212;the first educated man with whom he had ever talked. How could he help listening with wonder while the other told of midnight ventures and perilous escapes, of feastings and orgies, of fortunes squandered in a night? The young fellow had an amused contempt for Jurgis, as a sort of working mule; he, too, had felt the world's injustice, but instead of bearing it patiently, he had struck back, and struck hard. He was striking all the time&#8212;there was war between him and society. He was a genial freebooter, living off the enemy, without fear or shame. He was not always victorious, but then defeat did not mean annihilation, and need not break his spirit.</p>
<p>Withal he was a goodhearted fellow&#8212;too much so, it appeared. His story came out, not in the first day, nor the second, but in the long hours that dragged by, in which they had nothing to do but talk and nothing to talk of but themselves. Jack Duane was from the East; he was a college-bred man&#8212;had been studying electrical engineering. Then his father had met with misfortune in business and killed himself; and there had been his mother and a younger brother and sister. Also, there was an invention of Duane's; Jurgis could not understand it clearly, but it had to do with telegraphing, and it was a very important thing&#8212;there were fortunes in it, millions upon millions of dollars. And Duane had been robbed of it by a great company, and got tangled up in lawsuits and lost all his money. Then somebody had given him a tip on a horse race, and he had tried to retrieve his fortune with another person's money, and had to run away, and all the rest had come from that. The other asked him what had led him to safe-breaking&#8212;to Jurgis a wild and appalling occupation to think about. A man he had met, his cell mate had replied&#8212;one thing leads to another. Didn't he ever wonder about his family, Jurgis asked. Sometimes, the other answered, but not often&#8212;he didn't allow it. Thinking about it would make it no better. This wasn't a world in which a man had any business with a family; sooner or later Jurgis would find that out also, and give up the fight and shift for himself.</p>
<p>Jurgis was so transparently what he pretended to be that his cell mate was as open with him as a child; it was pleasant to tell him adventures, he was so full of wonder and admiration, he was so new to the ways of the country. Duane did not even bother to keep back names and places&#8212;he told all his triumphs and his failures, his loves and his griefs. Also he introduced Jurgis to many of the other prisoners, nearly half of whom he knew by name. The crowd had already given Jurgis a name&#8212;they called him "he stinker." This was cruel, but they meant no harm by it, and he took it with a good-natured grin.</p>
<p>Our friend had caught now and then a whiff from the sewers over which he lived, but this was the first time that he had ever been splashed by their filth. This jail was a Noah's ark of the city's crime&#8212;there were murderers, "hold-up men" and burglars, embezzlers, counterfeiters and forgers, bigamists, "shoplifters," "confidence men," petty thieves and pickpockets, gamblers and procurers, brawlers, beggars, tramps and drunkards; they were black and white, old and young, Americans and natives of every nation under the sun. There were hardened criminals and innocent men too poor to give bail; old men, and boys literally not yet in their teens. They were the drainage of the great festering ulcer of society; they were hideous to look upon, sickening to talk to. All life had turned to rottenness and stench in them&#8212;love was a beastliness, joy was a snare, and God was an imprecation. They strolled here and there about the courtyard, and Jurgis listened to them. He was ignorant and they were wise; they had been everywhere and tried everything. They could tell the whole hateful story of it, set forth the inner soul of a city in which justice and honor, women's bodies and men's souls, were for sale in the marketplace, and human beings writhed and fought and fell upon each other like wolves in a pit; in which lusts were raging fires, and men were fuel, and humanity was festering and stewing and wallowing in its own corruption. Into this wild-beast tangle these men had been born without their consent, they had taken part in it because they could not help it; that they were in jail was no disgrace to them, for the game had never been fair, the dice were loaded. They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they had been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>To most of this Jurgis tried not to listen. They frightened him with their savage mockery; and all the while his heart was far away, where his loved ones were calling. Now and then in the midst of it his thoughts would take flight; and then the tears would come into his eyes&#8212;and he would be called back by the jeering laughter of his companions.</p>
<p>He spent a week in this company, and during all that time he had no word from his home. He paid one of his fifteen cents for a postal card, and his companion wrote a note to the family, telling them where he was and when he would be tried. There came no answer to it, however, and at last, the day before New Year's, Jurgis bade good-by to Jack Duane. The latter gave him his address, or rather the address of his mistress, and made Jurgis promise to look him up. "Maybe I could help you out of a hole some day," he said, and added that he was sorry to have him go. Jurgis rode in the patrol wagon back to Justice Callahan's court for trial.</p>
<p>One of the first things he made out as he entered the room was Teta Elzbieta and little Kotrina, looking pale and frightened, seated far in the rear. His heart began to pound, but he did not dare to try to signal to them, and neither did Elzbieta. He took his seat in the prisoners' pen and sat gazing at them in helpless agony. He saw that Ona was not with them, and was full of foreboding as to what that might mean. He spent half an hour brooding over this&#8212;and then suddenly he straightened up and the blood rushed into his face. A man had come in&#8212;Jurgis could not see his features for the bandages that swathed him, but he knew the burly figure. It was Connor! A trembling seized him, and his limbs bent as if for a spring. Then suddenly he felt a hand on his collar, and heard a voice behind him: "Sit down, you son of a&#8212;!"</p>
<p>He subsided, but he never took his eyes off his enemy. The fellow was still alive, which was a disappointment, in one way; and yet it was pleasant to see him, all in penitential plasters. He and the company lawyer, who was with him, came and took seats within the judge's railing; and a minute later the clerk called Jurgis' name, and the policeman jerked him to his feet and led him before the bar, gripping him tightly by the arm, lest he should spring upon the boss.</p>
<p>Jurgis listened while the man entered the witness chair, took the oath, and told his story. The wife of the prisoner had been employed in a department near him, and had been discharged for impudence to him. Half an hour later he had been violently attacked, knocked down, and almost choked to death. He had brought witnesses&#8212;</p>
<p>"They will probably not be necessary," observed the judge and he turned to Jurgis. "You admit attacking the plaintiff?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Him?" inquired Jurgis, pointing at the boss.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the judge. "I hit him, sir," said Jurgis.</p>
<p>"Say 'your Honor,'" said the officer, pinching his arm hard.</p>
<p>"Your Honor," said Jurgis, obediently.</p>
<p>"You tried to choke him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, your Honor."</p>
<p>"Ever been arrested before?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, your Honor."</p>
<p>"What have you to say for yourself?"</p>
<p>Jurgis hesitated. What had he to say? In two years and a half he had learned to speak English for practical purposes, but these had never included the statement that some one had intimidated and seduced his wife. He tried once or twice, stammering and balking, to the annoyance of the judge, who was gasping from the odor of fertilizer. Finally, the prisoner made it understood that his vocabulary was inadequate, and there stepped up a dapper young man with waxed mustaches, bidding him speak in any language he knew.</p>
<p>Jurgis began; supposing that he would be given time, he explained how the boss had taken advantage of his wife's position to make advances to her and had threatened her with the loss of her place. When the interpreter had translated this, the judge, whose calendar was crowded, and whose automobile was ordered for a certain hour, interrupted with the remark: "Oh, I see. Well, if he made love to your wife, why didn't she complain to the superintendent or leave the place?"</p>
<p>Jurgis hesitated, somewhat taken aback; he began to explain that they were very poor&#8212;that work was hard to get&#8212;</p>
<p>"I see," said Justice Callahan; "so instead you thought you would knock him down." He turned to the plaintiff, inquiring, "Is there any truth in this story, Mr. Connor?"</p>
<p>"Not a particle, your Honor," said the boss. "It is very unpleasant&#8212;they tell some such tale every time you have to discharge a woman&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," said the judge. "I hear it often enough. The fellow seems to have handled you pretty roughly. Thirty days and costs. Next case."</p>
<p>Jurgis had been listening in perplexity. It was only when the policeman who had him by the arm turned and started to lead him away that he realized that sentence had been passed. He gazed round him wildly. "Thirty days!" he panted and then he whirled upon the judge. "What will my family do?" he cried frantically. "I have a wife and baby, sir, and they have no money&#8212;my God, they will starve to death!"</p>
<p>"You would have done well to think about them before you committed the assault," said the judge dryly, as he turned to look at the next prisoner.</p>
<p>Jurgis would have spoken again, but the policeman had seized him by the collar and was twisting it, and a second policeman was making for him with evidently hostile intentions. So he let them lead him away. Far down the room he saw Elzbieta and Kotrina, risen from their seats, staring in fright; he made one effort to go to them, and then, brought back by another twist at his throat, he bowed his head and gave up the struggle. They thrust him into a cell room, where other prisoners were waiting; and as soon as court had adjourned they led him down with them into the "Black Maria," and drove him away.</p>
<p>This time Jurgis was bound for the "Bridewell," a petty jail where Cook County prisoners serve their time. It was even filthier and more crowded than the county jail; all the smaller fry out of the latter had been sifted into it&#8212;the petty thieves and swindlers, the brawlers and vagrants. For his cell mate Jurgis had an Italian fruit seller who had refused to pay his graft to the policeman, and been arrested for carrying a large pocketknife; as he did not understand a word of English our friend was glad when he left. He gave place to a Norwegian sailor, who had lost half an ear in a drunken brawl, and who proved to be quarrelsome, cursing Jurgis because he moved in his bunk and caused the roaches to drop upon the lower one. It would have been quite intolerable, staying in a cell with this wild beast, but for the fact that all day long the prisoners were put at work breaking stone.</p>
<p>Ten days of his thirty Jurgis spent thus, without hearing a word from his family; then one day a keeper came and informed him that there was a visitor to see him. Jurgis turned white, and so weak at the knees that he could hardly leave his cell.</p>
<p>The man led him down the corridor and a flight of steps to the visitors' room, which was barred like a cell. Through the grating Jurgis could see some one sitting in a chair; and as he came into the room the person started up, and he saw that it was little Stanislovas. At the sight of some one from home the big fellow nearly went to pieces&#8212;he had to steady himself by a chair, and he put his other hand to his forehead, as if to clear away a mist. "Well?" he said, weakly.</p>
<p>Little Stanislovas was also trembling, and all but too frightened to speak. "They&#8212;they sent me to tell you&#8212;" he said, with a gulp.</p>
<p>"Well?" Jurgis repeated. He followed the boy's glance to where the keeper was standing watching them. "Never mind that," Jurgis cried, wildly. "How are they?"</p>
<p>"Ona is very sick," Stanislovas said; "and we are almost starving. We can't get along; we thought you might be able to help us."</p>
<p>Jurgis gripped the chair tighter; there were beads of perspiration on his forehead, and his hand shook. "I&#8212;can't help you," he said.</p>
<p>"Ona lies in her room all day," the boy went on, breathlessly. "She won't eat anything, and she cries all the time. She won't tell what is the matter and she won't go to work at all. Then a long time ago the man came for the rent. He was very cross. He came again last week. He said he would turn us out of the house. And then Marija&#8212;"</p>
<p>A sob choked Stanislovas, and he stopped. "What's the matter with Marija?" cried Jurgis.</p>
<p>"She's cut her hand!" said the boy. "She's cut it bad, this time, worse than before. She can't work and it's all turning green, and the company doctor says she may&#8212;she may have to have it cut off. And Marija cries all the time&#8212;her money is nearly all gone, too, and we can't pay the rent and the interest on the house; and we have no coal and nothing more to eat, and the man at the store, he says&#8212;"</p>
<p>The little fellow stopped again, beginning to whimper. "Go on!" the other panted in frenzy&#8212;"Go on!"</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I will," sobbed Stanislovas. "It's so&#8212;so cold all the time. And last Sunday it snowed again&#8212;a deep, deep snow&#8212;and I couldn't&#8212;couldn't get to work."</p>
<p>"God!" Jurgis half shouted, and he took a step toward the child. There was an old hatred between them because of the snow&#8212;ever since that dreadful morning when the boy had had his fingers frozen and Jurgis had had to beat him to send him to work. Now he clenched his hands, looking as if he would try to break through the grating. "You little villain," he cried, "you didn't try!"</p>
<p>"I did&#8212;I did!" wailed Stanislovas, shrinking from him in terror. "I tried all day&#8212;two days. Elzbieta was with me, and she couldn't either. We couldn't walk at all, it was so deep. And we had nothing to eat, and oh, it was so cold! I tried, and then the third day Ona went with me&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Ona!"</p>
<p>"Yes. She tried to get to work, too. She had to. We were all starving. But she had lost her place&#8212;"</p>
<p>Jurgis reeled, and gave a gasp. "She went back to that place?" he screamed. "She tried to," said Stanislovas, gazing at him in perplexity. "Why not, Jurgis?"</p>
<p>The man breathed hard, three or four times. "Go&#8212;on," he panted, finally.</p>
<p>"I went with her," said Stanislovas, "but Miss Henderson wouldn't take her back. And Connor saw her and cursed her. He was still bandaged up&#8212;why did you hit him, Jurgis?" (There was some fascinating mystery about this, the little fellow knew; but he could get no satisfaction.)</p>
<p>Jurgis could not speak; he could only stare, his eyes starting out. "She has been trying to get other work," the boy went on; "but she's so weak she can't keep up. And my boss would not take me back, either&#8212;Ona says he knows Connor, and that's the reason; they've all got a grudge against us now. So I've got to go downtown and sell papers with the rest of the boys and Kotrina&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Kotrina!"</p>
<p>"Yes, she's been selling papers, too. She does best, because she's a girl. Only the cold is so bad&#8212;it's terrible coming home at night, Jurgis. Sometimes they can't come home at all&#8212;I'm going to try to find them tonight and sleep where they do, it's so late and it's such a long ways home. I've had to walk, and I didn't know where it was&#8212;I don't know how to get back, either. Only mother said I must come, because you would want to know, and maybe somebody would help your family when they had put you in jail so you couldn't work. And I walked all day to get here&#8212;and I only had a piece of bread for breakfast, Jurgis. Mother hasn't any work either, because the sausage department is shut down; and she goes and begs at houses with a basket, and people give her food. Only she didn't get much yesterday; it was too cold for her fingers, and today she was crying&#8212;"</p>
<p>So little Stanislovas went on, sobbing as he talked; and Jurgis stood, gripping the table tightly, saying not a word, but feeling that his head would burst; it was like having weights piled upon him, one after another, crushing the life out of him. He struggled and fought within himself&#8212;as if in some terrible nightmare, in which a man suffers an agony, and cannot lift his hand, nor cry out, but feels that he is going mad, that his brain is on fire&#8212;</p>
<p>Just when it seemed to him that another turn of the screw would kill him, little Stanislovas stopped. "You cannot help us?" he said weakly.</p>
<p>Jurgis shook his head.</p>
<p>"They won't give you anything here?"</p>
<p>He shook it again.</p>
<p>"When are you coming out?"</p>
<p>"Three weeks yet," Jurgis answered.</p>
<p>And the boy gazed around him uncertainly. "Then I might as well go," he said.</p>
<p>Jurgis nodded. Then, suddenly recollecting, he put his hand into his pocket and drew it out, shaking. "Here," he said, holding out the fourteen cents. "Take this to them."</p>
<p>And Stanislovas took it, and after a little more hesitation, started for the door. "Good-by, Jurgis," he said, and the other noticed that he walked unsteadily as he passed out of sight.</p>
<p>For a minute or so Jurgis stood clinging to his chair, reeling and swaying; then the keeper touched him on the arm, and he turned and went back to breaking stone.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00019">Chapter 18</h2>
<p>Jurgis did not get out of the Bridewell quite as soon as he had expected. To his sentence there were added "court costs" of a dollar and a half&#8212;he was supposed to pay for the trouble of putting him in jail, and not having the money, was obliged to work it off by three days more of toil. Nobody had taken the trouble to tell him this&#8212;only after counting the days and looking forward to the end in an agony of impatience, when the hour came that he expected to be free he found himself still set at the stone heap, and laughed at when he ventured to protest. Then he concluded he must have counted wrong; but as another day passed, he gave up all hope&#8212;and was sunk in the depths of despair, when one morning after breakfast a keeper came to him with the word that his time was up at last. So he doffed his prison garb, and put on his old fertilizer clothing, and heard the door of the prison clang behind him.</p>
<p>He stood upon the steps, bewildered; he could hardly believe that it was true,&#8212;that the sky was above him again and the open street before him; that he was a free man. But then the cold began to strike through his clothes, and he started quickly away.</p>
<p>There had been a heavy snow, and now a thaw had set in; fine sleety rain was falling, driven by a wind that pierced Jurgis to the bone. He had not stopped for his-overcoat when he set out to "do up" Connor, and so his rides in the patrol wagons had been cruel experiences; his clothing was old and worn thin, and it never had been very warm. Now as he trudged on the rain soon wet it through; there were six inches of watery slush on the sidewalks, so that his feet would soon have been soaked, even had there been no holes in his shoes.</p>
<p>Jurgis had had enough to eat in the jail, and the work had been the least trying of any that he had done since he came to Chicago; but even so, he had not grown strong&#8212;the fear and grief that had preyed upon his mind had worn him thin. Now he shivered and shrunk from the rain, hiding his hands in his pockets and hunching his shoulders together. The Bridewell grounds were on the outskirts of the city and the country around them was unsettled and wild&#8212;on one side was the big drainage canal, and on the other a maze of railroad tracks, and so the wind had full sweep.</p>
<p>After walking a ways, Jurgis met a little ragamuffin whom he hailed: "Hey, sonny!" The boy cocked one eye at him&#8212;he knew that Jurgis was a "jailbird" by his shaven head. "Wot yer want?" he queried.</p>
<p>"How do you go to the stockyards?" Jurgis demanded.</p>
<p>"I don't go," replied the boy.</p>
<p>Jurgis hesitated a moment, nonplussed. Then he said, "I mean which is the way?"</p>
<p>"Why don't yer say so then?" was the response, and the boy pointed to the northwest, across the tracks. "That way."</p>
<p>"How far is it?" Jurgis asked. "I dunno," said the other. "Mebbe twenty miles or so."</p>
<p>"Twenty miles!" Jurgis echoed, and his face fell. He had to walk every foot of it, for they had turned him out of jail without a penny in his pockets.</p>
<p>Yet, when he once got started, and his blood had warmed with walking, he forgot everything in the fever of his thoughts. All the dreadful imaginations that had haunted him in his cell now rushed into his mind at once. The agony was almost over&#8212;he was going to find out; and he clenched his hands in his pockets as he strode, following his flying desire, almost at a run. Ona&#8212;the baby&#8212;the family&#8212;the house&#8212;he would know the truth about them all! And he was coming to the rescue&#8212;he was free again! His hands were his own, and he could help them, he could do battle for them against the world.</p>
<p>For an hour or so he walked thus, and then he began to look about him. He seemed to be leaving the city altogether. The street was turning into a country road, leading out to the westward; there were snow-covered fields on either side of him. Soon he met a farmer driving a two-horse wagon loaded with straw, and he stopped him.</p>
<p>"Is this the way to the stockyards?" he asked.</p>
<p>The farmer scratched his head. "I dunno jest where they be," he said. "But they're in the city somewhere, and you're going dead away from it now."</p>
<p>Jurgis looked dazed. "I was told this was the way," he said.</p>
<p>"Who told you?"</p>
<p>"A boy."</p>
<p>"Well, mebbe he was playing a joke on ye. The best thing ye kin do is to go back, and when ye git into town ask a policeman. I'd take ye in, only I've come a long ways an' I'm loaded heavy. Git up!"</p>
<p>So Jurgis turned and followed, and toward the end of the morning he began to see Chicago again. Past endless blocks of two-story shanties he walked, along wooden sidewalks and unpaved pathways treacherous with deep slush holes. Every few blocks there would be a railroad crossing on the level with the sidewalk, a deathtrap for the unwary; long freight trains would be passing, the cars clanking and crashing together, and Jurgis would pace about waiting, burning up with a fever of impatience. Occasionally the cars would stop for some minutes, and wagons and streetcars would crowd together waiting, the drivers swearing at each other, or hiding beneath umbrellas out of the rain; at such times Jurgis would dodge under the gates and run across the tracks and between the cars, taking his life into his hands.</p>
<p>He crossed a long bridge over a river frozen solid and covered with slush. Not even on the river bank was the snow white&#8212;the rain which fell was a diluted solution of smoke, and Jurgis' hands and face were streaked with black. Then he came into the business part of the city, where the streets were sewers of inky blackness, with horses sleeping and plunging, and women and children flying across in panic-stricken droves. These streets were huge canyons formed by towering black buildings, echoing with the clang of car gongs and the shouts of drivers; the people who swarmed in them were as busy as ants&#8212;all hurrying breathlessly, never stopping to look at anything nor at each other. The solitary trampish-looking foreigner, with water-soaked clothing and haggard face and anxious eyes, was as much alone as he hurried past them, as much unheeded and as lost, as if he had been a thousand miles deep in a wilderness.</p>
<p>A policeman gave him his direction and told him that he had five miles to go. He came again to the slum districts, to avenues of saloons and cheap stores, with long dingy red factory buildings, and coal-yards and railroad tracks; and then Jurgis lifted up his head and began to sniff the air like a startled animal&#8212;scenting the far-off odor of home. It was late afternoon then, and he was hungry, but the dinner invitations hung out of the saloons were not for him.</p>
<p>So he came at last to the stockyards, to the black volcanoes of smoke and the lowing cattle and the stench. Then, seeing a crowded car, his impatience got the better of him and he jumped aboard, hiding behind another man, unnoticed by the conductor. In ten minutes more he had reached his street, and home.</p>
<p>He was half running as he came round the corner. There was the house, at any rate&#8212;and then suddenly he stopped and stared. What was the matter with the house?</p>
<p>Jurgis looked twice, bewildered; then he glanced at the house next door and at the one beyond&#8212;then at the saloon on the corner. Yes, it was the right place, quite certainly&#8212;he had not made any mistake. But the house&#8212;the house was a different color!</p>
<p>He came a couple of steps nearer. Yes; it had been gray and now it was yellow! The trimmings around the windows had been red, and now they were green! It was all newly painted! How strange it made it seem!</p>
<p>Jurgis went closer yet, but keeping on the other side of the street. A sudden and horrible spasm of fear had come over him. His knees were shaking beneath him, and his mind was in a whirl. New paint on the house, and new weatherboards, where the old had begun to rot off, and the agent had got after them! New shingles over the hole in the roof, too, the hole that had for six months been the bane of his soul&#8212;he having no money to have it fixed and no time to fix it himself, and the rain leaking in, and overflowing the pots and pans he put to catch it, and flooding the attic and loosening the plaster. And now it was fixed! And the broken windowpane replaced! And curtains in the windows! New, white curtains, stiff and shiny!</p>
<p>Then suddenly the front door opened. Jurgis stood, his chest heaving as he struggled to catch his breath. A boy had come out, a stranger to him; a big, fat, rosy-cheeked youngster, such as had never been seen in his home before.</p>
<p>Jurgis stared at the boy, fascinated. He came down the steps whistling, kicking off the snow. He stopped at the foot, and picked up some, and then leaned against the railing, making a snowball. A moment later he looked around and saw Jurgis, and their eyes met; it was a hostile glance, the boy evidently thinking that the other had suspicions of the snowball. When Jurgis started slowly across the street toward him, he gave a quick glance about, meditating retreat, but then he concluded to stand his ground.</p>
<p>Jurgis took hold of the railing of the steps, for he was a little unsteady. "What&#8212;what are you doing here?" he managed to gasp.</p>
<p>"Go on!" said the boy.</p>
<p>"You&#8212;" Jurgis tried again. "What do you want here?"</p>
<p>"Me?" answered the boy, angrily. "I live here."</p>
<p>"You live here!" Jurgis panted. He turned white and clung more tightly to the railing. "You live here! Then where's my family?"</p>
<p>The boy looked surprised. "Your family!" he echoed.</p>
<p>And Jurgis started toward him. "I&#8212;this is my house!" he cried.</p>
<p>"Come off!" said the boy; then suddenly the door upstairs opened, and he called: "Hey, ma! Here's a fellow says he owns this house."</p>
<p>A stout Irishwoman came to the top of the steps. "What's that?" she demanded.</p>
<p>Jurgis turned toward her. "Where is my family?" he cried, wildly. "I left them here! This is my home! What are you doing in my home?"</p>
<p>The woman stared at him in frightened wonder, she must have thought she was dealing with a maniac&#8212;Jurgis looked like one. "Your home!" she echoed.</p>
<p>"My home!" he half shrieked. "I lived here, I tell you."</p>
<p>"You must be mistaken," she answered him. "No one ever lived here. This is a new house. They told us so. They&#8212;"</p>
<p>"What have they done with my family?" shouted Jurgis, frantically.</p>
<p>A light had begun to break upon the woman; perhaps she had had doubts of what "they" had told her. "I don't know where your family is," she said. "I bought the house only three days ago, and there was nobody here, and they told me it was all new. Do you really mean you had ever rented it?"</p>
<p>"Rented it!" panted Jurgis. "I bought it! I paid for it! I own it! And they&#8212;my God, can't you tell me where my people went?"</p>
<p>She made him understand at last that she knew nothing. Jurgis' brain was so confused that he could not grasp the situation. It was as if his family had been wiped out of existence; as if they were proving to be dream people, who never had existed at all. He was quite lost&#8212;but then suddenly he thought of Grandmother Majauszkiene, who lived in the next block. She would know! He turned and started at a run.</p>
<p>Grandmother Majauszkiene came to the door herself. She cried out when she saw Jurgis, wild-eyed and shaking. Yes, yes, she could tell him. The family had moved; they had not been able to pay the rent and they had been turned out into the snow, and the house had been repainted and sold again the next week. No, she had not heard how they were, but she could tell him that they had gone back to Aniele Jukniene, with whom they had stayed when they first came to the yards. Wouldn't Jurgis come in and rest? It was certainly too bad&#8212;if only he had not got into jail&#8212;</p>
<p>And so Jurgis turned and staggered away. He did not go very far round the corner he gave out completely, and sat down on the steps of a saloon, and hid his face in his hands, and shook all over with dry, racking sobs.</p>
<p>Their home! Their home! They had lost it! Grief, despair, rage, overwhelmed him&#8212;what was any imagination of the thing to this heartbreaking, crushing reality of it&#8212;to the sight of strange people living in his house, hanging their curtains to his windows, staring at him with hostile eyes! It was monstrous, it was unthinkable&#8212;they could not do it&#8212;it could not be true! Only think what he had suffered for that house&#8212;what miseries they had all suffered for it&#8212;the price they had paid for it!</p>
<p>The whole long agony came back to him. Their sacrifices in the beginning, their three hundred dollars that they had scraped together, all they owned in the world, all that stood between them and starvation! And then their toil, month by month, to get together the twelve dollars, and the interest as well, and now and then the taxes, and the other charges, and the repairs, and what not! Why, they had put their very souls into their payments on that house, they had paid for it with their sweat and tears&#8212;yes, more, with their very lifeblood. Dede Antanas had died of the struggle to earn that money&#8212;he would have been alive and strong today if he had not had to work in Durham's dark cellars to earn his share. And Ona, too, had given her health and strength to pay for it&#8212;she was wrecked and ruined because of it; and so was he, who had been a big, strong man three years ago, and now sat here shivering, broken, cowed, weeping like a hysterical child. Ah! they had cast their all into the fight; and they had lost, they had lost! All that they had paid was gone&#8212;every cent of it. And their house was gone&#8212;they were back where they had started from, flung out into the cold to starve and freeze!</p>
<p>Jurgis could see all the truth now&#8212;could see himself, through the whole long course of events, the victim of ravenous vultures that had torn into his vitals and devoured him; of fiends that had racked and tortured him, mocking him, meantime, jeering in his face. Ah, God, the horror of it, the monstrous, hideous, demoniacal wickedness of it! He and his family, helpless women and children, struggling to live, ignorant and defenseless and forlorn as they were&#8212;and the enemies that had been lurking for them, crouching upon their trail and thirsting for their blood! That first lying circular, that smooth-tongued slippery agent! That trap of the extra payments, the interest, and all the other charges that they had not the means to pay, and would never have attempted to pay! And then all the tricks of the packers, their masters, the tyrants who ruled them&#8212;the shutdowns and the scarcity of work, the irregular hours and the cruel speeding-up, the lowering of wages, the raising of prices! The mercilessness of nature about them, of heat and cold, rain and snow; the mercilessness of the city, of the country in which they lived, of its laws and customs that they did not understand! All of these things had worked together for the company that had marked them for its prey and was waiting for its chance. And now, with this last hideous injustice, its time had come, and it had turned them out bag and baggage, and taken their house and sold it again! And they could do nothing, they were tied hand and foot&#8212;the law was against them, the whole machinery of society was at their oppressors' command! If Jurgis so much as raised a hand against them, back he would go into that wild-beast pen from which he had just escaped!</p>
<p>To get up and go away was to give up, to acknowledge defeat, to leave the strange family in possession; and Jurgis might have sat shivering in the rain for hours before he could do that, had it not been for the thought of his family. It might be that he had worse things yet to learn&#8212;and so he got to his feet and started away, walking on, wearily, half-dazed.</p>
<p>To Aniele's house, in back of the yards, was a good two miles; the distance had never seemed longer to Jurgis, and when he saw the familiar dingy-gray shanty his heart was beating fast. He ran up the steps and began to hammer upon the door.</p>
<p>The old woman herself came to open it. She had shrunk all up with her rheumatism since Jurgis had seen her last, and her yellow parchment face stared up at him from a little above the level of the doorknob. She gave a start when she saw him. "Is Ona here?" he cried, breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Yes," was the answer, "she's here."</p>
<p>"How&#8212;" Jurgis began, and then stopped short, clutching convulsively at the side of the door. From somewhere within the house had come a sudden cry, a wild, horrible scream of anguish. And the voice was Ona's. For a moment Jurgis stood half-paralyzed with fright; then he bounded past the old woman and into the room.</p>
<p>It was Aniele's kitchen, and huddled round the stove were half a dozen women, pale and frightened. One of them started to her feet as Jurgis entered; she was haggard and frightfully thin, with one arm tied up in bandages&#8212;he hardly realized that it was Marija. He looked first for Ona; then, not seeing her, he stared at the women, expecting them to speak. But they sat dumb, gazing back at him, panic-stricken; and a second later came another piercing scream.</p>
<p>It was from the rear of the house, and upstairs. Jurgis bounded to a door of the room and flung it open; there was a ladder leading through a trap door to the garret, and he was at the foot of it when suddenly he heard a voice behind him, and saw Marija at his heels. She seized him by the sleeve with her good hand, panting wildly, "No, no, Jurgis! Stop!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" he gasped.</p>
<p>"You mustn't go up," she cried.</p>
<p>Jurgis was half-crazed with bewilderment and fright. "What's the matter?" he shouted. "What is it?"</p>
<p>Marija clung to him tightly; he could hear Ona sobbing and moaning above, and he fought to get away and climb up, without waiting for her reply. "No, no," she rushed on. "Jurgis! You mustn't go up! It's&#8212;it's the child!"</p>
<p>"The child?" he echoed in perplexity. "Antanas?"</p>
<p>Marija answered him, in a whisper: "The new one!"</p>
<p>And then Jurgis went limp, and caught himself on the ladder. He stared at her as if she were a ghost. "The new one!" he gasped. "But it isn't time," he added, wildly.</p>
<p>Marija nodded. "I know," she said; "but it's come."</p>
<p>And then again came Ona's scream, smiting him like a blow in the face, making him wince and turn white. Her voice died away into a wail&#8212;then he heard her sobbing again, "My God&#8212;let me die, let me die!" And Marija hung her arms about him, crying: "Come out! Come away!"</p>
<p>She dragged him back into the kitchen, half carrying him, for he had gone all to pieces. It was as if the pillars of his soul had fallen in&#8212;he was blasted with horror. In the room he sank into a chair, trembling like a leaf, Marija still holding him, and the women staring at him in dumb, helpless fright.</p>
<p>And then again Ona cried out; he could hear it nearly as plainly here, and he staggered to his feet. "How long has this been going on?" he panted.</p>
<p>"Not very long," Marija answered, and then, at a signal from Aniele, she rushed on: "You go away, Jurgis you can't help&#8212;go away and come back later. It's all right&#8212;it's&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Who's with her?" Jurgis demanded; and then, seeing Marija hesitating, he cried again, "Who's with her?"</p>
<p>"She's&#8212;she's all right," she answered. "Elzbieta's with her."</p>
<p>"But the doctor!" he panted. "Some one who knows!"</p>
<p>He seized Marija by the arm; she trembled, and her voice sank beneath a whisper as she replied, "We&#8212;we have no money." Then, frightened at the look on his face, she exclaimed: "It's all right, Jurgis! You don't understand&#8212;go away&#8212;go away! Ah, if you only had waited!"</p>
<p>Above her protests Jurgis heard Ona again; he was almost out of his mind. It was all new to him, raw and horrible&#8212;it had fallen upon him like a lightning stroke. When little Antanas was born he had been at work, and had known nothing about it until it was over; and now he was not to be controlled. The frightened women were at their wits' end; one after another they tried to reason with him, to make him understand that this was the lot of woman. In the end they half drove him out into the rain, where he began to pace up and down, bareheaded and frantic. Because he could hear Ona from the street, he would first go away to escape the sounds, and then come back because he could not help it. At the end of a quarter of an hour he rushed up the steps again, and for fear that he would break in the door they had to open it and let him in.</p>
<p>There was no arguing with him. They could not tell him that all was going well&#8212;how could they know, he cried&#8212;why, she was dying, she was being torn to pieces! Listen to her&#8212;listen! Why, it was monstrous&#8212;it could not be allowed&#8212;there must be some help for it! Had they tried to get a doctor? They might pay him afterward&#8212;they could promise&#8212;</p>
<p>"We couldn't promise, Jurgis," protested Marija. "We had no money&#8212;we have scarcely been able to keep alive."</p>
<p>"But I can work," Jurgis exclaimed. "I can earn money!"</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered&#8212;"but we thought you were in jail. How could we know when you would return? They will not work for nothing."</p>
<p>Marija went on to tell how she had tried to find a midwife, and how they had demanded ten, fifteen, even twenty-five dollars, and that in cash. "And I had only a quarter," she said. "I have spent every cent of my money&#8212;all that I had in the bank; and I owe the doctor who has been coming to see me, and he has stopped because he thinks I don't mean to pay him. And we owe Aniele for two weeks' rent, and she is nearly starving, and is afraid of being turned out. We have been borrowing and begging to keep alive, and there is nothing more we can do&#8212;"</p>
<p>"And the children?" cried Jurgis.</p>
<p>"The children have not been home for three days, the weather has been so bad. They could not know what is happening&#8212;it came suddenly, two months before we expected it."</p>
<p>Jurgis was standing by the table, and he caught himself with his hand; his head sank and his arms shook&#8212;it looked as if he were going to collapse. Then suddenly Aniele got up and came hobbling toward him, fumbling in her skirt pocket. She drew out a dirty rag, in one corner of which she had something tied.</p>
<p>"Here, Jurgis!" she said, "I have some money. Palauk! See!"</p>
<p>She unwrapped it and counted it out&#8212;thirty-four cents. "You go, now," she said, "and try and get somebody yourself. And maybe the rest can help&#8212;give him some money, you; he will pay you back some day, and it will do him good to have something to think about, even if he doesn't succeed. When he comes back, maybe it will be over."</p>
<p>And so the other women turned out the contents of their pocketbooks; most of them had only pennies and nickels, but they gave him all. Mrs. Olszewski, who lived next door, and had a husband who was a skilled cattle butcher, but a drinking man, gave nearly half a dollar, enough to raise the whole sum to a dollar and a quarter. Then Jurgis thrust it into his pocket, still holding it tightly in his fist, and started away at a run.</p>
