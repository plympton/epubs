<h2 id="dlepubid00016">Chapter 15</h2>
<p>The beginning of these perplexing things was in the summer; and each time Ona would promise him with terror in her voice that it would not happen again&#8212;but in vain. Each crisis would leave Jurgis more and more frightened, more disposed to distrust Elzbieta's consolations, and to believe that there was some terrible thing about all this that he was not allowed to know. Once or twice in these outbreaks he caught Ona's eye, and it seemed to him like the eye of a hunted animal; there were broken phrases of anguish and despair now and then, amid her frantic weeping. It was only because he was so numb and beaten himself that Jurgis did not worry more about this. But he never thought of it, except when he was dragged to it&#8212;he lived like a dumb beast of burden, knowing only the moment in which he was.</p>
<p>The winter was coming on again, more menacing and cruel than ever. It was October, and the holiday rush had begun. It was necessary for the packing machines to grind till late at night to provide food that would be eaten at Christmas breakfasts; and Marija and Elzbieta and Ona, as part of the machine, began working fifteen or sixteen hours a day. There was no choice about this&#8212;whatever work there was to be done they had to do, if they wished to keep their places; besides that, it added another pittance to their incomes. So they staggered on with the awful load. They would start work every morning at seven, and eat their dinners at noon, and then work until ten or eleven at night without another mouthful of food. Jurgis wanted to wait for them, to help them home at night, but they would not think of this; the fertilizer mill was not running overtime, and there was no place for him to wait save in a saloon. Each would stagger out into the darkness, and make her way to the corner, where they met; or if the others had already gone, would get into a car, and begin a painful struggle to keep awake. When they got home they were always too tired either to eat or to undress; they would crawl into bed with their shoes on, and lie like logs. If they should fail, they would certainly be lost; if they held out, they might have enough coal for the winter.</p>
<p>A day or two before Thanksgiving Day there came a snowstorm. It began in the afternoon, and by evening two inches had fallen. Jurgis tried to wait for the women, but went into a saloon to get warm, and took two drinks, and came out and ran home to escape from the demon; there he lay down to wait for them, and instantly fell asleep. When he opened his eyes again he was in the midst of a nightmare, and found Elzbieta shaking him and crying out. At first he could not realize what she was saying&#8212;Ona had not come home. What time was it, he asked. It was morning&#8212;time to be up. Ona had not been home that night! And it was bitter cold, and a foot of snow on the ground.</p>
<p>Jurgis sat up with a start. Marija was crying with fright and the children were wailing in sympathy&#8212;little Stanislovas in addition, because the terror of the snow was upon him. Jurgis had nothing to put on but his shoes and his coat, and in half a minute he was out of the door. Then, however, he realized that there was no need of haste, that he had no idea where to go. It was still dark as midnight, and the thick snowflakes were sifting down&#8212;everything was so silent that he could hear the rustle of them as they fell. In the few seconds that he stood there hesitating he was covered white.</p>
<p>He set off at a run for the yards, stopping by the way to inquire in the saloons that were open. Ona might have been overcome on the way; or else she might have met with an accident in the machines. When he got to the place where she worked he inquired of one of the watchmen&#8212;there had not been any accident, so far as the man had heard. At the time office, which he found already open, the clerk told him that Ona's check had been turned in the night before, showing that she had left her work.</p>
<p>After that there was nothing for him to do but wait, pacing back and forth in the snow, meantime, to keep from freezing. Already the yards were full of activity; cattle were being unloaded from the cars in the distance, and across the way the "beef-luggers" were toiling in the darkness, carrying two-hundred-pound quarters of bullocks into the refrigerator cars. Before the first streaks of daylight there came the crowding throngs of workingmen, shivering, and swinging their dinner pails as they hurried by. Jurgis took up his stand by the time-office window, where alone there was light enough for him to see; the snow fell so quick that it was only by peering closely that he could make sure that Ona did not pass him.</p>
<p>Seven o'clock came, the hour when the great packing machine began to move. Jurgis ought to have been at his place in the fertilizer mill; but instead he was waiting, in an agony of fear, for Ona. It was fifteen minutes after the hour when he saw a form emerge from the snow mist, and sprang toward it with a cry. It was she, running swiftly; as she saw him, she staggered forward, and half fell into his outstretched arms.</p>
<p>"What has been the matter?" he cried, anxiously. "Where have you been?"</p>
<p>It was several seconds before she could get breath to answer him. "I couldn't get home," she exclaimed. "The snow&#8212;the cars had stopped."</p>
<p>"But where were you then?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"I had to go home with a friend," she panted&#8212;"with Jadvyga."</p>
<p>Jurgis drew a deep breath; but then he noticed that she was sobbing and trembling&#8212;as if in one of those nervous crises that he dreaded so. "But what's the matter?" he cried. "What has happened?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Jurgis, I was so frightened!" she said, clinging to him wildly. "I have been so worried!"</p>
<p>They were near the time station window, and people were staring at them. Jurgis led her away. "How do you mean?" he asked, in perplexity.</p>
<p>"I was afraid&#8212;I was just afraid!" sobbed Ona. "I knew you wouldn't know where I was, and I didn't know what you might do. I tried to get home, but I was so tired. Oh, Jurgis, Jurgis!"</p>
<p>He was so glad to get her back that he could not think clearly about anything else. It did not seem strange to him that she should be so very much upset; all her fright and incoherent protestations did not matter since he had her back. He let her cry away her tears; and then, because it was nearly eight o'clock, and they would lose another hour if they delayed, he left her at the packing house door, with her ghastly white face and her haunted eyes of terror.</p>
<p>There was another brief interval. Christmas was almost come; and because the snow still held, and the searching cold, morning after morning Jurgis half carried his wife to her post, staggering with her through the darkness; until at last, one night, came the end.</p>
<p>It lacked but three days of the holidays. About midnight Marija and Elzbieta came home, exclaiming in alarm when they found that Ona had not come. The two had agreed to meet her; and, after waiting, had gone to the room where she worked; only to find that the ham-wrapping girls had quit work an hour before, and left. There was no snow that night, nor was it especially cold; and still Ona had not come! Something more serious must be wrong this time.</p>
<p>They aroused Jurgis, and he sat up and listened crossly to the story. She must have gone home again with Jadvyga, he said; Jadvyga lived only two blocks from the yards, and perhaps she had been tired. Nothing could have happened to her&#8212;and even if there had, there was nothing could be done about it until morning. Jurgis turned over in his bed, and was snoring again before the two had closed the door.</p>
<p>In the morning, however, he was up and out nearly an hour before the usual time. Jadvyga Marcinkus lived on the other side of the yards, beyond Halsted Street, with her mother and sisters, in a single basement room&#8212;for Mikolas had recently lost one hand from blood poisoning, and their marriage had been put off forever. The door of the room was in the rear, reached by a narrow court, and Jurgis saw a light in the window and heard something frying as he passed; he knocked, half expecting that Ona would answer.</p>
<p>Instead there was one of Jadvyga's little sisters, who gazed at him through a crack in the door. "Where's Ona?" he demanded; and the child looked at him in perplexity. "Ona?" she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Jurgis, "isn't she here?"</p>
<p>"No," said the child, and Jurgis gave a start. A moment later came Jadvyga, peering over the child's head. When she saw who it was, she slid around out of sight, for she was not quite dressed. Jurgis must excuse her, she began, her mother was very ill&#8212;</p>
<p>"Ona isn't here?" Jurgis demanded, too alarmed to wait for her to finish.</p>
<p>"Why, no," said Jadvyga. "What made you think she would be here? Had she said she was coming?"</p>
<p>"No," he answered. "But she hasn't come home&#8212;and I thought she would be here the same as before."</p>
<p>"As before?" echoed Jadvyga, in perplexity.</p>
<p>"The time she spent the night here," said Jurgis.</p>
<p>"There must be some mistake," she answered, quickly. "Ona has never spent the night here."</p>
<p>He was only half able to realize the words. "Why&#8212;why&#8212;" he exclaimed. "Two weeks ago. Jadvyga! She told me so the night it snowed, and she could not get home."</p>
<p>"There must be some mistake," declared the girl, again; "she didn't come here."</p>
<p>He steadied himself by the door-sill; and Jadvyga in her anxiety&#8212;for she was fond of Ona&#8212;opened the door wide, holding her jacket across her throat. "Are you sure you didn't misunderstand her?" she cried. "She must have meant somewhere else. She&#8212;"</p>
<p>"She said here," insisted Jurgis. "She told me all about you, and how you were, and what you said. Are you sure? You haven't forgotten? You weren't away?"</p>
<p>"No, no!" she exclaimed&#8212;and then came a peevish voice&#8212;"Jadvyga, you are giving the baby a cold. Shut the door!" Jurgis stood for half a minute more, stammering his perplexity through an eighth of an inch of crack; and then, as there was really nothing more to be said, he excused himself and went away.</p>
<p>He walked on half dazed, without knowing where he went. Ona had deceived him! She had lied to him! And what could it mean&#8212;where had she been? Where was she now? He could hardly grasp the thing&#8212;much less try to solve it; but a hundred wild surmises came to him, a sense of impending calamity overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>Because there was nothing else to do, he went back to the time office to watch again. He waited until nearly an hour after seven, and then went to the room where Ona worked to make inquiries of Ona's "forelady." The "forelady," he found, had not yet come; all the lines of cars that came from downtown were stalled&#8212;there had been an accident in the powerhouse, and no cars had been running since last night. Meantime, however, the ham-wrappers were working away, with some one else in charge of them. The girl who answered Jurgis was busy, and as she talked she looked to see if she were being watched. Then a man came up, wheeling a truck; he knew Jurgis for Ona's husband, and was curious about the mystery.</p>
<p>"Maybe the cars had something to do with it," he suggested&#8212;"maybe she had gone down-town."</p>
<p>"No," said Jurgis, "she never went down-town."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," said the man. Jurgis thought he saw him exchange a swift glance with the girl as he spoke, and he demanded quickly. "What do you know about it?"</p>
<p>But the man had seen that the boss was watching him; he started on again, pushing his truck. "I don't know anything about it," he said, over his shoulder. "How should I know where your wife goes?"</p>
<p>Then Jurgis went out again and paced up and down before the building. All the morning he stayed there, with no thought of his work. About noon he went to the police station to make inquiries, and then came back again for another anxious vigil. Finally, toward the middle of the afternoon, he set out for home once more.</p>
<p>He was walking out Ashland Avenue. The streetcars had begun running again, and several passed him, packed to the steps with people. The sight of them set Jurgis to thinking again of the man's sarcastic remark; and half involuntarily he found himself watching the cars&#8212;with the result that he gave a sudden startled exclamation, and stopped short in his tracks.</p>
<p>Then he broke into a run. For a whole block he tore after the car, only a little ways behind. That rusty black hat with the drooping red flower, it might not be Ona's, but there was very little likelihood of it. He would know for certain very soon, for she would get out two blocks ahead. He slowed down, and let the car go on.</p>
<p>She got out: and as soon as she was out of sight on the side street Jurgis broke into a run. Suspicion was rife in him now, and he was not ashamed to shadow her: he saw her turn the corner near their home, and then he ran again, and saw her as she went up the porch steps of the house. After that he turned back, and for five minutes paced up and down, his hands clenched tightly and his lips set, his mind in a turmoil. Then he went home and entered.</p>
<p>As he opened the door, he saw Elzbieta, who had also been looking for Ona, and had come home again. She was now on tiptoe, and had a finger on her lips. Jurgis waited until she was close to him.</p>
<p>"Don't make any noise," she whispered, hurriedly.</p>
<p>"What's the matter'?" he asked. "Ona is asleep," she panted. "She's been very ill. I'm afraid her mind's been wandering, Jurgis. She was lost on the street all night, and I've only just succeeded in getting her quiet."</p>
<p>"When did she come in?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Soon after you left this morning," said Elzbieta.</p>
<p>"And has she been out since?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not. She's so weak, Jurgis, she&#8212;"</p>
<p>And he set his teeth hard together. "You are lying to me," he said.</p>
<p>Elzbieta started, and turned pale. "Why!" she gasped. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>But Jurgis did not answer. He pushed her aside, and strode to the bedroom door and opened it.</p>
<p>Ona was sitting on the bed. She turned a startled look upon him as he entered. He closed the door in Elzbieta's face, and went toward his wife. "Where have you been?" he demanded.</p>
<p>She had her hands clasped tightly in her lap, and he saw that her face was as white as paper, and drawn with pain. She gasped once or twice as she tried to answer him, and then began, speaking low, and swiftly. "Jurgis, I&#8212;I think I have been out of my mind. I started to come last night, and I could not find the way. I walked&#8212;I walked all night, I think, and&#8212;and I only got home&#8212;this morning."</p>
<p>"You needed a rest," he said, in a hard tone. "Why did you go out again?"</p>
<p>He was looking her fairly in the face, and he could read the sudden fear and wild uncertainty that leaped into her eyes. "I&#8212;I had to go to&#8212;to the store," she gasped, almost in a whisper, "I had to go&#8212;"</p>
<p>"You are lying to me," said Jurgis. Then he clenched his hands and took a step toward her. "Why do you lie to me?" he cried, fiercely. "What are you doing that you have to lie to me?"</p>
<p>"Jurgis!" she exclaimed, starting up in fright. "Oh, Jurgis, how can you?"</p>
<p>"You have lied to me, I say!" he cried. "You told me you had been to Jadvyga's house that other night, and you hadn't. You had been where you were last night&#8212;somewheres downtown, for I saw you get off the car. Where were you?"</p>
<p>It was as if he had struck a knife into her. She seemed to go all to pieces. For half a second she stood, reeling and swaying, staring at him with horror in her eyes; then, with a cry of anguish, she tottered forward, stretching out her arms to him. But he stepped aside, deliberately, and let her fall. She caught herself at the side of the bed, and then sank down, burying her face in her hands and bursting into frantic weeping.</p>
<p>There came one of those hysterical crises that had so often dismayed him. Ona sobbed and wept, her fear and anguish building themselves up into long climaxes. Furious gusts of emotion would come sweeping over her, shaking her as the tempest shakes the trees upon the hills; all her frame would quiver and throb with them&#8212;it was as if some dreadful thing rose up within her and took possession of her, torturing her, tearing her. This thing had been wont to set Jurgis quite beside himself; but now he stood with his lips set tightly and his hands clenched&#8212;she might weep till she killed herself, but she should not move him this time&#8212;not an inch, not an inch. Because the sounds she made set his blood to running cold and his lips to quivering in spite of himself, he was glad of the diversion when Teta Elzbieta, pale with fright, opened the door and rushed in; yet he turned upon her with an oath. "Go out!" he cried, "go out!" And then, as she stood hesitating, about to speak, he seized her by the arm, and half flung her from the room, slamming the door and barring it with a table. Then he turned again and faced Ona, crying&#8212;"Now, answer me!"</p>
<p>Yet she did not hear him&#8212;she was still in the grip of the fiend. Jurgis could see her outstretched hands, shaking and twitching, roaming here and there over the bed at will, like living things; he could see convulsive shudderings start in her body and run through her limbs. She was sobbing and choking&#8212;it was as if there were too many sounds for one throat, they came chasing each other, like waves upon the sea. Then her voice would begin to rise into screams, louder and louder until it broke in wild, horrible peals of laughter. Jurgis bore it until he could bear it no longer, and then he sprang at her, seizing her by the shoulders and shaking her, shouting into her ear: "Stop it, I say! Stop it!"</p>
<p>She looked up at him, out of her agony; then she fell forward at his feet. She caught them in her hands, in spite of his efforts to step aside, and with her face upon the floor lay writhing. It made a choking in Jurgis' throat to hear her, and he cried again, more savagely than before: "Stop it, I say!"</p>
<p>This time she heeded him, and caught her breath and lay silent, save for the gasping sobs that wrenched all her frame. For a long minute she lay there, perfectly motionless, until a cold fear seized her husband, thinking that she was dying. Suddenly, however, he heard her voice, faintly: "Jurgis! Jurgis!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" he said.</p>
<p>He had to bend down to her, she was so weak. She was pleading with him, in broken phrases, painfully uttered: "Have faith in me! Believe me!"</p>
<p>"Believe what?" he cried.</p>
<p>"Believe that I&#8212;that I know best&#8212;that I love you! And do not ask me&#8212;what you did. Oh, Jurgis, please, please! It is for the best&#8212;it is&#8212;"</p>
<p>He started to speak again, but she rushed on frantically, heading him off. "If you will only do it! If you will only&#8212;only believe me! It wasn't my fault&#8212;I couldn't help it&#8212;it will be all right&#8212;it is nothing&#8212;it is no harm. Oh, Jurgis&#8212;please, please!"</p>
<p>She had hold of him, and was trying to raise herself to look at him; he could feel the palsied shaking of her hands and the heaving of the bosom she pressed against him. She managed to catch one of his hands and gripped it convulsively, drawing it to her face, and bathing it in her tears. "Oh, believe me, believe me!" she wailed again; and he shouted in fury, "I will not!"</p>
<p>But still she clung to him, wailing aloud in her despair: "Oh, Jurgis, think what you are doing! It will ruin us&#8212;it will ruin us! Oh, no, you must not do it! No, don't, don't do it. You must not do it! It will drive me mad&#8212;it will kill me&#8212;no, no, Jurgis, I am crazy&#8212;it is nothing. You do not really need to know. We can be happy&#8212;we can love each other just the same. Oh, please, please, believe me!"</p>
<p>Her words fairly drove him wild. He tore his hands loose, and flung her off. "Answer me," he cried. "God damn it, I say&#8212;answer me!"</p>
<p>She sank down upon the floor, beginning to cry again. It was like listening to the moan of a damned soul, and Jurgis could not stand it. He smote his fist upon the table by his side, and shouted again at her, "Answer me!"</p>
<p>She began to scream aloud, her voice like the voice of some wild beast: "Ah! Ah! I can't! I can't do it!"</p>
<p>"Why can't you do it?" he shouted.</p>
<p>"I don't know how!"</p>
<p>He sprang and caught her by the arm, lifting her up, and glaring into her face. "Tell me where you were last night!" he panted. "Quick, out with it!"</p>
<p>Then she began to whisper, one word at a time: "I&#8212;was in&#8212;a house&#8212;downtown&#8212;"</p>
<p>"What house? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>She tried to hide her eyes away, but he held her. "Miss Henderson's house," she gasped. He did not understand at first. "Miss Henderson's house," he echoed. And then suddenly, as in an explosion, the horrible truth burst over him, and he reeled and staggered back with a scream. He caught himself against the wall, and put his hand to his forehead, staring about him, and whispering, "Jesus! Jesus!"</p>
<p>An instant later he leaped at her, as she lay groveling at his feet. He seized her by the throat. "Tell me!" he gasped, hoarsely. "Quick! Who took you to that place?"</p>
<p>She tried to get away, making him furious; he thought it was fear, of the pain of his clutch&#8212;he did not understand that it was the agony of her shame. Still she answered him, "Connor."</p>
<p>"Connor," he gasped. "Who is Connor?"</p>
<p>"The boss," she answered. "The man&#8212;"</p>
<p>He tightened his grip, in his frenzy, and only when he saw her eyes closing did he realize that he was choking her. Then he relaxed his fingers, and crouched, waiting, until she opened her lids again. His breath beat hot into her face.</p>
<p>"Tell me," he whispered, at last, "tell me about it."</p>
<p>She lay perfectly motionless, and he had to hold his breath to catch her words. "I did not want&#8212;to do it," she said; "I tried&#8212;I tried not to do it. I only did it&#8212;to save us. It was our only chance."</p>
<p>Again, for a space, there was no sound but his panting. Ona's eyes closed and when she spoke again she did not open them. "He told me&#8212;he would have me turned off. He told me he would&#8212;we would all of us lose our places. We could never get anything to do&#8212;here&#8212;again. He&#8212;he meant it&#8212;he would have ruined us."</p>
<p>Jurgis' arms were shaking so that he could scarcely hold himself up, and lurched forward now and then as he listened. "When&#8212;when did this begin?" he gasped.</p>
<p>"At the very first," she said. She spoke as if in a trance. "It was all&#8212;it was their plot&#8212;Miss Henderson's plot. She hated me. And he&#8212;he wanted me. He used to speak to me&#8212;out on the platform. Then he began to&#8212;to make love to me. He offered me money. He begged me&#8212;he said he loved me. Then he threatened me. He knew all about us, he knew we would starve. He knew your boss&#8212;he knew Marija's. He would hound us to death, he said&#8212;then he said if I would&#8212;if I&#8212;we would all of us be sure of work&#8212;always. Then one day he caught hold of me&#8212;he would not let go&#8212;he&#8212;he&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Where was this?"</p>
<p>"In the hallway&#8212;at night&#8212;after every one had gone. I could not help it. I thought of you&#8212;of the baby&#8212;of mother and the children. I was afraid of him&#8212;afraid to cry out."</p>
<p>A moment ago her face had been ashen gray, now it was scarlet. She was beginning to breathe hard again. Jurgis made not a sound.</p>
<p>"That was two months ago. Then he wanted me to come&#8212;to that house. He wanted me to stay there. He said all of us&#8212;that we would not have to work. He made me come there&#8212;in the evenings. I told you&#8212;you thought I was at the factory. Then&#8212;one night it snowed, and I couldn't get back. And last night&#8212;the cars were stopped. It was such a little thing&#8212;to ruin us all. I tried to walk, but I couldn't. I didn't want you to know. It would have&#8212;it would have been all right. We could have gone on&#8212;just the same&#8212;you need never have known about it. He was getting tired of me&#8212;he would have let me alone soon. I am going to have a baby&#8212;I am getting ugly. He told me that&#8212;twice, he told me, last night. He kicked me&#8212;last night&#8212;too. And now you will kill him&#8212;you&#8212;you will kill him&#8212;and we shall die."</p>
<p>All this she had said without a quiver; she lay still as death, not an eyelid moving. And Jurgis, too, said not a word. He lifted himself by the bed, and stood up. He did not stop for another glance at her, but went to the door and opened it. He did not see Elzbieta, crouching terrified in the corner. He went out, hatless, leaving the street door open behind him. The instant his feet were on the sidewalk he broke into a run.</p>
<p>He ran like one possessed, blindly, furiously, looking neither to the right nor left. He was on Ashland Avenue before exhaustion compelled him to slow down, and then, noticing a car, he made a dart for it and drew himself aboard. His eyes were wild and his hair flying, and he was breathing hoarsely, like a wounded bull; but the people on the car did not notice this particularly&#8212;perhaps it seemed natural to them that a man who smelled as Jurgis smelled should exhibit an aspect to correspond. They began to give way before him as usual. The conductor took his nickel gingerly, with the tips of his fingers, and then left him with the platform to himself. Jurgis did not even notice it&#8212;his thoughts were far away. Within his soul it was like a roaring furnace; he stood waiting, waiting, crouching as if for a spring.</p>
<p>He had some of his breath back when the car came to the entrance of the yards, and so he leaped off and started again, racing at full speed. People turned and stared at him, but he saw no one&#8212;there was the factory, and he bounded through the doorway and down the corridor. He knew the room where Ona worked, and he knew Connor, the boss of the loading-gang outside. He looked for the man as he sprang into the room.</p>
<p>The truckmen were hard at work, loading the freshly packed boxes and barrels upon the cars. Jurgis shot one swift glance up and down the platform&#8212;the man was not on it. But then suddenly he heard a voice in the corridor, and started for it with a bound. In an instant more he fronted the boss.</p>
<p>He was a big, red-faced Irishman, coarse-featured, and smelling of liquor. He saw Jurgis as he crossed the threshold, and turned white. He hesitated one second, as if meaning to run; and in the next his assailant was upon him. He put up his hands to protect his face, but Jurgis, lunging with all the power of his arm and body, struck him fairly between the eyes and knocked him backward. The next moment he was on top of him, burying his fingers in his throat.</p>
<p>To Jurgis this man's whole presence reeked of the crime he had committed; the touch of his body was madness to him&#8212;it set every nerve of him a-tremble, it aroused all the demon in his soul. It had worked its will upon Ona, this great beast&#8212;and now he had it, he had it! It was his turn now! Things swam blood before him, and he screamed aloud in his fury, lifting his victim and smashing his head upon the floor.</p>
<p>The place, of course, was in an uproar; women fainting and shrieking, and men rushing in. Jurgis was so bent upon his task that he knew nothing of this, and scarcely realized that people were trying to interfere with him; it was only when half a dozen men had seized him by the legs and shoulders and were pulling at him, that he understood that he was losing his prey. In a flash he had bent down and sunk his teeth into the man's cheek; and when they tore him away he was dripping with blood, and little ribbons of skin were hanging in his mouth.</p>
<p>They got him down upon the floor, clinging to him by his arms and legs, and still they could hardly hold him. He fought like a tiger, writhing and twisting, half flinging them off, and starting toward his unconscious enemy. But yet others rushed in, until there was a little mountain of twisted limbs and bodies, heaving and tossing, and working its way about the room. In the end, by their sheer weight, they choked the breath out of him, and then they carried him to the company police station, where he lay still until they had summoned a patrol wagon to take him away.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00017">Chapter 16</h2>
<p>When Jurgis got up again he went quietly enough. He was exhausted and half-dazed, and besides he saw the blue uniforms of the policemen. He drove in a patrol wagon with half a dozen of them watching him; keeping as far away as possible, however, on account of the fertilizer. Then he stood before the sergeant's desk and gave his name and address, and saw a charge of assault and battery entered against him. On his way to his cell a burly policeman cursed him because he started down the wrong corridor, and then added a kick when he was not quick enough; nevertheless, Jurgis did not even lift his eyes&#8212;he had lived two years and a half in Packingtown, and he knew what the police were. It was as much as a man's very life was worth to anger them, here in their inmost lair; like as not a dozen would pile on to him at once, and pound his face into a pulp. It would be nothing unusual if he got his skull cracked in the melee&#8212;in which case they would report that he had been drunk and had fallen down, and there would be no one to know the difference or to care.</p>
<p>So a barred door clanged upon Jurgis and he sat down upon a bench and buried his face in his hands. He was alone; he had the afternoon and all of the night to himself.</p>
<p>At first he was like a wild beast that has glutted itself; he was in a dull stupor of satisfaction. He had done up the scoundrel pretty well&#8212;not as well as he would have if they had given him a minute more, but pretty well, all the same; the ends of his fingers were still tingling from their contact with the fellow's throat. But then, little by little, as his strength came back and his senses cleared, he began to see beyond his momentary gratification; that he had nearly killed the boss would not help Ona&#8212;not the horrors that she had borne, nor the memory that would haunt her all her days. It would not help to feed her and her child; she would certainly lose her place, while he&#8212;what was to happen to him God only knew.</p>
<p>Half the night he paced the floor, wrestling with this nightmare; and when he was exhausted he lay down, trying to sleep, but finding instead, for the first time in his life, that his brain was too much for him. In the cell next to him was a drunken wife-beater and in the one beyond a yelling maniac. At midnight they opened the station house to the homeless wanderers who were crowded about the door, shivering in the winter blast, and they thronged into the corridor outside of the cells. Some of them stretched themselves out on the bare stone floor and fell to snoring, others sat up, laughing and talking, cursing and quarreling. The air was fetid with their breath, yet in spite of this some of them smelled Jurgis and called down the torments of hell upon him, while he lay in a far corner of his cell, counting the throbbings of the blood in his forehead.</p>
<p>They had brought him his supper, which was "duffers and dope"&#8212;being hunks of dry bread on a tin plate, and coffee, called "dope" because it was drugged to keep the prisoners quiet. Jurgis had not known this, or he would have swallowed the stuff in desperation; as it was, every nerve of him was a-quiver with shame and rage. Toward morning the place fell silent, and he got up and began to pace his cell; and then within the soul of him there rose up a fiend, red-eyed and cruel, and tore out the strings of his heart.</p>
<p>It was not for himself that he suffered&#8212;what did a man who worked in Durham's fertilizer mill care about anything that the world might do to him! What was any tyranny of prison compared with the tyranny of the past, of the thing that had happened and could not be recalled, of the memory that could never be effaced! The horror of it drove him mad; he stretched out his arms to heaven, crying out for deliverance from it&#8212;and there was no deliverance, there was no power even in heaven that could undo the past. It was a ghost that would not drown; it followed him, it seized upon him and beat him to the ground. Ah, if only he could have foreseen it&#8212;but then, he would have foreseen it, if he had not been a fool! He smote his hands upon his forehead, cursing himself because he had ever allowed Ona to work where she had, because he had not stood between her and a fate which every one knew to be so common. He should have taken her away, even if it were to lie down and die of starvation in the gutters of Chicago's streets! And now&#8212;oh, it could not be true; it was too monstrous, too horrible.</p>
<p>It was a thing that could not be faced; a new shuddering seized him every time he tried to think of it. No, there was no bearing the load of it, there was no living under it. There would be none for her&#8212;he knew that he might pardon her, might plead with her on his knees, but she would never look him in the face again, she would never be his wife again. The shame of it would kill her&#8212;there could be no other deliverance, and it was best that she should die.</p>
<p>This was simple and clear, and yet, with cruel inconsistency, whenever he escaped from this nightmare it was to suffer and cry out at the vision of Ona starving. They had put him in jail, and they would keep him here a long time, years maybe. And Ona would surely not go to work again, broken and crushed as she was. And Elzbieta and Marija, too, might lose their places&#8212;if that hell fiend Connor chose to set to work to ruin them, they would all be turned out. And even if he did not, they could not live&#8212;even if the boys left school again, they could surely not pay all the bills without him and Ona. They had only a few dollars now&#8212;they had just paid the rent of the house a week ago, and that after it was two weeks overdue. So it would be due again in a week! They would have no money to pay it then&#8212;and they would lose the house, after all their long, heartbreaking struggle. Three times now the agent had warned him that he would not tolerate another delay. Perhaps it was very base of Jurgis to be thinking about the house when he had the other unspeakable thing to fill his mind; yet, how much he had suffered for this house, how much they had all of them suffered! It was their one hope of respite, as long as they lived; they had put all their money into it&#8212;and they were working people, poor people, whose money was their strength, the very substance of them, body and soul, the thing by which they lived and for lack of which they died.</p>
<p>And they would lose it all; they would be turned out into the streets, and have to hide in some icy garret, and live or die as best they could! Jurgis had all the night&#8212;and all of many more nights&#8212;to think about this, and he saw the thing in its details; he lived it all, as if he were there. They would sell their furniture, and then run into debt at the stores, and then be refused credit; they would borrow a little from the Szedvilases, whose delicatessen store was tottering on the brink of ruin; the neighbors would come and help them a little&#8212;poor, sick Jadvyga would bring a few spare pennies, as she always did when people were starving, and Tamoszius Kuszleika would bring them the proceeds of a night's fiddling. So they would struggle to hang on until he got out of jail&#8212;or would they know that he was in jail, would they be able to find out anything about him? Would they be allowed to see him&#8212;or was it to be part of his punishment to be kept in ignorance about their fate?</p>
<p>His mind would hang upon the worst possibilities; he saw Ona ill and tortured, Marija out of her place, little Stanislovas unable to get to work for the snow, the whole family turned out on the street. God Almighty! would they actually let them lie down in the street and die? Would there be no help even then&#8212;would they wander about in the snow till they froze? Jurgis had never seen any dead bodies in the streets, but he had seen people evicted and disappear, no one knew where; and though the city had a relief bureau, though there was a charity organization society in the stockyards district, in all his life there he had never heard of either of them. They did not advertise their activities, having more calls than they could attend to without that.</p>
<p>&#8212;So on until morning. Then he had another ride in the patrol wagon, along with the drunken wife-beater and the maniac, several "plain drunks" and "saloon fighters," a burglar, and two men who had been arrested for stealing meat from the packing houses. Along with them he was driven into a large, white-walled room, stale-smelling and crowded. In front, upon a raised platform behind a rail, sat a stout, florid-faced personage, with a nose broken out in purple blotches.</p>
<p>Our friend realized vaguely that he was about to be tried. He wondered what for&#8212;whether or not his victim might be dead, and if so, what they would do with him. Hang him, perhaps, or beat him to death&#8212;nothing would have surprised Jurgis, who knew little of the laws. Yet he had picked up gossip enough to have it occur to him that the loud-voiced man upon the bench might be the notorious Justice Callahan, about whom the people of Packingtown spoke with bated breath.</p>
<p>"Pat" Callahan&#8212;"Growler" Pat, as he had been known before he ascended the bench&#8212;had begun life as a butcher boy and a bruiser of local reputation; he had gone into politics almost as soon as he had learned to talk, and had held two offices at once before he was old enough to vote. If Scully was the thumb, Pat Callahan was the first finger of the unseen hand whereby the packers held down the people of the district. No politician in Chicago ranked higher in their confidence; he had been at it a long time&#8212;had been the business agent in the city council of old Durham, the self-made merchant, way back in the early days, when the whole city of Chicago had been up at auction. "Growler" Pat had given up holding city offices very early in his career&#8212;caring only for party power, and giving the rest of his time to superintending his dives and brothels. Of late years, however, since his children were growing up, he had begun to value respectability, and had had himself made a magistrate; a position for which he was admirably fitted, because of his strong conservatism and his contempt for "foreigners."</p>
<p>Jurgis sat gazing about the room for an hour or two; he was in hopes that some one of the family would come, but in this he was disappointed. Finally, he was led before the bar, and a lawyer for the company appeared against him. Connor was under the doctor's care, the lawyer explained briefly, and if his Honor would hold the prisoner for a week&#8212;"Three hundred dollars," said his Honor, promptly.</p>
<p>Jurgis was staring from the judge to the lawyer in perplexity. "Have you any one to go on your bond?" demanded the judge, and then a clerk who stood at Jurgis' elbow explained to him what this meant. The latter shook his head, and before he realized what had happened the policemen were leading him away again. They took him to a room where other prisoners were waiting and here he stayed until court adjourned, when he had another long and bitterly cold ride in a patrol wagon to the county jail, which is on the north side of the city, and nine or ten miles from the stockyards.</p>
<p>Here they searched Jurgis, leaving him only his money, which consisted of fifteen cents. Then they led him to a room and told him to strip for a bath; after which he had to walk down a long gallery, past the grated cell doors of the inmates of the jail. This was a great event to the latter&#8212;the daily review of the new arrivals, all stark naked, and many and diverting were the comments. Jurgis was required to stay in the bath longer than any one, in the vain hope of getting out of him a few of his phosphates and acids. The prisoners roomed two in a cell, but that day there was one left over, and he was the one.</p>
<p>The cells were in tiers, opening upon galleries. His cell was about five feet by seven in size, with a stone floor and a heavy wooden bench built into it. There was no window&#8212;the only light came from windows near the roof at one end of the court outside. There were two bunks, one above the other, each with a straw mattress and a pair of gray blankets&#8212;the latter stiff as boards with filth, and alive with fleas, bedbugs, and lice. When Jurgis lifted up the mattress he discovered beneath it a layer of scurrying roaches, almost as badly frightened as himself.</p>
<p>Here they brought him more "duffers and dope," with the addition of a bowl of soup. Many of the prisoners had their meals brought in from a restaurant, but Jurgis had no money for that. Some had books to read and cards to play, with candles to burn by night, but Jurgis was all alone in darkness and silence. He could not sleep again; there was the same maddening procession of thoughts that lashed him like whips upon his naked back. When night fell he was pacing up and down his cell like a wild beast that breaks its teeth upon the bars of its cage. Now and then in his frenzy he would fling himself against the walls of the place, beating his hands upon them. They cut him and bruised him&#8212;they were cold and merciless as the men who had built them.</p>
<p>In the distance there was a church-tower bell that tolled the hours one by one. When it came to midnight Jurgis was lying upon the floor with his head in his arms, listening. Instead of falling silent at the end, the bell broke into a sudden clangor. Jurgis raised his head; what could that mean&#8212;a fire? God! Suppose there were to be a fire in this jail! But then he made out a melody in the ringing; there were chimes. And they seemed to waken the city&#8212;all around, far and near, there were bells, ringing wild music; for fully a minute Jurgis lay lost in wonder, before, all at once, the meaning of it broke over him&#8212;that this was Christmas Eve!</p>
<p>Christmas Eve&#8212;he had forgotten it entirely! There was a breaking of floodgates, a whirl of new memories and new griefs rushing into his mind. In far Lithuania they had celebrated Christmas; and it came to him as if it had been yesterday&#8212;himself a little child, with his lost brother and his dead father in the cabin&#8212;in the deep black forest, where the snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the world. It was too far off for Santa Claus in Lithuania, but it was not too far for peace and good will to men, for the wonder-bearing vision of the Christ Child. And even in Packingtown they had not forgotten it&#8212;some gleam of it had never failed to break their darkness. Last Christmas Eve and all Christmas Day Jurgis had toiled on the killing beds, and Ona at wrapping hams, and still they had found strength enough to take the children for a walk upon the avenue, to see the store windows all decorated with Christmas trees and ablaze with electric lights. In one window there would be live geese, in another marvels in sugar&#8212;pink and white canes big enough for ogres, and cakes with cherubs upon them; in a third there would be rows of fat yellow turkeys, decorated with rosettes, and rabbits and squirrels hanging; in a fourth would be a fairyland of toys&#8212;lovely dolls with pink dresses, and woolly sheep and drums and soldier hats. Nor did they have to go without their share of all this, either. The last time they had had a big basket with them and all their Christmas marketing to do&#8212;a roast of pork and a cabbage and some rye bread, and a pair of mittens for Ona, and a rubber doll that squeaked, and a little green cornucopia full of candy to be hung from the gas jet and gazed at by half a dozen pairs of longing eyes.</p>
<p>Even half a year of the sausage machines and the fertilizer mill had not been able to kill the thought of Christmas in them; there was a choking in Jurgis' throat as he recalled that the very night Ona had not come home Teta Elzbieta had taken him aside and shown him an old valentine that she had picked up in a paper store for three cents&#8212;dingy and shopworn, but with bright colors, and figures of angels and doves. She had wiped all the specks off this, and was going to set it on the mantel, where the children could see it. Great sobs shook Jurgis at this memory&#8212;they would spend their Christmas in misery and despair, with him in prison and Ona ill and their home in desolation. Ah, it was too cruel! Why at least had they not left him alone&#8212;why, after they had shut him in jail, must they be ringing Christmas chimes in his ears!</p>
<p>But no, their bells were not ringing for him&#8212;their Christmas was not meant for him, they were simply not counting him at all. He was of no consequence&#8212;he was flung aside, like a bit of trash, the carcass of some animal. It was horrible, horrible! His wife might be dying, his baby might be starving, his whole family might be perishing in the cold&#8212;and all the while they were ringing their Christmas chimes! And the bitter mockery of it&#8212;all this was punishment for him! They put him in a place where the snow could not beat in, where the cold could not eat through his bones; they brought him food and drink&#8212;why, in the name of heaven, if they must punish him, did they not put his family in jail and leave him outside&#8212;why could they find no better way to punish him than to leave three weak women and six helpless children to starve and freeze? That was their law, that was their justice!</p>
<p>Jurgis stood upright; trembling with passion, his hands clenched and his arms upraised, his whole soul ablaze with hatred and defiance. Ten thousand curses upon them and their law! Their justice&#8212;it was a lie, it was a lie, a hideous, brutal lie, a thing too black and hateful for any world but a world of nightmares. It was a sham and a loathsome mockery. There was no justice, there was no right, anywhere in it&#8212;it was only force, it was tyranny, the will and the power, reckless and unrestrained! They had ground him beneath their heel, they had devoured all his substance; they had murdered his old father, they had broken and wrecked his wife, they had crushed and cowed his whole family; and now they were through with him, they had no further use for him&#8212;and because he had interfered with them, had gotten in their way, this was what they had done to him! They had put him behind bars, as if he had been a wild beast, a thing without sense or reason, without rights, without affections, without feelings. Nay, they would not even have treated a beast as they had treated him! Would any man in his senses have trapped a wild thing in its lair, and left its young behind to die?</p>
<p>These midnight hours were fateful ones to Jurgis; in them was the beginning of his rebellion, of his outlawry and his unbelief. He had no wit to trace back the social crime to its far sources&#8212;he could not say that it was the thing men have called "the system" that was crushing him to the earth; that it was the packers, his masters, who had bought up the law of the land, and had dealt out their brutal will to him from the seat of justice. He only knew that he was wronged, and that the world had wronged him; that the law, that society, with all its powers, had declared itself his foe. And every hour his soul grew blacker, every hour he dreamed new dreams of vengeance, of defiance, of raging, frenzied hate.</p>
