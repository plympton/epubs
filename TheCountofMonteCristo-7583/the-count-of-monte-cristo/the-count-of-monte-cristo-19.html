<p id="id04847">"No, madame, I did not say as much as that," replied the count with a
smile; "quite the contrary. I have studied chemistry because, having
determined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of following
the example of King Mithridates."</p>

<p id="id04848">"Mithridates rex Ponticus," said the young scamp, as he tore some
beautiful portraits out of a splendid album, "the individual who took
cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast."</p>

<p id="id04849">"Edward, you naughty boy," exclaimed Madame de Villefort, snatching
the mutilated book from the urchin's grasp, "you are positively past
bearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave us, and join
your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtier's room."</p>

<p id="id04850">"The album," said Edward sulkily.</p>

<p id="id04851">"What do you mean?&#8212;the album!"</p>

<p id="id04852">"I want the album."</p>

<p id="id04853">"How dare you tear out the drawings?"</p>

<p id="id04854">"Oh, it amuses me."</p>

<p id="id04855">"Go&#8212;go at once."</p>

<p id="id04856">"I won't go unless you give me the album," said the boy, seating himself
doggedly in an arm-chair, according to his habit of never giving way.</p>

<p id="id04857">"Take it, then, and pray disturb us no longer," said Madame de
Villefort, giving the album to Edward, who then went towards the door,
led by his mother. The count followed her with his eyes.</p>

<p id="id04858">"Let us see if she shuts the door after him," he muttered. Madame de
Villefort closed the door carefully after the child, the count appearing
not to notice her; then casting a scrutinizing glance around the
chamber, the young wife returned to her chair, in which she seated
herself. "Allow me to observe, madame," said the count, with that kind
tone he could assume so well, "you are really very severe with that dear
clever child."</p>

<p id="id04859">"Oh, sometimes severity is quite necessary," replied Madame de<br/>

Villefort, with all a mother's real firmness.<br/></p>

<p id="id04860">"It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he
referred to King Mithridates," continued the count, "and you interrupted
him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected
him, for your son is really advanced for his years."</p>

<p id="id04861">"The fact is, count," answered the mother, agreeably flattered, "he has
great aptitude, and learns all that is set before him. He has but one
fault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment
to what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these
precautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?"</p>

<p id="id04862">"I think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I
might not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrna&#8212;that is to
say, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must
have lost my life."</p>

<p id="id04863">"And your precautions were successful?"</p>

<p id="id04864">"Completely so."</p>

<p id="id04865">"Yes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this
sort."</p>

<p id="id04866">"Indeed?" said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well
counterfeited; "I really did not remember."</p>

<p id="id04867">"I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect,
on men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that the
cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same aptitude
as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the South."</p>

<p id="id04868">"And that is the case," observed Monte Cristo. "I have seen Russians
devour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable substances which
would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab."</p>

<p id="id04869">"And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us
than in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man
would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this
progressive absorption of poison?"</p>

<p id="id04870">"Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he
should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not
been accustomed."</p>

<p id="id04871">"Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for
instance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?"</p>

<p id="id04872">"Oh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would
be made use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance,
brucine"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04873">"Brucine is extracted from the false angostura [*] is it not?" inquired<br/>

Madame de Villefort.<br/></p>

<p id="id04874">"Precisely, madame," replied Monte Cristo; "but I perceive I have not
much to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such
learning is very rare among ladies."</p>

<p id="id04875">    * Brucoea ferruginea.</p>

<p id="id04876">"Oh, I am aware of that," said Madame de Villefort; "but I have a
passion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like
poetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but go
on, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree."</p>

<p id="id04877">"Well," replied Monte Cristo "suppose, then, that this poison was
brucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two
milligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days you
would have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days, increasing
another milligramme, you would have taken three hundred centigrammes;
that is to say, a dose which you would support without inconvenience,
and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken
the same precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the end of a month,
when drinking water from the same carafe, you would kill the person
who drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise than from slight
inconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this
water."</p>

<p id="id04878">"Do you know any other counter-poisons?"</p>

<p id="id04879">"I do not."</p>

<p id="id04880">"I have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates," said
Madame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, "and had always considered
it a fable."</p>

<p id="id04881">"No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell me,
madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance query, for
two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said then, that for a
very long time this history of Mithridates had occupied your mind."</p>

<p id="id04882">"True, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and
mineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples
frequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life
of individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love
affair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a
Flamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis."</p>

<p id="id04883">"And the more, madame," said Monte Cristo, "as the Orientals do not
confine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass of his
poisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in their
hands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an
offensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings,
the other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucaea,
snake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in
their way. There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or
Greek, whom here you call 'good women,' who do not know how, by means of
chemistry, to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a confessor."</p>

<p id="id04884">"Really," said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with strange
fire at this conversation.</p>

<p id="id04885">"Oh, yes, indeed, madame," continued Monte Cristo, "the secret dramas
of the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion&#8212;begin
with paradise and end with&#8212;hell. There are as many elixirs of every
kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral
nature of humanity; and I will say further&#8212;the art of these chemists
is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the
remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance."</p>

<p id="id04886">"But, sir," remarked the young woman, "these Eastern societies, in
the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence, are
as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land. A man can
easily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and
Bassora of the 'Thousand and One Nights.' The sultans and viziers who
rule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the
government, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only
pardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has
been an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the whole
story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of idleness and
ennui."</p>

<p id="id04887">"By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There,
disguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are
police agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They
hang, behead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible
manner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape
human justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning
stratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or
cupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose
of, goes straight to the grocer's or druggist's, gives a false name,
which leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under
the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or
six grammes of arsenic&#8212;if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to
five or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only
five or six times more easily traced;&#8212;then, when he has acquired his
specific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of
arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which, without
rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire
neighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables. They
fetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the entrails
and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a hundred
newspapers relate the fact, with the names of the victim and the
murderer. The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or druggists,
come and say, 'It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman;' and
rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they will recognize
twenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned, interrogated,
confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or steel; or if
she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for life. This
is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry, madame. Desrues
was, however, I must confess, more skilful."</p>

<p id="id04888">"What would you have, sir?" said the lady, laughing; "we do what we can.<br/>

All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias."<br/></p>

<p id="id04889">"Now," replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, "shall I tell you the
cause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your theatres, by what
at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see persons
swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring, and
fall dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls, and the
spectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the murder;
they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office, nor the
corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools believe that the whole
thing is as easy as lying. But go a little way from France&#8212;go either
to Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome, and you will see people
passing by you in the streets&#8212;people erect, smiling, and fresh-colored,
of whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle,
would say, 'That man was poisoned three weeks ago; he will be a dead man
in a month.'"</p>

<p id="id04890">"Then," remarked Madame de Villefort, "they have again discovered the
secret of the famous aquatofana that they said was lost at Perugia."</p>

<p id="id04891">"Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change about
and make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the
vulgar do not follow them&#8212;that is all; but there is always the same
result. Poisons act particularly on some organ or another&#8212;one on the
stomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the
poison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or
some other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however,
by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were
not, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by
foolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in
favor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a human
being killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of
whom justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my
acquaintance, the worthy Abbe Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has
studied these national phenomena very profoundly."</p>

<p id="id04892">"It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting," said the young lady,
motionless with attention. "I thought, I must confess, that these tales,
were inventions of the Middle Ages."</p>

<p id="id04893">"Yes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time,
rewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead
society towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect
until he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and
that is half the battle."</p>

<p id="id04894">"So," added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object,
"the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Renes, the Ruggieris,
and later, probably, that of Baron de Trenck, whose story has been so
misused by modern drama and romance"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04895">"Were objects of art, madame, and nothing more," replied the count. "Do
you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere
individual? By no means. Science loves eccentricities, leaps and bounds,
trials of strength, fancies, if I may be allowed so to term them. Thus,
for instance, the excellent Abbe Adelmonte, of whom I spoke just now,
made in this way some marvellous experiments."</p>

<p id="id04896">"Really?"</p>

<p id="id04897">"Yes; I will mention one to you. He had a remarkably fine garden, full
of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. From amongst these vegetables he
selected the most simple&#8212;a cabbage, for instance. For three days he
watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the
cabbage began to droop and turn yellow. At that moment he cut it. In the
eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its wholesome
appearance. It was only poisoned to the Abbe Adelmonte. He then took the
cabbage to the room where he had rabbits&#8212;for the Abbe Adelmonte had
a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as fine as his
collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Well, the Abbe Adelmonte
took a rabbit, and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage. The rabbit died.
What magistrate would find, or even venture to insinuate, anything
against this? What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation
against M. Magendie or M. Flourens, in consequence of the rabbits, cats,
and guinea-pigs they have killed?&#8212;not one. So, then, the rabbit dies,
and justice takes no notice. This rabbit dead, the Abbe Adelmonte has
its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill; on this
dunghill is a hen, who, pecking these intestines, is in her turn taken
ill, and dies next day. At the moment when she is struggling in the
convulsions of death, a vulture is flying by (there are a good many
vultures in Adelmonte's country); this bird darts on the dead fowl,
and carries it away to a rock, where it dines off its prey. Three days
afterwards, this poor vulture, which has been very much indisposed since
that dinner, suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the
clouds, and falls heavily into a fish-pond. The pike, eels, and carp eat
greedily always, as everybody knows&#8212;well, they feast on the vulture.
Now suppose that next day, one of these eels, or pike, or carp, poisoned
at the fourth remove, is served up at your table. Well, then, your guest
will be poisoned at the fifth remove, and die, at the end of eight
or ten days, of pains in the intestines, sickness, or abscess of the
pylorus. The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound
learning, 'The subject has died of a tumor on the liver, or of typhoid
fever!'"</p>

<p id="id04898">"But," remarked Madame de Villefort, "all these circumstances which
you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident; the
vulture may not see the fowl, or may fall a hundred yards from the
fish-pond."</p>

<p id="id04899">"Ah, that is where the art comes in. To be a great chemist in the
East, one must direct chance; and this is to be achieved."&#8212;Madame de
Villefort was in deep thought, yet listened attentively. "But,"
she exclaimed, suddenly, "arsenic is indelible, indestructible; in
whatsoever way it is absorbed, it will be found again in the body of the
victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to
cause death."</p>

<p id="id04900">"Precisely so," cried Monte Cristo&#8212;"precisely so; and this is what I
said to my worthy Adelmonte. He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by
a Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, 'My son,
the world was not made in a day&#8212;but in seven. Return on Sunday.' On
the Sunday following I did return to him. Instead of having watered his
cabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of
salts, having their basis in strychnine, strychnos colubrina, as the
learned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of
disease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust; yet,
five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at the
rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we were the
vultures; so we opened the bird, and this time all special symptoms had
disappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no peculiar
indication in any organ&#8212;an excitement of the nervous system&#8212;that was
it; a case of cerebral congestion&#8212;nothing more. The fowl had not been
poisoned&#8212;she had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease among
fowls, I believe, but very common among men." Madame de Villefort
appeared more and more thoughtful.</p>

<p id="id04901">"It is very fortunate," she observed, "that such substances could only
be prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world would be poisoning
each other."</p>

<p id="id04902">"By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry," said Monte<br/>

Cristo carelessly.<br/></p>

<p id="id04903">"And then," said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and
with effort, to get away from her thoughts, "however skilfully it is
prepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it does
not escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are in
cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell&#8212;that is the
point."</p>

<p id="id04904">"Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure
mind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.
The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of
Jean Jacques Rousseau,&#8212;you remember,&#8212;the mandarin who is killed five
hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man's whole
life passes in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by
reflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and
brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will
administer to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe
on which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of
which we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule&#8212;eccentric
or stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to
thirty-six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the
feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is
permissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym,
then, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an
'elimination;' you merely and simply remove from your path the
individual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence,
without the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a
punishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense
of the word, of him who inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no
groans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid
and compromising moment of accomplishing the act,&#8212;then one escapes the
clutch of the human law, which says, 'Do not disturb society!' This
is the mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern
climes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very
little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance."</p>

<p id="id04905">"Yet conscience remains," remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated
voice, and with a stifled sigh.</p>

<p id="id04906">"Yes," answered Monte Cristo "happily, yes, conscience does remain; and
if it did not, how wretched we should be! After every action requiring
exertion, it is conscience that saves us, for it supplies us with a
thousand good excuses, of which we alone are judges; and these reasons,
howsoever excellent in producing sleep, would avail us but very little
before a tribunal, when we were tried for our lives. Thus Richard
III., for instance, was marvellously served by his conscience after the
putting away of the two children of Edward IV.; in fact, he could say,
'These two children of a cruel and persecuting king, who have inherited
the vices of their father, which I alone could perceive in their
juvenile propensities&#8212;these two children are impediments in my way of
promoting the happiness of the English people, whose unhappiness they
(the children) would infallibly have caused.' Thus was Lady Macbeth
served by her conscience, when she sought to give her son, and not her
husband (whatever Shakespeare may say), a throne. Ah, maternal love is a
great virtue, a powerful motive&#8212;so powerful that it excuses a multitude
of things, even if, after Duncan's death, Lady Macbeth had been at all
pricked by her conscience."</p>

<p id="id04907">Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and
horrible paradoxes, delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity
which was peculiar to him. After a moment's silence, the lady inquired,
"Do you know, my dear count," she said, "that you are a very terrible
reasoner, and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered
medium? Have you really measured the world by scrutinies, or through
alembics and crucibles? For you must indeed be a great chemist, and the
elixir you administered to my son, which recalled him to life almost
instantaneously"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04908">"Oh, do not place any reliance on that, madame; one drop of that elixir
sufficed to recall life to a dying child, but three drops would have
impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced
most violent palpitations; six would have suspended his respiration, and
caused syncope more serious than that in which he was; ten would have
destroyed him. You know, madame, how suddenly I snatched him from those
phials which he so imprudently touched?"</p>

<p id="id04909">"Is it then so terrible a poison?"</p>

<p id="id04910">"Oh, no. In the first place, let us agree that the word poison does
not exist, because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons,
which become, according as they are employed, most salutary remedies."</p>

<p id="id04911">"What, then, is it?"</p>

<p id="id04912">"A skilful preparation of my friend's the worthy Abbe Adelmonte, who
taught me the use of it."</p>

<p id="id04913">"Oh," observed Madame de Villefort, "it must be an admirable
anti-spasmodic."</p>

<p id="id04914">"Perfect, madame, as you have seen," replied the count; "and I
frequently make use of it&#8212;with all possible prudence though, be it
observed," he added with a smile of intelligence.</p>

<p id="id04915">"Most assuredly," responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone. "As
for me, so nervous, and so subject to fainting fits, I should require
a Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and
tranquillizing my mind, in the fear I have of dying some fine day of
suffocation. In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in
France, and your abbe is not probably disposed to make a journey
to Paris on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche's
anti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman's drops are among my favorite
remedies. Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they
are compounded doubly strong." Monte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell
box, which the lady presented to him, and inhaled the odor of the
lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their
composition. "They are indeed exquisite," he said; "but as they are
necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition&#8212;a function which it
is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish&#8212;I prefer
my own specific."</p>

<p id="id04916">"Undoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have seen
produced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as to
ask it of you."</p>

<p id="id04917">"But I," said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke&#8212;"I am gallant enough to
offer it you."</p>

<p id="id04918">"How kind you are."</p>

<p id="id04919">"Only remember one thing&#8212;a small dose is a remedy, a large one is
poison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will
inevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured into
a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor.
But I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were prescribing for
you." The clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend
of Madame de Villefort, who came to dine with her.</p>

<p id="id04920">"If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time,
count, instead of only for the second," said Madame de Villefort; "if
I had had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having the
happiness of being under an obligation to you, I should insist on
detaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first
refusal."</p>

<p id="id04921">"A thousand thanks, madame," replied Monte Cristo "but I have an
engagement which I cannot break. I have promised to escort to the
Academie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your
grand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither."</p>

<p id="id04922">"Adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription."</p>

<p id="id04923">"Ah, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hour's conversation
I have had with you, which is indeed impossible." Monte Cristo bowed,
and left the house. Madame de Villefort remained immersed in thought.
"He is a very strange man," she said, "and in my opinion is himself the
Adelmonte he talks about." As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed
his utmost expectations. "Good," said he, as he went away; "this is a
fruitful soil, and I feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast
on barren ground." Next morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the
prescription requested.</p>

<h2 id="id04924" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 53. Robert le Diable.</h2>

<p id="id04925">The pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as
there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction
at the Academie Royale. Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe
illness, made his reappearance in the character of Bertrand, and, as
usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite
composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.
Morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his
orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least
a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance;
he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box.
Chateau-Renaud rented a stall beside his own, while Beauchamp, as a
journalist, had unlimited range all over the theatre. It happened that
on this particular night the minister's box was placed at the disposal
of Lucien Debray, who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf, who again,
upon his mother's rejection of it, sent it to Danglars, with an
intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the
baroness and her daughter during the evening, in the event of their
accepting the box in question. The ladies received the offer with too
much pleasure to dream of a refusal. To no class of persons is the
presentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the
wealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a
king's ransom in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p id="id04926">Danglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a
ministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his
parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not
permit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore, despatched
a note to Lucien Debray, bidding him call for them, it being wholly
impossible for her to go alone with Eugenie to the opera. There is no
gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have
been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort,
while the addition of a third, in the person of her mother's admitted
lover, enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice and ill-nature. One
must take the world as one finds it.</p>

<p id="id04927">The curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of
the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera
until after the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is
generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it,
that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in
observing the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of
opening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation. "Surely," said
Albert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened, "that must be
the Countess G&#8212;&#8212;."</p>

<p id="id04928">"And who is the Countess G&#8212;&#8212;?" inquired Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id04929">"What a question! Now, do you know, baron, I have a great mind to pick a
quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who the
Countess G&#8212;&#8212; was."</p>

<p id="id04930">"Ah, to be sure," replied Chateau-Renaud; "the lovely Venetian, is it
not?"</p>

<p id="id04931">"Herself." At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and
returned his salutation with a smile. "You know her, it seems?" said
Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id04932">"Franz introduced me to her at Rome," replied Albert.</p>

<p id="id04933">"Well, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in<br/>

Rome?"<br/></p>

<p id="id04934">"With pleasure."</p>

<p id="id04935">There was a cry of "Shut up!" from the audience. This manifestation
on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the
music, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men, who
continued their conversation. "The countess was present at the races in
the Champ-de-Mars," said Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id04936">"To-day?"</p>

<p id="id04937">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id04938">"Bless me, I quite forgot the races. Did you bet?"</p>

<p id="id04939">"Oh, merely a paltry fifty louis."</p>

<p id="id04940">"And who was the winner?"</p>

<p id="id04941">"Nautilus. I staked on him."</p>

<p id="id04942">"But there were three races, were there not?"</p>

<p id="id04943">"Yes; there was the prize given by the Jockey Club&#8212;a gold cup, you
know&#8212;and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race."</p>

<p id="id04944">"What was it?"</p>

<p id="id04945">"Oh, shut up!" again interposed some of the audience.</p>

<p id="id04946">"Why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course."</p>

<p id="id04947">"Is that possible?"</p>

<p id="id04948">"True as day. The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by the
name of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last
moment, a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist,
presented themselves at the starting-post. They were obliged to stuff at
least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider's pockets, to make
him weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare, against
whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths."</p>

<p id="id04949">"And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey
belonged?"</p>

<p id="id04950">"No."</p>

<p id="id04951">"You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa?"</p>

<p id="id04952">"Exactly; that was the title."</p>

<p id="id04953">"Then," answered Albert, "I am better informed than you are, and know
who the owner of that horse was."</p>

<p id="id04954">"Shut up, there!" cried the pit in chorus. And this time the tone and
manner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility
that the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate
was addressed to them. Leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized
the various countenances around them, as though demanding some one
person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they
deemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge,
the friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and affected
to busy themselves with the stage. At this moment the door of the
minister's box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her daughter,
entered, escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted them to
their seats.</p>

<p id="id04955">"Ha, ha," said Chateau-Renaud, "here comes some friends of yours,
viscount! What are you looking at there? don't you see they are trying
to catch your eye?" Albert turned round, just in time to receive a
gracious wave of the fan from the baroness; as for Mademoiselle Eugenie,
she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes
even upon the business of the stage. "I tell you what, my dear fellow,"
said Chateau-Renaud, "I cannot imagine what objection you can possibly
have to Mademoiselle Danglars&#8212;that is, setting aside her want of
ancestry and somewhat inferior rank, which by the way I don't think
you care very much about. Now, barring all that, I mean to say she is a
deuced fine girl!"</p>

<p id="id04956">"Handsome, certainly," replied Albert, "but not to my taste, which I
confess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more feminine."</p>

<p id="id04957">"Ah, well," exclaimed Chateau-Renaud, who because he had seen his
thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of
paternal air with his more youthful friend, "you young people are never
satisfied; why, what would you have more? your parents have chosen you
a bride built on the model of Diana, the huntress, and yet you are not
content."</p>

<p id="id04958">"No, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked
something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this
chase-loving Diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort
of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Actaeon."</p>

<p id="id04959">And, indeed, it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to
comprehend the justness of Morcerf's remark&#8212;she was beautiful, but her
beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious
taste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed somewhat
rebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were surmounted by
well-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in an almost
habitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression
of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler
attributes of her sex&#8212;her nose was precisely what a sculptor would
have chosen for a chiselled Juno. Her mouth, which might have been found
fault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered
still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips, contrasting
vividly with her naturally pale complexion. But that which completed the
almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his taste, was a dark
mole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally
are, placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the effect tended
to increase the expression of self-dependence that characterized her
countenance. The rest of Mademoiselle Eugenie's person was in perfect
keeping with the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of
Diana, as Chateau-Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and
resolute. As regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with
them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with
her beauty, that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so
young a person. She was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote
poetry, and composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to
be entirely devoted, following it with an indefatigable perseverance,
assisted by a schoolfellow,&#8212;a young woman without fortune whose talent
promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer. It was rumored
that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the
principal composers of the day, who excited her to spare no pains in the
cultivation of her voice, which might hereafter prove a source of wealth
and independence. But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle
Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one
destined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this principle, the
banker's daughter, though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise
d'Armilly (that was the name of the young virtuosa) to practice with
her through the day, took especial care not to be seen in her company.
Still, though not actually received at the Hotel Danglars in the light
of an acknowledged friend, Louise was treated with far more kindness and
consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess.</p>

<p id="id04960">The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame
Danglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed
half-hour's interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were
left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive
visits in their respective boxes. Morcerf and Chateau-Renaud were
amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission. For an instant
the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the
young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party, and she
whispered her expectations to her daughter, that Albert was hurrying to
pay his respects to them. Mademoiselle Eugenie, however, merely returned
a dissenting movement of the head, while, with a cold smile, she
directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first
circle, in which sat the Countess G&#8212;&#8212;, and where Morcerf had just made
his appearance. "So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?"
cried the countess, extending her hand to him with all the warmth and
cordiality of an old acquaintance; "it was really very good of you to
recognize me so quickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on
me."</p>

<p id="id04961">"Be assured," replied Albert, "that if I had been aware of your arrival
in Paris, and had known your address, I should have paid my respects
to you before this. Allow me to introduce my friend, Baron de
Chateau-Renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France,
and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races
in the Champ-de-Mars, yesterday." Chateau-Renaud bowed to the countess.</p>

<p id="id04962">"So you were at the races, baron?" inquired the countess eagerly.</p>

<p id="id04963">"Yes, madame."</p>

<p id="id04964">"Well, then," pursued Madame G&#8212;&#8212; with considerable animation, "you can
probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes?"</p>

<p id="id04965">"I am sorry to say I cannot," replied the baron; "and I was just asking
the same question of Albert."</p>

<p id="id04966">"Are you very anxious to know, countess?" asked Albert.</p>

<p id="id04967">"To know what?"</p>

<p id="id04968">"The name of the owner of the winning horse?"</p>

<p id="id04969">"Excessively; only imagine&#8212;but do tell me, viscount, whether you really
are acquainted with it or no?"</p>

<p id="id04970">"I beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story,
were you not? You said, 'only imagine,'&#8212;and then paused. Pray
continue."</p>

<p id="id04971">"Well, then, listen. You must know I felt so interested in the splendid
roan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in
a pink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their
success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were
at stake; and when I saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the
winning-post in such gallant style, I actually clapped my hands with
joy. Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object
I met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket! I
concluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse
must live in the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments,
I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and
rider. Inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written
these words&#8212;'From Lord Ruthven to Countess G&#8212;&#8212;.'"</p>

<p id="id04972">"Precisely; I was sure of it," said Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id04973">"Sure of what?"</p>

<p id="id04974">"That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself."</p>

<p id="id04975">"What Lord Ruthven do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id04976">"Why, our Lord Ruthven&#8212;the Vampire of the Salle Argentino!"</p>

<p id="id04977">"Is it possible?" exclaimed the countess; "is he here in Paris?"</p>

<p id="id04978">"To be sure,&#8212;why not?"</p>

<p id="id04979">"And you visit him?&#8212;meet him at your own house and elsewhere?"</p>

<p id="id04980">"I assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de Chateau-Renaud
has also the honor of his acquaintance."</p>

<p id="id04981">"But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club
prize?"</p>

<p id="id04982">"Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?"</p>

<p id="id04983">"What of that?"</p>

<p id="id04984">"Why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I
was made prisoner?"</p>

<p id="id04985">"Oh, yes."</p>

<p id="id04986">"And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner?"</p>

<p id="id04987">"To be sure, I remember it all now."</p>

<p id="id04988">"He called himself Vampa. You see, it's evident where the count got the
name."</p>

<p id="id04989">"But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?"</p>

<p id="id04990">"In the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you may
believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a countrywoman
take so lively an interest in his success."</p>

<p id="id04991">"I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish
remarks we used to make about him?"</p>

<p id="id04992">"I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not. Besides, his
presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04993">"Oh, but that is dreadful! Why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge."</p>

<p id="id04994">"Does his action appear like that of an enemy?"</p>

<p id="id04995">"No; certainly not."</p>

<p id="id04996">"Well, then"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04997">"And so he is in Paris?"</p>

<p id="id04998">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id04999">"And what effect does he produce?"</p>

<p id="id05000">"Why," said Albert, "he was talked about for a week; then the
coronation of the queen of England took place, followed by the theft of
Mademoiselle Mars's diamonds; and so people talked of something else."</p>

<p id="id05001">"My good fellow," said Chateau-Renaud, "the count is your friend and
you treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert is telling you,
countess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by
the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I take upon
myself to declare that it is as strong as ever. His first astounding
act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth
32,000 francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous
preservation of Madame de Villefort's life; now it seems that he has
carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club. I therefore maintain,
in spite of Morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest
at this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a
month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which,
after all, may be his ordinary mode of existence."</p>

<p id="id05002">"Perhaps you are right," said Morcerf; "meanwhile, who is in the Russian
ambassador's box?"</p>

<p id="id05003">"Which box do you mean?" asked the countess.</p>

<p id="id05004">"The one between the pillars on the first tier&#8212;it seems to have been
fitted up entirely afresh."</p>

<p id="id05005">"Did you observe any one during the first act?" asked Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id05006">"Where?"</p>

<p id="id05007">"In that box."</p>

<p id="id05008">"No," replied the countess, "it was certainly empty during the first
act;" then, resuming the subject of their previous conversation, she
said, "And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte
Cristo that gained the prize?"</p>

<p id="id05009">"I am sure of it."</p>

<p id="id05010">"And who afterwards sent the cup to me?"</p>

<p id="id05011">"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p id="id05012">"But I don't know him," said the countess; "I have a great mind to
return it."</p>

<p id="id05013">"Do no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another, formed
of a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby. It is
his way, and you must take him as you find him." At this moment the
bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act.
Albert rose to return to his place. "Shall I see you again?" asked the
countess. "At the end of the next act, with your permission, I will come
and inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris?"</p>

<p id="id05014">"Pray take notice," said the countess, "that my present residence is
22 Rue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday
evening. So now, you are both forewarned." The young men bowed, and
quitted the box. Upon reaching their stalls, they found the whole of the
audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards
the box formerly possessed by the Russian ambassador. A man of from
thirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in deep black, had just
entered, accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern style.
The lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the rich magnificence of her
attire drew all eyes upon her. "Hullo," said Albert; "it is Monte Cristo
and his Greek!"</p>

<p id="id05015">The strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and Haidee. In a few
moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house,
and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her
magnificent diamonds. The second act passed away during one continued
buzz of voices&#8212;one deep whisper&#8212;intimating that some great and
universally interesting event had occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were
occupied with the young and beautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and
splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle. Upon this occasion
an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated her desire to see
Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act, and
neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his
neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given. At the close of the act
he therefore went to the baroness. Having bowed to the two ladies, he
extended his hand to Debray. By the baroness he was most graciously
welcomed, while Eugenie received him with her accustomed coldness.</p>

<p id="id05016">"My dear fellow," said Debray, "you have come in the nick of time.
There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count; she
insists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education, and parentage,
where he came from, and whither he is going. Being no disciple of
Cagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of getting out
of the scrape, I said, 'Ask Morcerf; he has got the whole history of
his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers' ends;' whereupon the baroness
signified her desire to see you."</p>

<p id="id05017">"Is it not almost incredible," said Madame Danglars, "that a person
having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command,
should possess so little information?"</p>

<p id="id05018">"Let me assure you, madame," said Lucien, "that had I really the sum
you mention at my disposal, I would employ it more profitably than in
troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte
Cristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich
as a nabob. However, I have turned the business over to Morcerf, so pray
settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own part, I
care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings."</p>

<p id="id05019">"I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth
32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000
francs each."</p>

<p id="id05020">"He seems to have a mania for diamonds," said Morcerf, smiling, "and I
verily believe that, like Potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for
the sake of strewing them along the road, as Tom Thumb did his flint
stones."</p>

<p id="id05021">"Perhaps he has discovered some mine," said Madame Danglars. "I suppose
you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron's banking
establishment?"</p>

<p id="id05022">"I was not aware of it," replied Albert, "but I can readily believe it."</p>

<p id="id05023">"And, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only
staying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six
millions.</p>

<p id="id05024">"He must be the Shah of Persia, travelling incog."</p>

<p id="id05025">"Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M. Lucien?"
inquired Eugenie.</p>

<p id="id05026">"I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms
of another as yourself," responded Lucien, raising his lorgnette to his
eye. "A most lovely creature, upon my soul!" was his verdict.</p>

<p id="id05027">"Who is this young person, M. de Morcerf?" inquired Eugenie; "does
anybody know?"</p>

<p id="id05028">"Mademoiselle," said Albert, replying to this direct appeal, "I can give
you very exact information on that subject, as well as on most points
relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing&#8212;the
young woman is a Greek."</p>

<p id="id05029">"So I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that, every
one here is as well-informed as yourself."</p>

<p id="id05030">"I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone," replied
Morcerf, "but I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have nothing
further to communicate&#8212;yes, stay, I do know one thing more, namely,
that she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting
with the count, I heard the sound of a guzla&#8212;it is impossible that it
could have been touched by any other finger than her own."</p>

<p id="id05031">"Then your count entertains visitors, does he?" asked Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id05032">"Indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you."</p>

<p id="id05033">"I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner,
or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in return."</p>

<p id="id05034">"What," said Debray, laughing; "do you really mean you would go to his
house?"</p>

<p id="id05035">"Why not? my husband could accompany me."</p>

<p id="id05036">"But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?"</p>

<p id="id05037">"You have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite," said the
baroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek.</p>

<p id="id05038">"No, no!" exclaimed Debray; "that girl is not his wife: he told us
himself she was his slave. Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his telling us
so at your breakfast?"</p>

<p id="id05039">"Well, then," said the baroness, "if slave she be, she has all the air
and manner of a princess."</p>

<p id="id05040">"Of the 'Arabian Nights'?"</p>

<p id="id05041">"If you like; but tell me, my dear Lucien, what it is that constitutes a
princess. Why, diamonds&#8212;and she is covered with them."</p>

<p id="id05042">"To me she seems overloaded," observed Eugenie; "she would look far
better if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely
formed throat and wrists."</p>

<p id="id05043">"See how the artist peeps out!" exclaimed Madame Danglars. "My poor<br/>

Eugenie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts."<br/></p>

<p id="id05044">"I admire all that is beautiful," returned the young lady.</p>

<p id="id05045">"What do you think of the count?" inquired Debray; "he is not much
amiss, according to my ideas of good looks."</p>

<p id="id05046">"The count," repeated Eugenie, as though it had not occurred to her to
observe him sooner; "the count?&#8212;oh, he is so dreadfully pale."</p>

<p id="id05047">"I quite agree with you," said Morcerf; "and the secret of that very
pallor is what we want to find out. The Countess G&#8212;&#8212; insists upon it
that he is a vampire."</p>

<p id="id05048">"Then the Countess G&#8212;&#8212; has returned to Paris, has she?" inquired the
baroness.</p>

<p id="id05049">"Is that she, mamma?" asked Eugenie; "almost opposite to us, with that
profusion of beautiful light hair?"</p>

<p id="id05050">"Yes," said Madame Danglars, "that is she. Shall I tell you what you
ought to do, Morcerf?"</p>

<p id="id05051">"Command me, madame."</p>

<p id="id05052">"Well, then, you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us."</p>

<p id="id05053">"What for?" asked Eugenie.</p>

<p id="id05054">"What for? Why, to converse with him, of course. Have you really no
desire to meet him?"</p>

<p id="id05055">"None whatever," replied Eugenie.</p>

<p id="id05056">"Strange child," murmured the baroness.</p>

<p id="id05057">"He will very probably come of his own accord," said Morcerf. "There; do
you see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows." The baroness returned the
salute in the most smiling and graceful manner.</p>

<p id="id05058">"Well," said Morcerf, "I may as well be magnanimous, and tear myself
away to forward your wishes. Adieu; I will go and try if there are any
means of speaking to him."</p>

<p id="id05059">"Go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan."</p>

<p id="id05060">"But I have never been presented."</p>

<p id="id05061">"Presented to whom?"</p>

<p id="id05062">"To the beautiful Greek."</p>

<p id="id05063">"You say she is only a slave?"</p>

<p id="id05064">"While you assert that she is a queen, or at least a princess. No; I
hope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out."</p>

<p id="id05065">"That is possible&#8212;go."</p>

<p id="id05066">"I am going," said Albert, as he made his parting bow. Just as he was
passing the count's box, the door opened, and Monte Cristo came forth.
After giving some directions to Ali, who stood in the lobby, the count
took Albert's arm. Carefully closing the box door, Ali placed himself
before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nubian.</p>

<p id="id05067">"Upon my word," said Monte Cristo, "Paris is a strange city, and the
Parisians a very singular people. See that cluster of persons collected
around poor Ali, who is as much astonished as themselves; really one
might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld. Now I can
promise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in public, either in
Tunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being treated in that
way."</p>

<p id="id05068">"That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste
their time and attention on objects undeserving of either. However, as
far as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is
merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant&#8212;you, who are
at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris."</p>

<p id="id05069">"Really? and what has procured me so fluttering a distinction?"</p>

<p id="id05070">"What? why, yourself, to be sure! You give away horses worth a thousand
louis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the
name of Major Brack you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not
larger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy
of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first
handsome woman you think of!"</p>

<p id="id05071">"And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?"</p>

<p id="id05072">"Why, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by the
by, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by others;
secondly, I learned it from Beauchamp's journal; and thirdly, from my
own imagination. Why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse
Vampa?"</p>

<p id="id05073">"That was an oversight, certainly," replied the count; "but tell me,
does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera? I have been looking for
him, but without success."</p>

<p id="id05074">"He will be here to-night."</p>

<p id="id05075">"In what part of the house?"</p>

<p id="id05076">"In the baroness's box, I believe."</p>

<p id="id05077">"That charming young woman with her is her daughter?"</p>

<p id="id05078">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05079">"I congratulate you." Morcerf smiled. "We will discuss that subject at
length some future time," said he. "But what do you think of the music?"</p>

<p id="id05080">"What music?"</p>

<p id="id05081">"Why, the music you have been listening to."</p>

<p id="id05082">"Oh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung by
featherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes."</p>

<p id="id05083">"From which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure enjoy
the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise?"</p>

<p id="id05084">"You are right, in some degree; when I wish to listen to sounds more
exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to, I go
to sleep."</p>

<p id="id05085">"Then sleep here, my dear count. The conditions are favorable; what else
was opera invented for?"</p>

<p id="id05086">"No, thank you. Your orchestra is too noisy. To sleep after the manner
I speak of, absolute calm and silence are necessary, and then a certain
preparation"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05087">"I know&#8212;the famous hashish!"</p>

<p id="id05088">"Precisely. So, my dear viscount, whenever you wish to be regaled with
music come and sup with me."</p>

<p id="id05089">"I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you," said<br/>

Morcerf.<br/></p>

<p id="id05090">"Do you mean at Rome?"</p>

<p id="id05091">"I do."</p>

<p id="id05092">"Ah, then, I suppose you heard Haidee's guzla; the poor exile frequently
beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native
land." Morcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo himself fell
into a silent reverie. The bell rang at this moment for the rising of
the curtain. "You will excuse my leaving you," said the count, turning
in the direction of his box.</p>

<p id="id05093">"What? Are you going?"</p>

<p id="id05094">"Pray, say everything that is kind to Countess G&#8212;&#8212; on the part of her
friend the Vampire."</p>

<p id="id05095">"And what message shall I convey to the baroness!"</p>

<p id="id05096">"That, with her permission, I shall do myself the honor of paying my
respects in the course of the evening."</p>

<p id="id05097">The third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf,
according to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame
Danglars. The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either
interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence,
therefore, was wholly unnoticed, save by the occupants of the box in
which he had just seated himself. The quick eye of Monte Cristo however,
marked his coming; and a slight though meaning smile passed over his
lips. Haidee, whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage,
like all unsophisticated natures, delighted in whatever addressed itself
to the eye or ear.</p>

<p id="id05098">The third act passed off as usual. Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julie, and
Leroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the
Prince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella, taking
his daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic strides,
the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle.
After which the curtain again fell, and the spectators poured forth from
the theatre into the lobbies and salon. The count left his box, and a
moment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars, who could not restrain
a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise. "You are welcome, count!" she
exclaimed, as he entered. "I have been most anxious to see you, that I
might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express."</p>

<p id="id05099">"Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your
remembrance. Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it."</p>

<p id="id05100">"But it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day
after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame
de Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity
restored to me."</p>

<p id="id05101">"This time, at least, I do not deserve your thanks. It was Ali, my<br/>

Nubian slave, who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort."<br/></p>

<p id="id05102">"Was it Ali," asked the Count of Morcerf, "who rescued my son from the
hands of bandits?"</p>

<p id="id05103">"No, count," replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the
general; "in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks;
but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your debt&#8212;if
indeed there existed one&#8212;and I feel almost mortified to find you still
reverting to the subject. May I beg of you, baroness, to honor me with
an introduction to your daughter?"</p>

<p id="id05104">"Oh, you are no stranger&#8212;at least not by name," replied Madame
Danglars, "and the last two or three days we have really talked of
nothing but you. Eugenie," continued the baroness, turning towards her
daughter, "this is the Count of Monte Cristo." The Count bowed, while
Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly. "You have a charming young
person with you to-night, count," said Eugenie. "Is she your daughter?"</p>

<p id="id05105">"No, mademoiselle," said Monte Cristo, astonished at the coolness and
freedom of the question. "She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my
care."</p>

<p id="id05106">"And what is her name?"</p>

<p id="id05107">"Haidee," replied Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05108">"A Greek?" murmured the Count of Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id05109">"Yes, indeed, count," said Madame Danglars; "and tell me, did you ever
see at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly
served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?"</p>

<p id="id05110">"Did I hear rightly, monsieur," said Monte Cristo "that you served at<br/>

Yanina?"<br/></p>

<p id="id05111">"I was inspector-general of the pasha's troops," replied Morcerf; "and
it is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality
of the illustrious Albanese chief."</p>

<p id="id05112">"But look!" exclaimed Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id05113">"Where?" stammered Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id05114">"There," said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count, and
leaning with him over the front of the box, just as Haidee, whose
eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian,
perceived his pale features close to Morcerf's face. It was as if the
young girl beheld the head of Medusa. She bent forwards as though to
assure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint
cry, threw herself back in her seat. The sound was heard by the people
about Ali, who instantly opened the box-door. "Why, count," exclaimed
Eugenie, "what has happened to your ward? she seems to have been taken
suddenly ill."</p>

<p id="id05115">"Very probably," answered the count. "But do not be alarmed on her
account. Haidee's nervous system is delicately organized, and she is
peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers&#8212;nay, there are
some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence. However,"
continued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, "I have
an infallible remedy." So saying, he bowed to the baroness and her
daughter, exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the
count, and left Madame Danglars' box. Upon his return to Haidee he found
her still very pale. As soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own
hands were moist and icy cold. "Who was it you were talking with over
there?" she asked.</p>

<p id="id05116">"With the Count of Morcerf," answered Monte Cristo. "He tells me he
served your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him."</p>

<p id="id05117">"Wretch!" exclaimed Haidee, her eyes flashing with rage; "he sold my
father to the Turks, and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his
treachery! Did not you know that, my dear lord?"</p>

<p id="id05118">"Something of this I heard in Epirus," said Monte Cristo; "but the
particulars are still unknown to me. You shall relate them to me, my
child. They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting."</p>

<p id="id05119">"Yes, yes; but let us go. I feel as though it would kill me to remain
long near that dreadful man." So saying, Haidee arose, and wrapping
herself in her burnoose of white cashmire embroidered with pearls and
coral, she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was
rising upon the fourth act.</p>

<p id="id05120">"Do you observe," said the Countess G&#8212;&#8212; to Albert, who had returned
to her side, "that man does nothing like other people; he listens most
devoutly to the third act of 'Robert le Diable,' and when the fourth
begins, takes his departure."</p>
