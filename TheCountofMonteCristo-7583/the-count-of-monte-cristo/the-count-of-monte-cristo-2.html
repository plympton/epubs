<h2 id="id00663" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 7. The Examination.</h2>

<p id="id00664">No sooner had Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air
of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in
spite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a
finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by
no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the
recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which
might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his
own career, Gerard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already
rich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven.
He was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not
passionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the
king; and besides her personal attractions, which were very great,
Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran's family possessed considerable political
influence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry
of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides,
the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her
father's death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling
of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its
contemplation.</p>

<p id="id00665">At the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him.
The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to
earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, "I
have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting
this man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the
conspiracy."</p>

<p id="id00666">"We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers
found have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself
is named Edmond Dantes, mate on board the three-master the Pharaon,
trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel &amp;
Son, of Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id00667">"Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the
marines?"</p>

<p id="id00668">"Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young."</p>

<p id="id00669">"How old?"</p>

<p id="id00670">"Nineteen or twenty at the most."</p>

<p id="id00671">At this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the
Rue des Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him,
approached; it was M. Morrel.</p>

<p id="id00672">"Ah, M. de Villefort," cried he, "I am delighted to see you. Some
of your people have committed the strangest mistake&#8212;they have just
arrested Edmond Dantes, mate of my vessel."</p>

<p id="id00673">"I know it, monsieur," replied Villefort, "and I am now going to examine
him."</p>

<p id="id00674">"Oh," said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, "you do not know him,
and I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the
world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all
the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for
him."</p>

<p id="id00675">Villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at
Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other
suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and
replied,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00676">"You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in
private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be,
politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?"</p>

<p id="id00677">The magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply
them to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into
the heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of
indulgence. Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear
on politics; besides, what Dantes had told him of his interview with the
grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him. He
replied, however,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00678">"I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and
equitable, and give him back to us soon." This give us sounded
revolutionary in the deputy's ears.</p>

<p id="id00679">"Ah, ah," murmured he, "is Dantes then a member of some Carbonari
society, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He was, if
I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others."
Then he added, "Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform my duty
impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed
to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch,
impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my duty."</p>

<p id="id00680">As he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined
the Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the
shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had
left him. The ante-chamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in
the midst of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the
prisoner. Villefort traversed the ante-chamber, cast a side glance at
Dantes, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared,
saying, "Bring in the prisoner."</p>

<p id="id00681">Rapid as had been Villefort's glance, it had served to give him an idea
of the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized intelligence
in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and
frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.
Villefort's first impression was favorable; but he had been so often
warned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the
impression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He stifled,
therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his
features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An instant after
Dantes entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his
judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been
in M. Morrel's salon. It was then that he encountered for the first
time Villefort's look,&#8212;that look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while
seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own.</p>

<p id="id00682">"Who and what are you?" demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of
papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police
agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour's
time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt
espionage of which "the accused" is always made the victim.</p>

<p id="id00683">"My name is Edmond Dantes," replied the young man calmly; "I am mate of
the Pharaon, belonging to Messrs. Morrel &amp; Son."</p>

<p id="id00684">"Your age?" continued Villefort.</p>

<p id="id00685">"Nineteen," returned Dantes.</p>

<p id="id00686">"What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?"</p>

<p id="id00687">"I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur," said the young man,
his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that
happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great
was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the
radiant face of Mercedes.</p>

<p id="id00688">"You were at the festival of your marriage?" said the deputy, shuddering
in spite of himself.</p>

<p id="id00689">"Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been
attached to for three years." Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck
with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantes, surprised
in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own
bosom&#8212;he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned
from his own happiness to destroy that of another. "This philosophic
reflection," thought he, "will make a great sensation at M. de
Saint-Meran's;" and he arranged mentally, while Dantes awaited further
questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for
eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dantes.</p>

<p id="id00690">"Go on, sir," said he.</p>

<p id="id00691">"What would you have me say?"</p>

<p id="id00692">"Give all the information in your power."</p>

<p id="id00693">"Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I
know; only," added he, with a smile, "I warn you I know very little."</p>

<p id="id00694">"Have you served under the usurper?"</p>

<p id="id00695">"I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell."</p>

<p id="id00696">"It is reported your political opinions are extreme," said Villefort,
who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this
inquiry, as if it were an accusation.</p>

<p id="id00697">"My political opinions!" replied Dantes. "Alas, sir, I never had any
opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.
If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus
all my opinions&#8212;I will not say public, but private&#8212;are confined to
these three sentiments,&#8212;I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and
I adore Mercedes. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how
uninteresting it is." As Dantes spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous
and open countenance, and recollected the words of Renee, who, without
knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With
the deputy's knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man
uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he
was scarcely a man,&#8212;simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of
the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,
because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked
good&#8212;extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort's
severe look and stern accent. Dantes seemed full of kindness.</p>

<p id="id00698">"Pardieu," said Villefort, "he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain
Renee's favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on
me. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet
kiss in private." Full of this idea, Villefort's face became so joyous,
that when he turned to Dantes, the latter, who had watched the change on
his physiognomy, was smiling also.</p>

<p id="id00699">"Sir," said Villefort, "have you any enemies, at least, that you know."</p>

<p id="id00700">"I have enemies?" replied Dantes; "my position is not sufficiently
elevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat
too hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve
sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that
they love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as an
elder brother."</p>

<p id="id00701">"But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at
nineteen&#8212;an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who
loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the
envy of some one."</p>

<p id="id00702">"You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may
possibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my
acquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced
to hate them."</p>

<p id="id00703">"You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You
seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty
to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the
paper; do you know the writing?" As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter
from his pocket, and presented it to Dantes. Dantes read it. A cloud
passed over his brow as he said,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00704">"No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably plain.
Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate," added he, looking
gratefully at Villefort, "to be examined by such a man as you; for this
envious person is a real enemy." And by the rapid glance that the young
man's eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath
this mildness.</p>

<p id="id00705">"Now," said the deputy, "answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a
judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what
truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?"
And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantes had just
given back to him.</p>

<p id="id00706">"None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a
sailor, by my love for Mercedes, by the life of my father"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00707">"Speak, monsieur," said Villefort. Then, internally, "If Renee could
see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a
decapitator."</p>

<p id="id00708">"Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain
fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive at
Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to
such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying,
he called me to him. 'My dear Dantes,' said he, 'swear to perform what I
am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.'</p>

<p id="id00709">"'I swear, captain,' replied I.</p>

<p id="id00710">"'Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate,
assume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at
Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter&#8212;perhaps
they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You
will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and
profit from it.'</p>

<p id="id00711">"'I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the
grand marshal's presence as easily as you expect?'</p>

<p id="id00712">"'Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every
difficulty,' said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was
time&#8212;two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died."</p>

<p id="id00713">"And what did you do then?"</p>

<p id="id00714">"What I ought to have done, and what every one would have done in my
place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with
a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for
the Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody
to remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found
some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the
ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted.
He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere's death; and, as the latter
had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I
undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed
here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my
affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M.
Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you,
at my marriage-feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and
to-morrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this
charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust."</p>

<p id="id00715">"Ah," said Villefort, "this seems to me the truth. If you have been
culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to the
orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from Elba,
and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go and
rejoin your friends.</p>

<p id="id00716">"I am free, then, sir?" cried Dantes joyfully.</p>

<p id="id00717">"Yes; but first give me this letter."</p>

<p id="id00718">"You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I
see in that packet."</p>

<p id="id00719">"Stop a moment," said the deputy, as Dantes took his hat and gloves. "To
whom is it addressed?"</p>

<p id="id00720">"To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Heron, Paris." Had a thunderbolt fallen
into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He sank
into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the fatal
letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.</p>

<p id="id00721">"M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Heron, No. 13," murmured he, growing still paler.</p>

<p id="id00722">"Yes," said Dantes; "do you know him?"</p>

<p id="id00723">"No," replied Villefort; "a faithful servant of the king does not know
conspirators."</p>

<p id="id00724">"It is a conspiracy, then?" asked Dantes, who after believing himself
free, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. "I have, however, already told
you, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter."</p>

<p id="id00725">"Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,"
said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id00726">"I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it."</p>

<p id="id00727">"Have you shown this letter to any one?" asked Villefort, becoming still
more pale.</p>

<p id="id00728">"To no one, on my honor."</p>

<p id="id00729">"Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the<br/>

Island of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?"<br/></p>

<p id="id00730">"Everybody, except the person who gave it to me."</p>

<p id="id00731">"And that was too much, far too much," murmured Villefort. Villefort's
brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clinched teeth filled
Dantes with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered
his face with his hands.</p>

<p id="id00732">"Oh," said Dantes timidly, "what is the matter?" Villefort made no
answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and
again perused the letter.</p>

<p id="id00733">"And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?"</p>

<p id="id00734">"I give you my word of honor, sir," said Dantes; "but what is the
matter? You are ill&#8212;shall I ring for assistance?&#8212;shall I call?"</p>

<p id="id00735">"No," said Villefort, rising hastily; "stay where you are. It is for me
to give orders here, and not you."</p>

<p id="id00736">"Monsieur," replied Dantes proudly, "it was only to summon assistance
for you."</p>

<p id="id00737">"I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;
answer me." Dantes waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort
fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with
perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.</p>

<p id="id00738">"Oh, if he knows the contents of this!" murmured he, "and that Noirtier
is the father of Villefort, I am lost!" And he fixed his eyes upon
Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.</p>

<p id="id00739">"Oh, it is impossible to doubt it," cried he, suddenly.</p>

<p id="id00740">"In heaven's name!" cried the unhappy young man, "if you doubt me,
question me; I will answer you." Villefort made a violent effort, and in
a tone he strove to render firm,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00741">"Sir," said he, "I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you
immediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial
justice; what my own feeling is you already know."</p>

<p id="id00742">"Oh, monsieur," cried Dantes, "you have been rather a friend than a
judge."</p>

<p id="id00743">"Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it
as short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,
and you see"&#8212;Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited
until it was entirely consumed.</p>

<p id="id00744">"You see, I destroy it?"</p>

<p id="id00745">"Oh," exclaimed Dantes, "you are goodness itself."</p>

<p id="id00746">"Listen," continued Villefort; "you can now have confidence in me after
what I have done."</p>

<p id="id00747">"Oh, command, and I will obey."</p>

<p id="id00748">"Listen; this is not a command, but advice I give you."</p>

<p id="id00749">"Speak, and I will follow your advice."</p>

<p id="id00750">"I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice. Should
any one else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but
do not breathe a word of this letter."</p>

<p id="id00751">"I promise." It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner
who reassured him.</p>

<p id="id00752">"You see," continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of
burnt paper fluttered in the flames, "the letter is destroyed; you and I
alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned, deny
all knowledge of it&#8212;deny it boldly, and you are saved."</p>

<p id="id00753">"Be satisfied; I will deny it."</p>

<p id="id00754">"It was the only letter you had?"</p>

<p id="id00755">"It was."</p>

<p id="id00756">"Swear it."</p>

<p id="id00757">"I swear it."</p>

<p id="id00758">Villefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words
in his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.</p>

<p id="id00759">"Follow him," said Villefort to Dantes. Dantes saluted Villefort
and retired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself
half-fainting into a chair.</p>

<p id="id00760">"Alas, alas," murmured he, "if the procureur himself had been at
Marseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have
destroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always
interfere with my successes?" Suddenly a light passed over his face,
a smile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in
thought.</p>

<p id="id00761">"This will do," said he, "and from this letter, which might have ruined
me, I will make my fortune. Now to the work I have in hand." And after
having assured himself that the prisoner was gone, the deputy procureur
hastened to the house of his betrothed.</p>

<h2 id="id00762" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 8. The Chateau D'If.</h2>

<p id="id00763">The commissary of police, as he traversed the ante-chamber, made a sign
to two gendarmes, who placed themselves one on Dantes' right and the
other on his left. A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice
was opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors,
whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder. The Palais de
Justice communicated with the prison,&#8212;a sombre edifice, that from
its grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After
numberless windings, Dantes saw a door with an iron wicket. The
commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow seeming
to Dantes as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two gendarmes
gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud sound behind
him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and mephitic,&#8212;he
was in prison. He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated
and barred, and its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him;
besides, the words of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so
much, resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four
o'clock when Dantes was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said,
the 1st of March, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The
obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound
he rose and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate
him, but the sound died away, and Dantes sank again into his seat. At
last, about ten o'clock, and just as Dantes began to despair, steps were
heard in the corridor, a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked,
the massy oaken door flew open, and a flood of light from two torches
pervaded the apartment. By the torchlight Dantes saw the glittering
sabres and carbines of four gendarmes. He had advanced at first, but
stopped at the sight of this display of force.</p>

<p id="id00764">"Are you come to fetch me?" asked he.</p>

<p id="id00765">"Yes," replied a gendarme.</p>

<p id="id00766">"By the orders of the deputy procureur?"</p>

<p id="id00767">"I believe so." The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort
relieved all Dantes' apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed
himself in the centre of the escort. A carriage waited at the door, the
coachman was on the box, and a police officer sat beside him.</p>

<p id="id00768">"Is this carriage for me?" said Dantes.</p>

<p id="id00769">"It is for you," replied a gendarme.</p>

<p id="id00770">Dantes was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and having
neither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the steps, and
was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the two others
took their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily over the
stones.</p>

<p id="id00771">The prisoner glanced at the windows&#8212;they were grated; he had changed
his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither.
Through the grating, however, Dantes saw they were passing through the
Rue Caisserie, and by the Rue Saint-Laurent and the Rue Taramis, to the
port. Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne.</p>

<p id="id00772">The carriage stopped, the officer descended, approached the guardhouse,
a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; Dantes saw the
reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay.</p>

<p id="id00773">"Can all this force be summoned on my account?" thought he.</p>

<p id="id00774">The officer opened the door, which was locked, and, without speaking
a word, answered Dantes' question; for he saw between the ranks of
the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port. The two
gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered
to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example.
They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a
chain, near the quay.</p>

<p id="id00775">The soldiers looked at Dantes with an air of stupid curiosity. In an
instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the
gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent
the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the
Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of
the port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dantes knew, in the
Frioul and outside the inner harbor.</p>

<p id="id00776">The prisoner's first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure
air&#8212;for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La
Reserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the
open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. Dantes folded his
hands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.</p>

<p id="id00777">The boat continued her voyage. They had passed the Tete de Morte,
were now off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. This
manoeuvre was incomprehensible to Dantes.</p>

<p id="id00778">"Whither are you taking me?" asked he.</p>

<p id="id00779">"You will soon know."</p>

<p id="id00780">"But still"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00781">"We are forbidden to give you any explanation." Dantes, trained in
discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question
subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.</p>

<p id="id00782">The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they
were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor
outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on
some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to
handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy,
who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce
the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? Had not
Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof
against him?</p>

<p id="id00783">He waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.</p>

<p id="id00784">They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the
right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the
prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it
was there Mercedes dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn
Mercedes that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?</p>

<p id="id00785">One light alone was visible; and Dantes saw that it came from Mercedes'
chamber. Mercedes was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A loud
cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not utter
it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?</p>

<p id="id00786">He remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but
the prisoner thought only of Mercedes. An intervening elevation of land
hid the light. Dantes turned and perceived that they had got out to sea.
While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their oars and
hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.</p>

<p id="id00787">In spite of his repugnance to address the guards, Dantes turned to the
nearest gendarme, and taking his hand,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00788">"Comrade," said he, "I adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to tell
me where we are going. I am Captain Dantes, a loyal Frenchman, thought
accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me, and I promise
you on my honor I will submit to my fate."</p>

<p id="id00789">The gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for
answer a sign that said, "I see no great harm in telling him now," and
the gendarme replied,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00790">"You are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know
where you are going?"</p>

<p id="id00791">"On my honor, I have no idea."</p>

<p id="id00792">"Have you no idea whatever?"</p>

<p id="id00793">"None at all."</p>

<p id="id00794">"That is impossible."</p>

<p id="id00795">"I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I entreat."</p>

<p id="id00796">"But my orders."</p>

<p id="id00797">"Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten
minutes, in half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even if I
intended."</p>

<p id="id00798">"Unless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you must
know."</p>

<p id="id00799">"I do not."</p>

<p id="id00800">"Look round you then." Dantes rose and looked forward, when he saw
rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which
stands the Chateau d'If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than
three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends, seemed to
Dantes like a scaffold to a malefactor.</p>

<p id="id00801">"The Chateau d'If?" cried he, "what are we going there for?" The
gendarme smiled.</p>

<p id="id00802">"I am not going there to be imprisoned," said Dantes; "it is only
used for political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are there any
magistrates or judges at the Chateau d'If?"</p>

<p id="id00803">"There are only," said the gendarme, "a governor, a garrison, turnkeys,
and good thick walls. Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you
will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature."
Dantes pressed the gendarme's hand as though he would crush it.</p>

<p id="id00804">"You think, then," said he, "that I am taken to the Chateau d'If to be
imprisoned there?"</p>

<p id="id00805">"It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard."</p>

<p id="id00806">"Without any inquiry, without any formality?"</p>

<p id="id00807">"All the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already
made."</p>

<p id="id00808">"And so, in spite of M. de Villefort's promises?"</p>

<p id="id00809">"I do not know what M. de Villefort promised you," said the gendarme,
"but I know we are taking you to the Chateau d'If. But what are you
doing? Help, comrades, help!"</p>

<p id="id00810">By a rapid movement, which the gendarme's practiced eye had perceived,
Dantes sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four
vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat. He
fell back cursing with rage.</p>

<p id="id00811">"Good!" said the gendarme, placing his knee on his chest; "believe
soft-spoken gentlemen again! Harkye, my friend, I have disobeyed my
first order, but I will not disobey the second; and if you move, I will
blow your brains out." And he levelled his carbine at Dantes, who felt
the muzzle against his temple.</p>

<p id="id00812">For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending
the unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he bethought him of M.
de Villefort's promise; and, besides, death in a boat from the hand of
a gendarme seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but gnashing his
teeth and wringing his hands with fury.</p>

<p id="id00813">At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock. One of
the sailors leaped on shore, a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley,
and Dantes guessed they were at the end of the voyage, and that they
were mooring the boat.</p>

<p id="id00814">His guards, taking him by the arms and coat-collar, forced him to rise,
and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress,
while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed
behind.</p>

<p id="id00815">Dantes made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream: he saw soldiers
drawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a
flight of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a door, and
that the door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as through
a mist. He did not even see the ocean, that terrible barrier against
freedom, which the prisoners look upon with utter despair.</p>

<p id="id00816">They halted for a minute, during which he strove to collect his
thoughts. He looked around; he was in a court surrounded by high walls;
he heard the measured tread of sentinels, and as they passed before the
light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine.</p>

<p id="id00817">They waited upwards of ten minutes. Certain Dantes could not escape, the
gendarmes released him. They seemed awaiting orders. The orders came.</p>

<p id="id00818">"Where is the prisoner?" said a voice.</p>

<p id="id00819">"Here," replied the gendarmes.</p>

<p id="id00820">"Let him follow me; I will take him to his cell."</p>

<p id="id00821">"Go!" said the gendarmes, thrusting Dantes forward.</p>

<p id="id00822">The prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under
ground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with
tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly,
and showed Dantes the features of his conductor, an under-jailer,
ill-clothed, and of sullen appearance.</p>

<p id="id00823">"Here is your chamber for to-night," said he. "It is late, and the
governor is asleep. To-morrow, perhaps, he may change you. In the
meantime there is bread, water, and fresh straw; and that is all a
prisoner can wish for. Goodnight." And before Dantes could open his
mouth&#8212;before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the
water&#8212;before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was,
the jailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door,
leaving stamped upon the prisoner's mind the dim reflection of the
dripping walls of his dungeon.</p>

<p id="id00824">Dantes was alone in darkness and in silence&#8212;cold as the shadows that
he felt breathe on his burning forehead. With the first dawn of day the
jailer returned, with orders to leave Dantes where he was. He found the
prisoner in the same position, as if fixed there, his eyes swollen with
weeping. He had passed the night standing, and without sleep. The jailer
advanced; Dantes appeared not to perceive him. He touched him on the
shoulder. Edmond started.</p>

<p id="id00825">"Have you not slept?" said the jailer.</p>

<p id="id00826">"I do not know," replied Dantes. The jailer stared.</p>

<p id="id00827">"Are you hungry?" continued he.</p>

<p id="id00828">"I do not know."</p>

<p id="id00829">"Do you wish for anything?"</p>

<p id="id00830">"I wish to see the governor." The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left
the chamber.</p>

<p id="id00831">Dantes followed him with his eyes, and stretched forth his hands towards
the open door; but the door closed. All his emotion then burst forth;
he cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking himself what
crime he had committed that he was thus punished.</p>

<p id="id00832">The day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and
round the cell like a wild beast in its cage. One thought in particular
tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so
still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and,
thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained
the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish
vessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where Mercedes and his father could
have joined him. He had no fears as to how he should live&#8212;good seamen
are welcome everywhere. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish like
a Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with Mercedes and
his father, whereas he was now confined in the Chateau d'If, that
impregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and
Mercedes; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort's promise.
The thought was maddening, and Dantes threw himself furiously down on
his straw. The next morning at the same hour, the jailer came again.</p>

<p id="id00833">"Well," said the jailer, "are you more reasonable to-day?" Dantes made
no reply.</p>

<p id="id00834">"Come, cheer up; is there anything that I can do for you?"</p>

<p id="id00835">"I wish to see the governor."</p>

<p id="id00836">"I have already told you it was impossible."</p>

<p id="id00837">"Why so?"</p>

<p id="id00838">"Because it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask for
it."</p>

<p id="id00839">"What is allowed, then?"</p>

<p id="id00840">"Better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about."</p>

<p id="id00841">"I do not want books, I am satisfied with my food, and do not care to
walk about; but I wish to see the governor."</p>

<p id="id00842">"If you worry me by repeating the same thing, I will not bring you any
more to eat."</p>

<p id="id00843">"Well, then," said Edmond, "if you do not, I shall die of hunger&#8212;that
is all."</p>

<p id="id00844">The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every
prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more
subdued tone.</p>

<p id="id00845">"What you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you will
be allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor, and
if he chooses to reply, that is his affair."</p>

<p id="id00846">"But," asked Dantes, "how long shall I have to wait?"</p>

<p id="id00847">"Ah, a month&#8212;six months&#8212;a year."</p>

<p id="id00848">"It is too long a time. I wish to see him at once."</p>

<p id="id00849">"Ah," said the jailer, "do not always brood over what is impossible, or
you will be mad in a fortnight."</p>

<p id="id00850">"You think so?"</p>

<p id="id00851">"Yes; we have an instance here; it was by always offering a million of
francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbe became mad, who was
in this chamber before you."</p>

<p id="id00852">"How long has he left it?"</p>

<p id="id00853">"Two years."</p>

<p id="id00854">"Was he liberated, then?"</p>

<p id="id00855">"No; he was put in a dungeon."</p>

<p id="id00856">"Listen!" said Dantes. "I am not an abbe, I am not mad; perhaps I shall
be, but at present, unfortunately, I am not. I will make you another
offer."</p>

<p id="id00857">"What is that?"</p>

<p id="id00858">"I do not offer you a million, because I have it not; but I will give
you a hundred crowns if, the first time you go to Marseilles, you will
seek out a young girl named Mercedes, at the Catalans, and give her two
lines from me."</p>

<p id="id00859">"If I took them, and were detected, I should lose my place, which is
worth two thousand francs a year; so that I should be a great fool to
run such a risk for three hundred."</p>

<p id="id00860">"Well," said Dantes, "mark this; if you refuse at least to tell Mercedes
I am here, I will some day hide myself behind the door, and when you
enter I will dash out your brains with this stool."</p>

<p id="id00861">"Threats!" cried the jailer, retreating and putting himself on the
defensive; "you are certainly going mad. The abbe began like you, and in
three days you will be like him, mad enough to tie up; but, fortunately,
there are dungeons here." Dantes whirled the stool round his head.</p>

<p id="id00862">"All right, all right," said the jailer; "all right, since you will have
it so. I will send word to the governor."</p>

<p id="id00863">"Very well," returned Dantes, dropping the stool and sitting on it as if
he were in reality mad. The jailer went out, and returned in an instant
with a corporal and four soldiers.</p>

<p id="id00864">"By the governor's orders," said he, "conduct the prisoner to the tier
beneath."</p>

<p id="id00865">"To the dungeon, then," said the corporal.</p>

<p id="id00866">"Yes; we must put the madman with the madmen." The soldiers seized<br/>

Dantes, who followed passively.<br/></p>

<p id="id00867">He descended fifteen steps, and the door of a dungeon was opened, and
he was thrust in. The door closed, and Dantes advanced with outstretched
hands until he touched the wall; he then sat down in the corner until
his eyes became accustomed to the darkness. The jailer was right; Dantes
wanted but little of being utterly mad.</p>

<h2 id="id00868" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 9. The Evening of the Betrothal.</h2>

<p id="id00869">Villefort had, as we have said, hastened back to Madame de Saint-Meran's
in the Place du Grand Cours, and on entering the house found that the
guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon. Renee
was, with all the rest of the company, anxiously awaiting him, and his
entrance was followed by a general exclamation.</p>

<p id="id00870">"Well, Decapitator, Guardian of the State, Royalist, Brutus, what is the
matter?" said one. "Speak out."</p>

<p id="id00871">"Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?" asked another.</p>

<p id="id00872">"Has the Corsican ogre broken loose?" cried a third.</p>

<p id="id00873">"Marquise," said Villefort, approaching his future mother-in-law, "I
request your pardon for thus leaving you. Will the marquis honor me by a
few moments' private conversation?"</p>

<p id="id00874">"Ah, it is really a serious matter, then?" asked the marquis, remarking
the cloud on Villefort's brow.</p>

<p id="id00875">"So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so," added he,
turning to Renee, "judge for yourself if it be not important."</p>

<p id="id00876">"You are going to leave us?" cried Renee, unable to hide her emotion at
this unexpected announcement.</p>

<p id="id00877">"Alas," returned Villefort, "I must!"</p>

<p id="id00878">"Where, then, are you going?" asked the marquise.</p>

<p id="id00879">"That, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions
for Paris, a friend of mine is going there to-night, and will with
pleasure undertake them." The guests looked at each other.</p>

<p id="id00880">"You wish to speak to me alone?" said the marquis.</p>

<p id="id00881">"Yes, let us go to the library, please." The marquis took his arm, and
they left the salon.</p>

<p id="id00882">"Well," asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, "tell me what it
is?"</p>

<p id="id00883">"An affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate
presence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you
any landed property?"</p>

<p id="id00884">"All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand
francs."</p>

<p id="id00885">"Then sell out&#8212;sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all."</p>

<p id="id00886">"But how can I sell out here?"</p>

<p id="id00887">"You have a broker, have you not?"</p>

<p id="id00888">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id00889">"Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an
instant's delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late."</p>

<p id="id00890">"The deuce you say!" replied the marquis, "let us lose no time, then!"</p>

<p id="id00891">And, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell
out at the market price.</p>

<p id="id00892">"Now, then," said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, "I
must have another!"</p>

<p id="id00893">"To whom?"</p>

<p id="id00894">"To the king."</p>

<p id="id00895">"To the king?"</p>

<p id="id00896">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id00897">"I dare not write to his majesty."</p>

<p id="id00898">"I do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to
do so. I want a letter that will enable me to reach the king's presence
without all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would
occasion a loss of precious time."</p>

<p id="id00899">"But address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of
entry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the
day or night."</p>

<p id="id00900">"Doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my
discovery with him. The keeper would leave me in the background, and
take all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made
if I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget
the service I do him."</p>

<p id="id00901">"In that case go and get ready. I will call Salvieux and make him write
the letter."</p>

<p id="id00902">"Be as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an
hour."</p>

<p id="id00903">"Tell your coachman to stop at the door."</p>

<p id="id00904">"You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Renee,
whom I leave on such a day with great regret."</p>

<p id="id00905">"You will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person."</p>

<p id="id00906">"A thousand thanks&#8212;and now for the letter."</p>

<p id="id00907">The marquis rang, a servant entered.</p>

<p id="id00908">"Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him."</p>

<p id="id00909">"Now, then, go," said the marquis.</p>

<p id="id00910">"I shall be gone only a few moments."</p>

<p id="id00911">Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight
of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to
throw the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At
his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for
him. It was Mercedes, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come
unobserved to inquire after him.</p>

<p id="id00912">As Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. Dantes had
spoken of Mercedes, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty
and high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of
her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.</p>

<p id="id00913">"The young man you speak of," said Villefort abruptly, "is a great
criminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle." Mercedes burst
into tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.</p>

<p id="id00914">"But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is alive
or dead," said she.</p>

<p id="id00915">"I do not know; he is no longer in my hands," replied Villefort.</p>

<p id="id00916">And desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and
closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not
thus banished; like Virgil's wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his
wound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was
almost a sob, and sank into a chair.</p>

<p id="id00917">Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The
man he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on
the altar of his father's faults, appeared to him pale and threatening,
leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse,
not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow
and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up
to the very moment of death. Then he had a moment's hesitation. He had
frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his
irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest
shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort's brow, because they were
guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose
happiness he had destroyed: in this case he was not the judge, but the
executioner.</p>

<p id="id00918">As he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and which
had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill him
with vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles
instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be
healed, but Villefort's was one of those that never close, or if they
do, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment the
sweet voice of Renee had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or the
fair Mercedes had entered and said, "In the name of God, I conjure you
to restore me my affianced husband," his cold and trembling hands
would have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the
chamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort's valet, who came to
tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.</p>

<p id="id00919">Villefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one
of the drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into
his pocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head,
muttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his
servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the
carriage, ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-Meran's. The
hapless Dantes was doomed.</p>

<p id="id00920">As the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Renee
in waiting. He started when he saw Renee, for he fancied she was again
about to plead for Dantes. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she
was thinking only of Villefort's departure.</p>

<p id="id00921">She loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to
become her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and Renee,
far from pleading for Dantes, hated the man whose crime separated her
from her lover.</p>

<p id="id00922">Meanwhile what of Mercedes? She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue
de la Loge; she had returned to the Catalans, and had despairingly cast
herself on her couch. Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her hand, and
covered it with kisses that Mercedes did not even feel. She passed the
night thus. The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid no heed to
the darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was day. Grief had
made her blind to all but one object&#8212;that was Edmond.</p>

<p id="id00923">"Ah, you are there," said she, at length, turning towards Fernand.</p>

<p id="id00924">"I have not quitted you since yesterday," returned Fernand sorrowfully.</p>

<p id="id00925">M. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that Dantes
had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and
the influential persons of the city; but the report was already in
circulation that Dantes was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the
most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne
as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home
in despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more
could be done.</p>

<p id="id00926">Caderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like
M. Morrel, to aid Dantes, he had shut himself up with two bottles of
black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did not
succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not
so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows on the
table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the
light of the unsnuffed candle&#8212;spectres such as Hoffmann strews over his
punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.</p>

<p id="id00927">Danglars alone was content and joyous&#8212;he had got rid of an enemy and
made his own situation on the Pharaon secure. Danglars was one of those
men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart.
Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life of a man
was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by taking
it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires. He went to
bed at his usual hour, and slept in peace.</p>

<p id="id00928">Villefort, after having received M. de Salvieux' letter, embraced Renee,
kissed the marquise's hand, and shaken that of the marquis, started for
Paris along the Aix road.</p>

<p id="id00929">Old Dantes was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond. But
we know very well what had become of Edmond.</p>

<h2 id="id00930" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 10. The King's Closet at the Tuileries.</h2>

<p id="id00931">We will leave Villefort on the road to Paris, travelling&#8212;thanks
to trebled fees&#8212;with all speed, and passing through two or three
apartments, enter at the Tuileries the little room with the arched
window, so well known as having been the favorite closet of Napoleon and
Louis XVIII., and now of Louis Philippe.</p>

<p id="id00932">There, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from
Hartwell, and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to
great people, he was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was
carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with
gray hair, aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire,
and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius's rather
inaccurate, but much sought-after, edition of Horace&#8212;a work which
was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical
monarch.</p>

<p id="id00933">"You say, sir"&#8212;said the king.</p>

<p id="id00934">"That I am exceedingly disquieted, sire."</p>

<p id="id00935">"Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean
kine?"</p>

<p id="id00936">"No, sire, for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and
seven years of scarcity; and with a king as full of foresight as your
majesty, scarcity is not a thing to be feared."</p>

<p id="id00937">"Then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?"</p>

<p id="id00938">"Sire, I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the
south."</p>

<p id="id00939">"Well, my dear duke," replied Louis XVIII., "I think you are wrongly
informed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is very fine
weather in that direction." Man of ability as he was, Louis XVIII. liked
a pleasant jest.</p>

<p id="id00940">"Sire," continued M. de Blacas, "if it only be to reassure a faithful
servant, will your majesty send into Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphine,
trusty men, who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling
in these three provinces?"</p>

<p id="id00941">"Caninus surdis," replied the king, continuing the annotations in his<br/>

Horace.<br/></p>

<p id="id00942">"Sire," replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might seem
to comprehend the quotation, "your majesty may be perfectly right in
relying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not altogether
wrong in dreading some desperate attempt."</p>

<p id="id00943">"By whom?"</p>

<p id="id00944">"By Bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents."</p>

<p id="id00945">"My dear Blacas," said the king, "you with your alarms prevent me from
working."</p>

<p id="id00946">"And you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security."</p>

<p id="id00947">"Wait, my dear sir, wait a moment; for I have such a delightful note on
the Pastor quum traheret&#8212;wait, and I will listen to you afterwards."</p>

<p id="id00948">There was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII. wrote, in a hand as
small as possible, another note on the margin of his Horace, and then
looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of
his own, while he is only commenting upon the idea of another, said,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00949">"Go on, my dear duke, go on&#8212;I listen."</p>

<p id="id00950">"Sire," said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing
Villefort to his own profit, "I am compelled to tell you that these are
not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me; but a
serious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by me to
watch over the south" (the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words),
"has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king,
and so I hastened to you, sire."</p>

<p id="id00951">"Mala ducis avi domum," continued Louis XVIII., still annotating.</p>

<p id="id00952">"Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?"</p>

<p id="id00953">"By no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand."</p>

<p id="id00954">"Which?"</p>

<p id="id00955">"Whichever you please&#8212;there to the left."</p>

<p id="id00956">"Here, sire?"</p>

<p id="id00957">"I tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on my
left&#8212;yes, there. You will find yesterday's report of the minister of
police. But here is M. Dandre himself;" and M. Dandre, announced by the
chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.</p>

<p id="id00958">"Come in," said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, "come in, Baron, and
tell the duke all you know&#8212;the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do not
conceal anything, however serious,&#8212;let us see, the Island of Elba is a
volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling
war&#8212;bella, horrida bella." M. Dandre leaned very respectfully on the
back of a chair with his two hands, and said,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id00959">"Has your majesty perused yesterday's report?"</p>

<p id="id00960">"Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what the
report contains&#8212;give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing
in his islet."</p>

<p id="id00961">"Monsieur," said the baron to the duke, "all the servants of his majesty
must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the Island
of Elba. Bonaparte"&#8212;M. Dandre looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in
writing a note, did not even raise his head. "Bonaparte," continued
the baron, "is mortally wearied, and passes whole days in watching his
miners at work at Porto-Longone."</p>

<p id="id00962">"And scratches himself for amusement," added the king.</p>

<p id="id00963">"Scratches himself?" inquired the duke, "what does your majesty mean?"</p>

<p id="id00964">"Yes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this
hero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries
him to death, prurigo?"</p>

<p id="id00965">"And, moreover, my dear duke," continued the minister of police, "we are
almost assured that, in a very short time, the usurper will be insane."</p>

<p id="id00966">"Insane?"</p>

<p id="id00967">"Raving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly,
sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on
the seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes
'duck-and-drake' five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had
gained another Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that these are
indubitable symptoms of insanity."</p>

<p id="id00968">"Or of wisdom, my dear baron&#8212;or of wisdom," said Louis XVIII.,
laughing; "the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves
by casting pebbles into the ocean&#8212;see Plutarch's life of Scipio
Africanus."</p>

<p id="id00969">M. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the
truthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole
secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had
yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.</p>

<p id="id00970">"Well, well, Dandre," said Louis XVIII., "Blacas is not yet convinced;
let us proceed, therefore, to the usurper's conversion." The minister of
police bowed.</p>

<p id="id00971">"The usurper's conversion!" murmured the duke, looking at the king and
Dandre, who spoke alternately, like Virgil's shepherds. "The usurper
converted!"</p>

<p id="id00972">"Decidedly, my dear duke."</p>

<p id="id00973">"In what way converted?"</p>

<p id="id00974">"To good principles. Tell him all about it, baron."</p>

<p id="id00975">"Why, this is the way of it," said the minister, with the gravest air in
the world: "Napoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his
old veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he gave them their
dismissal, and exhorted them to 'serve the good king.' These were his
own words, of that I am certain."</p>

<p id="id00976">"Well, Blacas, what think you of this?" inquired the king triumphantly,
and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him.</p>

<p id="id00977">"I say, sire, that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I am;
and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the
guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty, it is probable
that I am in error. However, sire, if I might advise, your majesty will
interrogate the person of whom I spoke to you, and I will urge your
majesty to do him this honor."</p>

<p id="id00978">"Most willingly, duke; under your auspices I will receive any person you
please, but you must not expect me to be too confiding. Baron, have you
any report more recent than this dated the 20th February.&#8212;this is the
4th of March?"</p>

<p id="id00979">"No, sire, but I am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since I
left my office."</p>

<p id="id00980">"Go thither, and if there be none&#8212;well, well," continued Louis XVIII.,
"make one; that is the usual way, is it not?" and the king laughed
facetiously.</p>

<p id="id00981">"Oh, sire," replied the minister, "we have no occasion to invent any;
every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations,
coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which
they seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and rely upon
some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions."</p>

<p id="id00982">"Well, sir, go"; said Louis XVIII., "and remember that I am waiting for
you."</p>

<p id="id00983">"I will but go and return, sire; I shall be back in ten minutes."</p>

<p id="id00984">"And I, sire," said M. de Blacas, "will go and find my messenger."</p>

<p id="id00985">"Wait, sir, wait," said Louis XVIII. "Really, M. de Blacas, I
must change your armorial bearings; I will give you an eagle with
outstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to
escape, and bearing this device&#8212;Tenax."</p>

<p id="id00986">"Sire, I listen," said De Blacas, biting his nails with impatience.</p>

<p id="id00987">"I wish to consult you on this passage, 'Molli fugiens anhelitu,' you
know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf. Are you not a sportsman
and a great wolf-hunter? Well, then, what do you think of the molli
anhelitu?"</p>

<p id="id00988">"Admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to, for he
has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days."</p>

<p id="id00989">"Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when we
have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and
that without getting in the least out of breath."</p>

<p id="id00990">"Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come so
far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful information. If
only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to me, I entreat
your majesty to receive him graciously."</p>

<p id="id00991">"M. de Salvieux, my brother's chamberlain?"</p>

<p id="id00992">"Yes, sire."</p>

<p id="id00993">"He is at Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id00994">"And writes me thence."</p>

<p id="id00995">"Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?"</p>

<p id="id00996">"No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present him
to your majesty."</p>

<p id="id00997">"M. de Villefort!" cried the king, "is the messenger's name M. de<br/>

Villefort?"<br/></p>

<p id="id00998">"Yes, sire."</p>

<p id="id00999">"And he comes from Marseilles?"</p>

<p id="id01000">"In person."</p>

<p id="id01001">"Why did you not mention his name at once?" replied the king, betraying
some uneasiness.</p>

<p id="id01002">"Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty."</p>

<p id="id01003">"No, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding,
ambitious, too, and, pardieu, you know his father's name!"</p>

<p id="id01004">"His father?"</p>

<p id="id01005">"Yes, Noirtier."</p>

<p id="id01006">"Noirtier the Girondin?&#8212;Noirtier the senator?"</p>

<p id="id01007">"He himself."</p>

<p id="id01008">"And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?"</p>

<p id="id01009">"Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. I told you
Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would
sacrifice everything, even his father."</p>

<p id="id01010">"Then, sire, may I present him?"</p>

<p id="id01011">"This instant, duke! Where is he?"</p>

<p id="id01012">"Waiting below, in my carriage."</p>

<p id="id01013">"Seek him at once."</p>

<p id="id01014">"I hasten to do so." The duke left the royal presence with the speed of
a young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again. Louis
XVIII. remained alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace,
muttered,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01015">"Justum et tenacem propositi virum."</p>

<p id="id01016">M. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the
ante-chamber he was forced to appeal to the king's authority.
Villefort's dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut,
excited the susceptibility of M. de Breze, who was all astonishment at
finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king
in such attire. The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a
word&#8212;his majesty's order; and, in spite of the protestations which the
master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles,
Villefort was introduced.</p>

<p id="id01017">The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On
opening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young
magistrate's first impulse was to pause.</p>

<p id="id01018">"Come in, M. de Villefort," said the king, "come in." Villefort bowed,
and advancing a few steps, waited until the king should interrogate him.</p>

<p id="id01019">"M. de Villefort," said Louis XVIII., "the Duc de Blacas assures me you
have some interesting information to communicate."</p>

<p id="id01020">"Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it
equally important."</p>

<p id="id01021">"In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad
in your opinion as I am asked to believe?"</p>

<p id="id01022">"Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have
used, that it is not irreparable."</p>

<p id="id01023">"Speak as fully as you please, sir," said the king, who began to give
way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas's face and affected
Villefort's voice. "Speak, sir, and pray begin at the beginning; I like
order in everything."</p>

<p id="id01024">"Sire," said Villefort, "I will render a faithful report to your
majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some
obscurity in my language." A glance at the king after this discreet
and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his august
auditor, and he went on:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01025">"Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your
majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a
commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the
lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy&#8212;a
storm which menaces no less than your majesty's throne. Sire, the
usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however
mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba,
to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at
Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France.
Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has
maintained his relations with Italy and France?"</p>
