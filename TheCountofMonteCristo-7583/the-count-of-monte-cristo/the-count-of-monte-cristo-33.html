<h2 id="id09401" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 92. The Suicide.</h2>

<p id="id09402">Meanwhile Monte Cristo had also returned to town with Emmanuel and
Maximilian. Their return was cheerful. Emmanuel did not conceal his
joy at the peaceful termination of the affair, and was loud in his
expressions of delight. Morrel, in a corner of the carriage, allowed his
brother-in-law's gayety to expend itself in words, while he felt equal
inward joy, which, however, betrayed itself only in his countenance.
At the Barriere du Trone they met Bertuccio, who was waiting there,
motionless as a sentinel at his post. Monte Cristo put his head out
of the window, exchanged a few words with him in a low tone, and the
steward disappeared. "Count," said Emmanuel, when they were at the end
of the Place Royale, "put me down at my door, that my wife may not have
a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours."</p>

<p id="id09403">"If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph, I would
invite the count to our house; besides that, he doubtless has some
trembling heart to comfort. So we will take leave of our friend, and let
him hasten home."</p>

<p id="id09404">"Stop a moment," said Monte Cristo; "do not let me lose both my
companions. Return, Emmanuel, to your charming wife, and present my
best compliments to her; and do you, Morrel, accompany me to the Champs
Elysees."</p>

<p id="id09405">"Willingly," said Maximilian; "particularly as I have business in that
quarter."</p>

<p id="id09406">"Shall we wait breakfast for you?" asked Emmanuel.</p>

<p id="id09407">"No," replied the young man. The door was closed, and the carriage
proceeded. "See what good fortune I brought you!" said Morrel, when he
was alone with the count. "Have you not thought so?"</p>

<p id="id09408">"Yes," said Monte Cristo; "for that reason I wished to keep you near
me."</p>

<p id="id09409">"It is miraculous!" continued Morrel, answering his own thoughts.</p>

<p id="id09410">"What?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09411">"What has just happened."</p>

<p id="id09412">"Yes," said the Count, "you are right&#8212;it is miraculous."</p>

<p id="id09413">"For Albert is brave," resumed Morrel.</p>

<p id="id09414">"Very brave," said Monte Cristo; "I have seen him sleep with a sword
suspended over his head."</p>

<p id="id09415">"And I know he has fought two duels," said Morrel. "How can you
reconcile that with his conduct this morning?"</p>

<p id="id09416">"All owing to your influence," replied Monte Cristo, smiling.</p>

<p id="id09417">"It is well for Albert he is not in the army," said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id09418">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id09419">"An apology on the ground!" said the young captain, shaking his head.</p>

<p id="id09420">"Come," said the count mildly, "do not entertain the prejudices of
ordinary men, Morrel! Acknowledge, that if Albert is brave, he cannot
be a coward; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this
morning, and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise."</p>

<p id="id09421">"Doubtless, doubtless," said Morrel; "but I shall say, like the<br/>

Spaniard, 'He has not been so brave to-day as he was yesterday.'"<br/></p>

<p id="id09422">"You will breakfast with me, will you not, Morrel?" said the count, to
turn the conversation.</p>

<p id="id09423">"No; I must leave you at ten o'clock."</p>

<p id="id09424">"Your engagement was for breakfast, then?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id09425">Morrel smiled, and shook his head. "Still you must breakfast somewhere."</p>

<p id="id09426">"But if I am not hungry?" said the young man.</p>

<p id="id09427">"Oh," said the count, "I only know two things which destroy the
appetite,&#8212;grief&#8212;and as I am happy to see you very cheerful, it is not
that&#8212;and love. Now after what you told me this morning of your heart, I
may believe"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09428">"Well, count," replied Morrel gayly, "I will not dispute it."</p>

<p id="id09429">"But you will not make me your confidant, Maximilian?" said the count,
in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the
secret.</p>

<p id="id09430">"I showed you this morning that I had a heart, did I not, count?" Monte<br/>

Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man. "Well,"<br/>

continued the latter, "since that heart is no longer with you in the<br/>

Bois de Vincennes, it is elsewhere, and I must go and find it."<br/></p>

<p id="id09431">"Go," said the count deliberately; "go, dear friend, but promise me if
you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this
world, that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love,
and that I love you, Morrel."</p>

<p id="id09432">"I will remember it," said the young man, "as selfish children recollect
their parents when they want their aid. When I need your assistance, and
the moment arrives, I will come to you, count."</p>

<p id="id09433">"Well, I rely upon your promise. Good-by, then."</p>

<p id="id09434">"Good-by, till we meet again." They had arrived in the Champs Elysees.
Monte Cristo opened the carriage-door, Morrel sprang out on the
pavement, Bertuccio was waiting on the steps. Morrel disappeared down
the Avenue de Marigny, and Monte Cristo hastened to join Bertuccio.</p>

<p id="id09435">"Well?" asked he.</p>

<p id="id09436">"She is going to leave her house," said the steward.</p>

<p id="id09437">"And her son?"</p>

<p id="id09438">"Florentin, his valet, thinks he is going to do the same."</p>

<p id="id09439">"Come this way." Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study, wrote the
letter we have seen, and gave it to the steward. "Go," said he quickly.
"But first, let Haidee be informed that I have returned."</p>

<p id="id09440">"Here I am," said the young girl, who at the sound of the carriage had
run down-stairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count
return safely. Bertuccio left. Every transport of a daughter finding a
father, all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover, were felt
by Haidee during the first moments of this meeting, which she had so
eagerly expected. Doubtless, although less evident, Monte Cristo's joy
was not less intense. Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the
dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground
absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is
outwardly apparent.</p>

<p id="id09441">Monte Cristo was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time
dared to believe, that there were two Mercedes in the world, and he
might yet be happy. His eye, elate with happiness, was reading eagerly
the tearful gaze of Haidee, when suddenly the door opened. The count
knit his brow. "M. de Morcerf!" said Baptistin, as if that name sufficed
for his excuse. In fact, the count's face brightened.</p>

<p id="id09442">"Which," asked he, "the viscount or the count?"</p>

<p id="id09443">"The count."</p>

<p id="id09444">"Oh," exclaimed Haidee, "is it not yet over?"</p>

<p id="id09445">"I know not if it is finished, my beloved child," said Monte Cristo,
taking the young girl's hands; "but I do know you have nothing more to
fear."</p>

<p id="id09446">"But it is the wretched"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09447">"That man cannot injure me, Haidee," said Monte Cristo; "it was his son
alone that there was cause to fear."</p>

<p id="id09448">"And what I have suffered," said the young girl, "you shall never know,
my lord." Monte Cristo smiled. "By my father's tomb," said he, extending
his hand over the head of the young girl, "I swear to you, Haidee, that
if any misfortune happens, it will not be to me."</p>

<p id="id09449">"I believe you, my lord, as implicitly as if God had spoken to me," said
the young girl, presenting her forehead to him. Monte Cristo pressed on
that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once,
the one violently, the other heavily. "Oh," murmured the count, "shall
I then be permitted to love again? Ask M. de Morcerf into the
drawing-room," said he to Baptistin, while he led the beautiful Greek
girl to a private staircase.</p>

<p id="id09450">We must explain this visit, which although expected by Monte Cristo, is
unexpected to our readers. While Mercedes, as we have said, was making
a similar inventory of her property to Albert's, while she was arranging
her jewels, shutting her drawers, collecting her keys, to leave
everything in perfect order, she did not perceive a pale and sinister
face at a glass door which threw light into the passage, from which
everything could be both seen and heard. He who was thus looking,
without being heard or seen, probably heard and saw all that passed in
Madame de Morcerf's apartments. From that glass door the pale-faced
man went to the count's bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the
curtain of a window overlooking the court-yard. He remained there ten
minutes, motionless and dumb, listening to the beating of his own heart.
For him those ten minutes were very long. It was then Albert, returning
from his meeting with the count, perceived his father watching for his
arrival behind a curtain, and turned aside. The count's eye expanded; he
knew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully, and that in every country
in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel. Albert returned
safely&#8212;then the count was revenged.</p>

<p id="id09451">An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the
last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear
the aspect, not of a downy couch, but of a tomb. But as we have said, he
waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of
his triumph. He easily understood why his son did not come to see him
before he went to avenge his father's honor; but when that was done, why
did not his son come and throw himself into his arms?</p>

<p id="id09452">It was then, when the count could not see Albert, that he sent for his
servant, who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him.
Ten minutes afterwards, General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black
coat with a military collar, black pantaloons, and black gloves. He had
apparently given previous orders, for as he reached the bottom step his
carriage came from the coach-house ready for him. The valet threw into
the carriage his military cloak, in which two swords were wrapped, and,
shutting the door, he took his seat by the side of the coachman. The
coachman stooped down for his orders.</p>

<p id="id09453">"To the Champs Elysees," said the general; "the Count of Monte Cristo's.
Hurry!" The horses bounded beneath the whip; and in five minutes they
stopped before the count's door. M. de Morcerf opened the door himself,
and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered
the open door with his servant.</p>

<p id="id09454">A moment afterwards, Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte
Cristo, and the latter, leading Haidee aside, ordered that Morcerf be
asked into the drawing-room. The general was pacing the room the third
time when, in turning, he perceived Monte Cristo at the door. "Ah, it
is M. de Morcerf," said Monte Cristo quietly; "I thought I had not heard
aright."</p>

<p id="id09455">"Yes, it is I," said the count, whom a frightful contraction of the lips
prevented from articulating freely.</p>

<p id="id09456">"May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing M. de<br/>

Morcerf so early?"<br/></p>

<p id="id09457">"Had you not a meeting with my son this morning?" asked the general.</p>

<p id="id09458">"I had," replied the count.</p>

<p id="id09459">"And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you, and to
endeavor to kill you."</p>

<p id="id09460">"Yes, sir, he had very good ones; but you see that in spite of them he
has not killed me, and did not even fight."</p>

<p id="id09461">"Yet he considered you the cause of his father's dishonor, the cause of
the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house."</p>

<p id="id09462">"It is true, sir," said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness; "a
secondary cause, but not the principal."</p>

<p id="id09463">"Doubtless you made, then, some apology or explanation?"</p>

<p id="id09464">"I explained nothing, and it is he who apologized to me."</p>

<p id="id09465">"But to what do you attribute this conduct?"</p>

<p id="id09466">"To the conviction, probably, that there was one more guilty than I."</p>

<p id="id09467">"And who was that?"</p>

<p id="id09468">"His father."</p>

<p id="id09469">"That may be," said the count, turning pale; "but you know the guilty do
not like to find themselves convicted."</p>

<p id="id09470">"I know it, and I expected this result."</p>

<p id="id09471">"You expected my son would be a coward?" cried the count.</p>

<p id="id09472">"M. Albert de Morcerf is no coward!" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09473">"A man who holds a sword in his hand, and sees a mortal enemy within
reach of that sword, and does not fight, is a coward! Why is he not here
that I may tell him so?"</p>

<p id="id09474">"Sir." replied Monte Cristo coldly, "I did not expect that you had come
here to relate to me your little family affairs. Go and tell M. Albert
that, and he may know what to answer you."</p>

<p id="id09475">"Oh, no, no," said the general, smiling faintly, "I did not come for
that purpose; you are right. I came to tell you that I also look upon
you as my enemy. I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively; that
it seems as if I had always known you, and always hated you; and, in
short, since the young people of the present day will not fight, it
remains for us to do so. Do you think so, sir?"</p>

<p id="id09476">"Certainly. And when I told you I had foreseen the result, it is the
honor of your visit I alluded to."</p>

<p id="id09477">"So much the better. Are you prepared?"</p>

<p id="id09478">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p id="id09479">"You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead," said the general,
whose teeth were clinched with rage. "Until one of us dies," repeated
Monte Cristo, moving his head slightly up and down.</p>

<p id="id09480">"Let us start, then; we need no witnesses."</p>

<p id="id09481">"Very true," said Monte Cristo; "it is unnecessary, we know each other
so well!"</p>

<p id="id09482">"On the contrary," said the count, "we know so little of each other."</p>

<p id="id09483">"Indeed?" said Monte Cristo, with the same indomitable coolness; "let
us see. Are you not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the eve of the
battle of Waterloo? Are you not the Lieutenant Fernand who served as
guide and spy to the French army in Spain? Are you not the Captain
Fernand who betrayed, sold, and murdered his benefactor, Ali? And have
not all these Fernands, united, made Lieutenant-General, the Count of
Morcerf, peer of France?"</p>

<p id="id09484">"Oh," cried the general, as if branded with a hot iron, "wretch,&#8212;to
reproach me with my shame when about, perhaps, to kill me! No, I did
not say I was a stranger to you. I know well, demon, that you have
penetrated into the darkness of the past, and that you have read, by the
light of what torch I know not, every page of my life; but perhaps I
may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings.
No&#8212;no, I am aware you know me; but I know you only as an adventurer
sewn up in gold and jewellery. You call yourself in Paris the Count of
Monte Cristo; in Italy, Sinbad the Sailor; in Malta, I forget what. But
it is your real name I want to know, in the midst of your hundred names,
that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight, at the moment when I
plunge my sword through your heart."</p>

<p id="id09485">The Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale; his eye seemed to
burn with a devouring fire. He leaped towards a dressing-room near his
bedroom, and in less than a moment, tearing off his cravat, his coat
and waistcoat, he put on a sailor's jacket and hat, from beneath which
rolled his long black hair. He returned thus, formidable and implacable,
advancing with his arms crossed on his breast, towards the general,
who could not understand why he had disappeared, but who on seeing him
again, and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him, drew
back, and only stopped when he found a table to support his clinched
hand. "Fernand," cried he, "of my hundred names I need only tell you
one, to overwhelm you! But you guess it now, do you not?&#8212;or, rather,
you remember it? For, notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures,
I show you to-day a face which the happiness of revenge makes young
again&#8212;a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your
marriage with Mercedes, my betrothed!"</p>

<p id="id09486">The general, with his head thrown back, hands extended, gaze fixed,
looked silently at this dreadful apparition; then seeking the wall to
support him, he glided along close to it until he reached the door,
through which he went out backwards, uttering this single mournful,
lamentable, distressing cry,&#8212;"Edmond Dantes!" Then, with sighs which
were unlike any human sound, he dragged himself to the door, reeled
across the court-yard, and falling into the arms of his valet, he said
in a voice scarcely intelligible,&#8212;"Home, home." The fresh air and the
shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants, partly
recalled his senses, but the ride was short, and as he drew near his
house all his wretchedness revived. He stopped at a short distance from
the house and alighted.</p>

<p id="id09487">The door was wide open, a hackney-coach was standing in the middle of
the yard&#8212;a strange sight before so noble a mansion; the count looked
at it with terror, but without daring to inquire its meaning, he rushed
towards his apartment. Two persons were coming down the stairs; he had
only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them. It was Mercedes leaning
on her son's arm and leaving the house. They passed close by the unhappy
being, who, concealed behind the damask curtain, almost felt Mercedes
dress brush past him, and his son's warm breath, pronouncing these
words,&#8212;"Courage, mother! Come, this is no longer our home!" The words
died away, the steps were lost in the distance. The general drew himself
up, clinging to the curtain; he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever
escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by
his wife and son. He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the
hackney-coach, then the coachman's voice, and then the rolling of the
heavy vehicle shook the windows. He darted to his bedroom to see once
more all he had loved in the world; but the hackney-coach drove on and
the head of neither Mercedes nor her son appeared at the window to take
a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband. And at the
very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report
was heard, and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the
window, which was broken by the explosion.</p>

<h2 id="id09488" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 93. Valentine.</h2>

<p id="id09489">We may easily conceive where Morrel's appointment was. On leaving Monte
Cristo he walked slowly towards Villefort's; we say slowly, for Morrel
had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps, but he
had hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be alone
with his thoughts. He knew his time well&#8212;the hour when Valentine was
giving Noirtier his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in the
performance of this pious duty. Noirtier and Valentine had given him
leave to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that
permission. He had arrived; Valentine was expecting him. Uneasy and
almost crazed, she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather. This
uneasiness, amounting almost to frenzy, arose from the report Morcerf's
adventure had made in the world, for the affair at the opera was
generally known. No one at Villefort's doubted that a duel would ensue
from it. Valentine, with her woman's instinct, guessed that Morrel would
be Monte Cristo's second, and from the young man's well-known courage
and his great affection for the count, she feared that he would not
content himself with the passive part assigned to him. We may easily
understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for, given, and
received; and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his
beloved, when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy
as it was unexpected.</p>

<p id="id09490">"Now," said Valentine, motioning to Morrel to sit down near her
grandfather, while she took her seat on his footstool,&#8212;"now let us talk
about our own affairs. You know, Maximilian, grandpapa once thought
of leaving this house, and taking an apartment away from M. de
Villefort's."</p>

<p id="id09491">"Yes," said Maximilian, "I recollect the project, of which I highly
approved."</p>

<p id="id09492">"Well," said Valentine, "you may approve again, for grandpapa is again
thinking of it."</p>

<p id="id09493">"Bravo," said Maximilian.</p>

<p id="id09494">"And do you know," said Valentine, "what reason grandpapa gives for
leaving this house." Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence,
but she did not notice him; her looks, her eyes, her smile, were all for
Morrel.</p>

<p id="id09495">"Oh, whatever may be M. Noirtier's reason," answered Morrel, "I can
readily believe it to be a good one."</p>

<p id="id09496">"An excellent one," said Valentine. "He pretends the air of the Faubourg<br/>

St. Honore is not good for me."<br/></p>

<p id="id09497">"Indeed?" said Morrel; "in that M. Noirtier may be right; you have not
seemed to be well for the last fortnight."</p>

<p id="id09498">"Not very," said Valentine. "And grandpapa has become my physician, and<br/>

I have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything."<br/></p>

<p id="id09499">"Do you then really suffer?" asked Morrel quickly.</p>

<p id="id09500">"Oh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness, that
is all. I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were
struggling to get accustomed to something." Noirtier did not lose a
word of what Valentine said. "And what treatment do you adopt for this
singular complaint?"</p>

<p id="id09501">"A very simple one," said Valentine. "I swallow every morning a spoonful<br/>

of the mixture prepared for my grandfather. When I say one spoonful,<br/>

I began by one&#8212;now I take four. Grandpapa says it is a panacea."<br/>

Valentine smiled, but it was evident that she suffered.<br/></p>

<p id="id09502">Maximilian, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her. She was very
beautiful, but her usual pallor had increased; her eyes were more
brilliant than ever, and her hands, which were generally white like
mother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a
yellowish hue. From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier. The
latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed
by her affection, and he also, like Morrel, followed those traces of
inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer
that they escaped the notice of every one but the grandfather and the
lover.</p>

<p id="id09503">"But," said Morrel, "I thought this mixture, of which you now take four
spoonfuls, was prepared for M. Noirtier?"</p>

<p id="id09504">"I know it is very bitter," said Valentine; "so bitter, that all I drink
afterwards appears to have the same taste." Noirtier looked inquiringly
at his granddaughter. "Yes, grandpapa," said Valentine; "it is so. Just
now, before I came down to you, I drank a glass of sugared water; I left
half, because it seemed so bitter." Noirtier turned pale, and made a
sign that he wished to speak. Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary.
Noirtier watched her with evident anguish. In fact, the blood was
rushing to the young girl's head already, her cheeks were becoming
red. "Oh," cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, "this is
singular! I can't see! Did the sun shine in my eyes?" And she leaned
against the window.</p>

<p id="id09505">"The sun is not shining," said Morrel, more alarmed by Noirtier's
expression than by Valentine's indisposition. He ran towards her. The
young girl smiled. "Cheer up," said she to Noirtier. "Do not be alarmed,
Maximilian; it is nothing, and has already passed away. But listen! Do I
not hear a carriage in the court-yard?" She opened Noirtier's door, ran
to a window in the passage, and returned hastily. "Yes," said she,
"it is Madame Danglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us.
Good-by;&#8212;I must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather,
farewell till I see you again. Stay with grandpapa, Maximilian; I
promise you not to persuade them to stay."</p>

<p id="id09506">Morrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little
staircase which led both to Madame de Villefort's apartments and to
hers. As soon as she was gone, Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take
the dictionary. Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how
to understand the old man quickly. Accustomed, however, as he was to the
work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find
every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the
thought of the old man was translated by these words, "Fetch the glass
of water and the decanter from Valentine's room."</p>

<p id="id09507">Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois's
situation, and in Noirtier's name gave that order. The servant soon
returned. The decanter and the glass were completely empty. Noirtier
made a sign that he wished to speak. "Why are the glass and decanter
empty?" asked he; "Valentine said she only drank half the glassful." The
translation of this new question occupied another five minutes. "I
do not know," said the servant, "but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle
Valentine's room: perhaps she has emptied them."</p>

<p id="id09508">"Ask her," said Morrel, translating Noirtier's thought this time by
his look. The servant went out, but returned almost immediately.
"Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de
Villefort's," said he; "and in passing, as she was thirsty, she drank
what remained in the glass; as for the decanter, Master Edward had
emptied that to make a pond for his ducks." Noirtier raised his eyes to
heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke. From that
moment the old man's eyes were fixed on the door, and did not quit it.</p>

<p id="id09509">It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen;
they had been ushered into Madame de Villefort's room, who had said she
would receive them there. That is why Valentine passed through her room,
which was on a level with Valentine's, and only separated from it by
Edward's. The two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of
official stiffness which preludes a formal communication. Among worldly
people manner is contagious. Madame de Villefort received them with
equal solemnity. Valentine entered at this moment, and the formalities
were resumed. "My dear friend," said the baroness, while the two young
people were shaking hands, "I and Eugenie are come to be the first to
announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince
Cavalcanti." Danglars kept up the title of prince. The popular banker
found that it answered better than count. "Allow me to present you
my sincere congratulations," replied Madame de Villefort. "Prince
Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities."</p>

<p id="id09510">"Listen," said the baroness, smiling; "speaking to you as a friend I can
say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be. He has about him
a little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize, at
first sight, the Italian or German nobleman. Besides, he gives evidence
of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and as to
suitability, M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic&#8212;that
is his word."</p>

<p id="id09511">"And then," said Eugenie, while turning over the leaves of Madame de
Villefort's album, "add that you have taken a great fancy to the young
man."</p>

<p id="id09512">"And," said Madame de Villefort, "I need not ask you if you share that
fancy."</p>

<p id="id09513">"I?" replied Eugenie with her usual candor. "Oh, not the least in the
world, madame! My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares, or
the caprices of any man, but to be an artist, and consequently free in
heart, in person, and in thought." Eugenie pronounced these words with
so firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentine's cheeks. The timid
girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have
none of the timidities of woman.</p>

<p id="id09514">"At any rate," said she, "since I am to be married whether I will or
not, I ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my
engagement with M. Albert de Morcerf, or I should this day have been the
wife of a dishonored man."</p>

<p id="id09515">"It is true," said the baroness, with that strange simplicity sometimes
met with among fashionable ladies, and of which plebeian intercourse can
never entirely deprive them,&#8212;"it is very true that had not the Morcerfs
hesitated, my daughter would have married Monsieur Albert. The general
depended much on it; he even came to force M. Danglars. We have had a
narrow escape."</p>

<p id="id09516">"But," said Valentine, timidly, "does all the father's shame revert upon
the son? Monsieur Albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason
charged against the general."</p>

<p id="id09517">"Excuse me," said the implacable young girl, "Monsieur Albert claims and
well deserves his share. It appears that after having challenged M.
de Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday, he apologized on the ground
to-day."</p>

<p id="id09518">"Impossible," said Madame de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id09519">"Ah, my dear friend," said Madame Danglars, with the same simplicity
we before noticed, "it is a fact. I heard it from M. Debray, who was
present at the explanation." Valentine also knew the truth, but she did
not answer. A single word had reminded her that Morrel was expecting
her in M. Noirtier's room. Deeply engaged with a sort of inward
contemplation, Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the
conversation. She would, indeed, have found it impossible to repeat what
had been said the last few minutes, when suddenly Madame Danglars' hand,
pressed on her arm, aroused her from her lethargy.</p>

<p id="id09520">"What is it?" said she, starting at Madame Danglars' touch as she would
have done from an electric shock. "It is, my dear Valentine," said the
baroness, "that you are, doubtless, suffering."</p>

<p id="id09521">"I?" said the young girl, passing her hand across her burning forehead.</p>

<p id="id09522">"Yes, look at yourself in that glass; you have turned pale and then red
successively, three or four times in one minute."</p>

<p id="id09523">"Indeed," cried Eugenie, "you are very pale!"</p>

<p id="id09524">"Oh, do not be alarmed; I have been so for many days." Artless as she
was, the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave,
and besides, Madame de Villefort came to her assistance. "Retire,
Valentine," said she; "you are really suffering, and these ladies will
excuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore you." Valentine
kissed Eugenie, bowed to Madame Danglars, who had already risen to take
her leave, and went out. "That poor child," said Madame de Villefort
when Valentine was gone, "she makes me very uneasy, and I should not be
astonished if she had some serious illness."</p>

<p id="id09525">Meanwhile, Valentine, in a sort of excitement which she could not quite
understand, had crossed Edward's room without noticing some trick of
the child, and through her own had reached the little staircase. She was
within three steps of the bottom; she already heard Morrel's voice, when
suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes, her stiffened foot missed the
step, her hands had no power to hold the baluster, and falling against
the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor. Morrel
bounded to the door, opened it, and found Valentine stretched out at the
bottom of the stairs. Quick as a flash, he raised her in his arms and
placed her in a chair. Valentine opened her eyes.</p>

<p id="id09526">"Oh, what a clumsy thing I am," said she with feverish volubility;
"I don't know my way. I forgot there were three more steps before the
landing."</p>

<p id="id09527">"You have hurt yourself, perhaps," said Morrel. "What can I do for you,
Valentine?" Valentine looked around her; she saw the deepest terror
depicted in Noirtier's eyes. "Don't worry, dear grandpapa," said she,
endeavoring to smile; "it is nothing&#8212;it is nothing; I was giddy, that
is all."</p>

<p id="id09528">"Another attack of giddiness," said Morrel, clasping his hands. "Oh,
attend to it, Valentine, I entreat you."</p>

<p id="id09529">"But no," said Valentine,&#8212;"no, I tell you it is all past, and it was
nothing. Now, let me tell you some news; Eugenie is to be married in
a week, and in three days there is to be a grand feast, a betrothal
festival. We are all invited, my father, Madame de Villefort, and I&#8212;at
least, I understood it so."</p>

<p id="id09530">"When will it be our turn to think of these things? Oh, Valentine,
you who have so much influence over your grandpapa, try to make him
answer&#8212;Soon."</p>

<p id="id09531">"And do you," said Valentine, "depend on me to stimulate the tardiness
and arouse the memory of grandpapa?"</p>

<p id="id09532">"Yes," cried Morrel, "make haste. So long as you are not mine,<br/>

Valentine, I shall always think I may lose you."<br/></p>

<p id="id09533">"Oh," replied Valentine with a convulsive movement, "oh, indeed,
Maximilian, you are too timid for an officer, for a soldier who,
they say, never knows fear. Ah, ha, ha!" she burst into a forced and
melancholy laugh, her arms stiffened and twisted, her head fell back
on her chair, and she remained motionless. The cry of terror which
was stopped on Noirtier's lips, seemed to start from his eyes. Morrel
understood it; he knew he must call assistance. The young man rang the
bell violently; the housemaid who had been in Mademoiselle Valentine's
room, and the servant who had replaced Barrois, ran in at the same
moment. Valentine was so pale, so cold, so inanimate that without
listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which
pervaded that house, and they flew into the passage crying for help.
Madame Danglars and Eugenie were going out at that moment; they heard
the cause of the disturbance. "I told you so!" exclaimed Madame de
Villefort. "Poor child!"</p>

<h2 id="id09534" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 94. Maximilian's Avowal.</h2>

<p id="id09535">At the same moment M. de Villefort's voice was heard calling from his
study, "What is the matter?" Morrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered
his self-command, and with a glance indicated the closet where once
before under somewhat similar circumstances, he had taken refuge. He had
only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet
when the procureur's footstep was heard in the passage. Villefort sprang
into the room, ran to Valentine, and took her in his arms. "A physician,
a physician,&#8212;M. d'Avrigny!" cried Villefort; "or rather I will go for
him myself." He flew from the apartment, and Morrel at the same moment
darted out at the other door. He had been struck to the heart by a
frightful recollection&#8212;the conversation he had heard between the doctor
and Villefort the night of Madame de Saint-Meran's death, recurred to
him; these symptoms, to a less alarming extent, were the same which had
preceded the death of Barrois. At the same time Monte Cristo's voice
seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours
before, "Whatever you want, Morrel, come to me; I have great power."
More rapidly than thought, he darted down the Rue Matignon, and thence
to the Avenue des Champs Elysees.</p>

<p id="id09536">Meanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M. d'Avrigny's
door. He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed. Villefort ran
up-stairs without saying a word. The porter knew him, and let him pass,
only calling to him, "In his study, Monsieur Procureur&#8212;in his study!"
Villefort pushed, or rather forced, the door open. "Ah," said the
doctor, "is it you?"</p>

<p id="id09537">"Yes," said Villefort, closing the door after him, "it is I, who am
come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone. Doctor, my house is
accursed!"</p>

<p id="id09538">"What?" said the latter with apparent coolness, but with deep emotion,
"have you another invalid?"</p>

<p id="id09539">"Yes, doctor," cried Villefort, clutching his hair, "yes!"</p>

<p id="id09540">D'Avrigny's look implied, "I told you it would be so." Then he slowly
uttered these words, "Who is now dying in your house? What new victim is
going to accuse you of weakness before God?" A mournful sob burst
from Villefort's heart; he approached the doctor, and seizing his
arm,&#8212;"Valentine," said he, "it is Valentine's turn!"</p>

<p id="id09541">"Your daughter?" cried d'Avrigny with grief and surprise.</p>

<p id="id09542">"You see you were deceived," murmured the magistrate; "come and see her,
and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her."</p>

<p id="id09543">"Each time you have applied to me," said the doctor, "it has been too
late; still I will go. But let us make haste, sir; with the enemies you
have to do with there is no time to be lost."</p>

<p id="id09544">"Oh, this time, doctor, you shall not have to reproach me with weakness.<br/>

This time I will know the assassin, and will pursue him."<br/></p>

<p id="id09545">"Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her,"
said d'Avrigny. "Come." The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort
took them back at full speed, and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte
Cristo's door. The count was in his study and was reading with an angry
look something which Bertuccio had brought in haste. Hearing the name
of Morrel, who had left him only two hours before, the count raised his
head, arose, and sprang to meet him. "What is the matter, Maximilian?"
asked he; "you are pale, and the perspiration rolls from your forehead."
Morrel fell into a chair. "Yes," said he, "I came quickly; I wanted to
speak to you."</p>

<p id="id09546">"Are all your family well?" asked the count, with an affectionate
benevolence, whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt.</p>

<p id="id09547">"Thank you, count&#8212;thank you," said the young man, evidently embarrassed
how to begin the conversation; "yes, every one in my family is well."</p>

<p id="id09548">"So much the better; yet you have something to tell me?" replied the
count with increased anxiety.</p>

<p id="id09549">"Yes," said Morrel, "it is true; I have but now left a house where death
has just entered, to run to you."</p>

<p id="id09550">"Are you then come from M. de Morcerf's?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09551">"No," said Morrel; "is some one dead in his house?"</p>

<p id="id09552">"The general has just blown his brains out," replied Monte Cristo with
great coolness.</p>

<p id="id09553">"Oh, what a dreadful event!" cried Maximilian.</p>

<p id="id09554">"Not for the countess, or for Albert," said Monte Cristo; "a dead father
or husband is better than a dishonored one,&#8212;blood washes out shame."</p>

<p id="id09555">"Poor countess," said Maximilian, "I pity her very much; she is so noble
a woman!"</p>

<p id="id09556">"Pity Albert also, Maximilian; for believe me he is the worthy son
of the countess. But let us return to yourself. You have hastened to
me&#8212;can I have the happiness of being useful to you?"</p>

<p id="id09557">"Yes, I need your help: that is I thought like a madman that you could
lend me your assistance in a case where God alone can succor me."</p>

<p id="id09558">"Tell me what it is," replied Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09559">"Oh," said Morrel, "I know not, indeed, if I may reveal this secret
to mortal ears, but fatality impels me, necessity constrains me,
count"&#8212;Morrel hesitated. "Do you think I love you?" said Monte Cristo,
taking the young man's hand affectionately in his.</p>

<p id="id09560">"Oh, you encourage me, and something tells me there," placing his hand
on his heart, "that I ought to have no secret from you."</p>

<p id="id09561">"You are right, Morrel; God is speaking to your heart, and your heart
speaks to you. Tell me what it says."</p>

<p id="id09562">"Count, will you allow me to send Baptistin to inquire after some one
you know?"</p>

<p id="id09563">"I am at your service, and still more my servants."</p>

<p id="id09564">"Oh, I cannot live if she is not better."</p>

<p id="id09565">"Shall I ring for Baptistin?"</p>

<p id="id09566">"No, I will go and speak to him myself." Morrel went out, called<br/>

Baptistin, and whispered a few words to him. The valet ran directly.<br/>

"Well, have you sent?" asked Monte Cristo, seeing Morrel return.<br/></p>

<p id="id09567">"Yes, and now I shall be more calm."</p>

<p id="id09568">"You know I am waiting," said Monte Cristo, smiling.</p>

<p id="id09569">"Yes, and I will tell you. One evening I was in a garden; a clump of
trees concealed me; no one suspected I was there. Two persons passed
near me&#8212;allow me to conceal their names for the present; they were
speaking in an undertone, and yet I was so interested in what they said
that I did not lose a single word."</p>

<p id="id09570">"This is a gloomy introduction, if I may judge from your pallor and
shuddering, Morrel."</p>

<p id="id09571">"Oh, yes, very gloomy, my friend. Some one had just died in the house
to which that garden belonged. One of the persons whose conversation
I overheard was the master of the house; the other, the physician. The
former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear, for it was the
second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly
entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some
exterminating angel, as an object of God's anger."</p>

<p id="id09572">"Ah, indeed?" said Monte Cristo, looking earnestly at the young man, and
by an imperceptible movement turning his chair, so that he remained
in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilian's face. "Yes,"
continued Morrel, "death had entered that house twice within one month."</p>

<p id="id09573">"And what did the doctor answer?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09574">"He replied&#8212;he replied, that the death was not a natural one, and must
be attributed"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09575">"To what?"</p>

<p id="id09576">"To poison."</p>

<p id="id09577">"Indeed?" said Monte Cristo with a slight cough which in moments of
extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush, or his pallor, or the
intense interest with which he listened; "indeed, Maximilian, did you
hear that?"</p>

<p id="id09578">"Yes, my dear count, I heard it; and the doctor added that if another
death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice." Monte Cristo
listened, or appeared to do so, with the greatest calmness. "Well,"
said Maximilian, "death came a third time, and neither the master of
the house nor the doctor said a word. Death is now, perhaps, striking a
fourth blow. Count, what am I bound to do, being in possession of this
secret?"</p>

<p id="id09579">"My dear friend," said Monte Cristo, "you appear to be relating an
adventure which we all know by heart. I know the house where you heard
it, or one very similar to it; a house with a garden, a master, a
physician, and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths.
Well, I have not intercepted your confidence, and yet I know all that
as well as you, and I have no conscientious scruples. No, it does not
concern me. You say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that
house to God's anger&#8212;well, who says your supposition is not reality?
Do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass
over. If it is God's justice, instead of his anger, which is walking
through that house, Maximilian, turn away your face and let his justice
accomplish its purpose." Morrel shuddered. There was something mournful,
solemn, and terrible in the count's manner. "Besides," continued he, in
so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person
speaking&#8212;"besides, who says that it will begin again?"</p>

<p id="id09580">"It has returned, count," exclaimed Morrel; "that is why I hastened to
you."</p>

<p id="id09581">"Well, what do you wish me to do? Do you wish me, for instance, to give
information to the procureur?" Monte Cristo uttered the last words with
so much meaning that Morrel, starting up, cried out, "You know of whom I
speak, count, do you not?"</p>

<p id="id09582">"Perfectly well, my good friend; and I will prove it to you by putting
the dots to the 'i,' or rather by naming the persons. You were walking
one evening in M. de Villefort's garden; from what you relate, I suppose
it to have been the evening of Madame de Saint-Meran's death. You
heard M. de Villefort talking to M. d'Avrigny about the death of M. de
Saint-Meran, and that no less surprising, of the countess. M. d'Avrigny
said he believed they both proceeded from poison; and you, honest man,
have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to
know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret. Why do you torment
them? 'Conscience, what hast thou to do with me?' as Sterne said. My
dear fellow, let them sleep on, if they are asleep; let them grow pale
in their drowsiness, if they are disposed to do so, and pray do you
remain in peace, who have no remorse to disturb you." Deep grief was
depicted on Morrel's features; he seized Monte Cristo's hand. "But it is
beginning again, I say!"</p>

<p id="id09583">"Well," said the Count, astonished at his perseverance, which he could
not understand, and looking still more earnestly at Maximilian, "let it
begin again,&#8212;it is like the house of the Atreidae; [*] God has condemned
them, and they must submit to their punishment. They will all disappear,
like the fabrics children build with cards, and which fall, one by one,
under the breath of their builder, even if there are two hundred of
them. Three months since it was M. de Saint-Meran; Madame de Saint-Meran
two months since; the other day it was Barrois; to-day, the old
Noirtier, or young Valentine."</p>

<p id="id09584" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     * In the old Greek legend the Atreidae, or children of
     Atreus, were doomed to punishment because of the abominable
     crime of their father. The Agamemnon of Aeschylus is based
     on this legend.</p>

<p id="id09585">"You knew it?" cried Morrel, in such a paroxysm of terror that Monte
Cristo started,&#8212;he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved;
"you knew it, and said nothing?"</p>

<p id="id09586">"And what is it to me?" replied Monte Cristo, shrugging his shoulders;
"do I know those people? and must I lose the one to save the other?
Faith, no, for between the culprit and the victim I have no choice."</p>

<p id="id09587">"But I," cried Morrel, groaning with sorrow, "I love her!"</p>

<p id="id09588">"You love?&#8212;whom?" cried Monte Cristo, starting to his feet, and seizing
the two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven.</p>

<p id="id09589">"I love most fondly&#8212;I love madly&#8212;I love as a man who would give his
life-blood to spare her a tear&#8212;I love Valentine de Villefort, who is
being murdered at this moment! Do you understand me? I love her; and I
ask God and you how I can save her?" Monte Cristo uttered a cry which
those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion.
"Unhappy man," cried he, wringing his hands in his turn; "you love
Valentine,&#8212;that daughter of an accursed race!" Never had Morrel
witnessed such an expression&#8212;never had so terrible an eye flashed
before his face&#8212;never had the genius of terror he had so often seen,
either on the battle-field or in the murderous nights of Algeria, shaken
around him more dreadful fire. He drew back terrified.</p>

<p id="id09590">As for Monte Cristo, after this ebullition he closed his eyes as
if dazzled by internal light. In a moment he restrained himself so
powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided, as
turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun's genial influence when the
cloud has passed. This silence, self-control, and struggle lasted about
twenty seconds, then the count raised his pallid face. "See," said he,
"my dear friend, how God punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men
for their indifference, by presenting dreadful scenes to their view. I,
who was looking on, an eager and curious spectator,&#8212;I, who was watching
the working of this mournful tragedy,&#8212;I, who like a wicked angel was
laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy (a secret is
easily kept by the rich and powerful), I am in my turn bitten by the
serpent whose tortuous course I was watching, and bitten to the heart!"</p>

<p id="id09591">Morrel groaned. "Come, come," continued the count, "complaints are
unavailing, be a man, be strong, be full of hope, for I am here and will
watch over you." Morrel shook his head sorrowfully. "I tell you to
hope. Do you understand me?" cried Monte Cristo. "Remember that I
never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived. It is twelve o'clock,
Maximilian; thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the
evening, or to-morrow morning. Listen, Morrel&#8212;it is noon; if Valentine
is not now dead, she will not die."</p>

<p id="id09592">"How so?" cried Morrel, "when I left her dying?" Monte Cristo pressed
his hands to his forehead. What was passing in that brain, so loaded
with dreadful secrets? What does the angel of light or the angel of
darkness say to that mind, at once implacable and generous? God only
knows.</p>

<p id="id09593">Monte Cristo raised his head once more, and this time he was calm as
a child awaking from its sleep. "Maximilian," said he, "return home. I
command you not to stir&#8212;attempt nothing, not to let your countenance
betray a thought, and I will send you tidings. Go."</p>

<p id="id09594">"Oh, count, you overwhelm me with that coolness. Have you, then, power
against death? Are you superhuman? Are you an angel?" And the young
man, who had never shrunk from danger, shrank before Monte Cristo with
indescribable terror. But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy
and sweet a smile, that Maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes.
"I can do much for you, my friend," replied the count. "Go; I must be
alone." Morrel, subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy Monte Cristo
exercised over everything around him, did not endeavor to resist it. He
pressed the count's hand and left. He stopped one moment at the door for
Baptistin, whom he saw in the Rue Matignon, and who was running.</p>

<p id="id09595">Meanwhile, Villefort and d'Avrigny had made all possible haste,
Valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival, and
the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances
demanded, and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret
intensified twofold. Villefort, closely watching his countenance and his
lips, awaited the result of the examination. Noirtier, paler than even
the young girl, more eager than Villefort for the decision, was watching
also intently and affectionately. At last d'Avrigny slowly uttered these
words:&#8212;"she is still alive!"</p>

<p id="id09596">"Still?" cried Villefort; "oh, doctor, what a dreadful word is that."</p>

<p id="id09597">"Yes," said the physician, "I repeat it; she is still alive, and I am
astonished at it."</p>

<p id="id09598">"But is she safe?" asked the father.</p>

<p id="id09599">"Yes, since she lives." At that moment d'Avrigny's glance met Noirtier's
eye. It glistened with such extraordinary joy, so rich and full of
thought, that the physician was struck. He placed the young girl again
on the chair,&#8212;her lips were scarcely discernible, they were so pale and
white, as well as her whole face,&#8212;and remained motionless, looking at
Noirtier, who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did. "Sir,"
said d'Avrigny to Villefort, "call Mademoiselle Valentine's maid, if you
please." Villefort went himself to find her; and d'Avrigny approached
Noirtier. "Have you something to tell me?" asked he. The old man
winked his eyes expressively, which we may remember was his only way of
expressing his approval.</p>

<p id="id09600">"Privately?"</p>

<p id="id09601">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09602">"Well, I will remain with you." At this moment Villefort returned,
followed by the lady's maid; and after her came Madame de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id09603">"What is the matter, then, with this dear child? she has just left me,
and she complained of being indisposed, but I did not think seriously of
it." The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection
of a true mother, approached Valentine and took her hand. D'Avrigny
continued to look at Noirtier; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and
become round, his cheeks turn pale and tremble; the perspiration stood
in drops upon his forehead. "Ah," said he, involuntarily following
Noirtier's eyes, which were fixed on Madame de Villefort, who
repeated,&#8212;"This poor child would be better in bed. Come, Fanny, we
will put her to bed." M. d'Avrigny, who saw that would be a means of
his remaining alone with Noirtier, expressed his opinion that it was the
best thing that could be done; but he forbade that anything should be
given to her except what he ordered.</p>

<p id="id09604">They carried Valentine away; she had revived, but could scarcely move
or speak, so shaken was her frame by the attack. She had, however, just
power to give one parting look to her grandfather, who in losing her
seemed to be resigning his very soul. D'Avrigny followed the invalid,
wrote a prescription, ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet, go in
person to a chemist's to get the prescribed medicine, bring it himself,
and wait for him in his daughter's room. Then, having renewed his
injunction not to give Valentine anything, he went down again to
Noirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that
no one was listening,&#8212;"Do you," said he, "know anything of this young
lady's illness?"</p>

<p id="id09605">"Yes," said the old man.</p>

<p id="id09606">"We have no time to lose; I will question, and do you answer me."
Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer. "Did you anticipate
the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?"</p>

<p id="id09607">"Yes." D'Avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching Noirtier,&#8212;"Pardon
what I am going to say," added he, "but no indication should be
neglected in this terrible situation. Did you see poor Barrois die?"
Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven. "Do you know of what he died!" asked
d'Avrigny, placing his hand on Noirtier's shoulder.</p>

<p id="id09608">"Yes," replied the old man.</p>

<p id="id09609">"Do you think he died a natural death?" A sort of smile was discernible
on the motionless lips of Noirtier.</p>

<p id="id09610">"Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned?"</p>

<p id="id09611">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09612">"Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?"</p>

<p id="id09613">"No."</p>

<p id="id09614">"Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has now
attacked Valentine?"</p>

<p id="id09615">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09616">"Then will she die too?" asked d'Avrigny, fixing his penetrating gaze on
Noirtier. He watched the effect of this question on the old man. "No,"
replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most
clever diviner. "Then you hope?" said d'Avrigny, with surprise.</p>

<p id="id09617">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09618">"What do you hope?" The old man made him understand with his eyes that
he could not answer. "Ah, yes, it is true," murmured d'Avrigny. Then,
turning to Noirtier,&#8212;"Do you hope the assassin will be tried?"</p>

<p id="id09619">"No."</p>

<p id="id09620">"Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine?"</p>

<p id="id09621">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09622">"It is no news to you," added d'Avrigny, "to tell you that an
attempt has been made to poison her?" The old man made a sign that he
entertained no doubt upon the subject. "Then how do you hope Valentine
will escape?" Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same
spot. D'Avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a
bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning. "Ah, indeed?"
said d'Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, "has it occurred to
you"&#8212;Noirtier did not let him finish. "Yes," said he. "To prepare her
system to resist poison?"</p>

<p id="id09623">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09624">"By accustoming her by degrees"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09625">"Yes, yes, yes," said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.</p>

<p id="id09626">"Of course. I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give
you."</p>

<p id="id09627">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09628">"And by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to
neutralize the effect of a similar poison?" Noirtier's joy continued.
"And you have succeeded," exclaimed d'Avrigny. "Without that precaution
Valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.
The dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and
this time, at any rate, Valentine will not die." A superhuman joy
expanded the old man's eyes, which were raised towards heaven with an
expression of infinite gratitude. At this moment Villefort returned.
"Here, doctor," said he, "is what you sent me for."</p>

<p id="id09629">"Was this prepared in your presence?"</p>

<p id="id09630">"Yes," replied the procureur.</p>

<p id="id09631">"Have you not let it go out of your hands?"</p>

<p id="id09632">"No." D'Avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it
contained in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them. "Well," said
he, "let us go to Valentine; I will give instructions to every one, and
you, M. de Villefort, will yourself see that no one deviates from them."</p>

<p id="id09633">At the moment when d'Avrigny was returning to Valentine's room,
accompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and
calm and firm tone, hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of
M. de Villefort. No one knew how the three former tenants of that house
left it. About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be
unsafe; but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing
himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o'clock.
The lease was drawn up for three, six, or nine years by the new tenant,
who, according to the rule of the proprietor, paid six months in
advance. This new tenant, who, as we have said, was an Italian, was
called Il Signor Giacomo Busoni. Workmen were immediately called in,
and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with
surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower
part of the tottering house.</p>

<h2 id="id09634" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 95. Father and Daughter.</h2>

<p id="id09635">We saw in a preceding chapter how Madame Danglars went formally to
announce to Madame de Villefort the approaching marriage of Eugenie
Danglars and M. Andrea Cavalcanti. This announcement, which implied or
appeared to imply, the approval of all the persons concerned in this
momentous affair, had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must
be admitted. We beg them to take one step backward, and to transport
themselves, the morning of that day of great catastrophes, into the
showy, gilded salon we have before shown them, and which was the pride
of its owner, Baron Danglars. In this room, at about ten o'clock in the
morning, the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some
minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness, watching both doors, and
listening to every sound. When his patience was exhausted, he called his
valet. "Etienne," said he, "see why Mademoiselle Eugenie has asked me to
meet her in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so long."</p>

<p id="id09636">Having given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm;
Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with
her father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot. The
singularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a
little surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter
by repairing first to the drawing-room. Etienne soon returned from his
errand. "Mademoiselle's lady's maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is
finishing her toilette, and will be here shortly."</p>

<p id="id09637">Danglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied. To the world and to
his servants Danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and
the indulgent father. This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he
was performing,&#8212;a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as
well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen
from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed
lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper. Let us hasten to say that in
private the genial side descended to the level of the other, so that
generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal
husband and domineering father. "Why the devil does that foolish girl,
who pretends to wish to speak to me, not come into my study? and why on
earth does she want to speak to me at all?"</p>

<p id="id09638">He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time,
when the door opened and Eugenie appeared, attired in a figured black
satin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the
Italian Opera. "Well, Eugenie, what is it you want with me? and why in
this solemn drawing-room when the study is so comfortable?"</p>

<p id="id09639">"I quite understand why you ask, sir," said Eugenie, making a sign that
her father might be seated, "and in fact your two questions suggest
fully the theme of our conversation. I will answer them both, and
contrary to the usual method, the last first, because it is the least
difficult. I have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of meeting,
in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a
banker's study. Those gilded cashbooks, drawers locked like gates of
fortresses, heaps of bank-bills, come from I know not where, and the
quantities of letters from England, Holland, Spain, India, China, and
Peru, have generally a strange influence on a father's mind, and make
him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more
sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents. I have, therefore,
chosen this drawing-room, where you see, smiling and happy in their
magnificent frames, your portrait, mine, my mother's, and all sorts
of rural landscapes and touching pastorals. I rely much on external
impressions; perhaps, with regard to you, they are immaterial, but I
should be no artist if I had not some fancies."</p>

<p id="id09640">"Very well," replied M. Danglars, who had listened to all this preamble
with imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since
like every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with
seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.</p>

<p id="id09641">"There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so," said
Eugenie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine
pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; "and you
appear satisfied with the explanation. Now, let us return to the first.
You ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in two
words, sir; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id09642">Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards
heaven.</p>

<p id="id09643">"Yes, indeed, sir," continued Eugenie, still quite calm; "you are
astonished, I see; for since this little affair began, I have not
manifested the slightest opposition, and yet I am always sure, when the
opportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to people
who have not consulted me, and things which displease me. However, this
time, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded
from another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and
devoted daughter" (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of
the young girl), "to practice obedience."</p>

<p id="id09644">"Well?" asked Danglars.</p>

<p id="id09645">"Well, sir," replied Eugenie, "I have tried to the very last and now
that the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is
impossible."</p>

<p id="id09646">"But," said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed
with the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation
and force of will, "what is your reason for this refusal, Eugenie? what
reason do you assign?"</p>

<p id="id09647">"My reason?" replied the young girl. "Well, it is not that the man is
more ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any other; no,
M. Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men's faces and
figures as a very good specimen of his kind. It is not, either, that
my heart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a
schoolgirl's reason, which I consider quite beneath me. I actually love
no one, sir; you know it, do you not? I do not then see why, without
real necessity, I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion.
Has not some sage said, 'Nothing too much'? and another, 'I carry all my
effects with me'? I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in
Greek; one is, I believe, from Phaedrus, and the other from Bias.
Well, my dear father, in the shipwreck of life&#8212;for life is an eternal
shipwreck of our hopes&#8212;I cast into the sea my useless encumbrance, that
is all, and I remain with my own will, disposed to live perfectly alone,
and consequently perfectly free."</p>

<p id="id09648">"Unhappy girl, unhappy girl!" murmured Danglars, turning pale, for
he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so
suddenly encountered.</p>

<p id="id09649">"Unhappy girl," replied Eugenie, "unhappy girl, do you say, sir? No,
indeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected. Happy, on
the contrary, for what am I in want of! The world calls me beautiful.
It is something to be well received. I like a favorable reception; it
expands the countenance, and those around me do not then appear so ugly.
I possess a share of wit, and a certain relative sensibility, which
enables me to draw from life in general, for the support of mine, all I
meet with that is good, like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its
contents. I am rich, for you have one of the first fortunes in France. I
am your only daughter, and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the
Porte Saint-Martin and Gaiete, who disinherit their daughters for not
giving them grandchildren. Besides, the provident law has deprived you
of the power to disinherit me, at least entirely, as it has also of
the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur That. And
so&#8212;being, beautiful, witty, somewhat talented, as the comic operas say,
and rich&#8212;and that is happiness, sir&#8212;why do you call me unhappy?"</p>

<p id="id09650">Danglars, seeing his daughter smiling, and proud even to insolence,
could not entirely repress his brutal feelings, but they betrayed
themselves only by an exclamation. Under the fixed and inquiring gaze
levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows, he prudently
turned away, and calmed himself immediately, daunted by the power of a
resolute mind. "Truly, my daughter," replied he with a smile, "you are
all you boast of being, excepting one thing; I will not too hastily tell
you which, but would rather leave you to guess it." Eugenie looked at
Danglars, much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride, with
which she had so superbly decked herself, should be disputed. "My
daughter," continued the banker, "you have perfectly explained to me the
sentiments which influence a girl like you, who is determined she will
not marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father
like me, who has decided that his daughter shall marry." Eugenie
bowed, not as a submissive daughter, but as an adversary prepared for a
discussion.</p>

<p id="id09651">"My daughter," continued Danglars, "when a father asks his daughter to
choose a husband, he has always some reason for wishing her to marry.
Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now, that of
living again in their grandchildren. This is not my weakness, I tell you
at once; family joys have no charm for me. I may acknowledge this to
a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my
indifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime."</p>

<p id="id09652">"This is not to the purpose," said Eugenie; "let us speak candidly, sir;<br/>

I admire candor."<br/></p>

<p id="id09653">"Oh," said Danglars, "I can, when circumstances render it desirable,
adopt your system, although it may not be my general practice. I will
therefore proceed. I have proposed to you to marry, not for your sake,
for indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment (you admire
candor, and will now be satisfied, I hope); but because it suited me
to marry you as soon as possible, on account of certain commercial
speculations I am desirous of entering into." Eugenie became uneasy.</p>

<p id="id09654">"It is just as I tell you, I assure you, and you must not be angry with
me, for you have sought this disclosure. I do not willingly enter into
arithmetical explanations with an artist like you, who fears to enter my
study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti-poetic impressions and
sensations. But in that same banker's study, where you very willingly
presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you
monthly for pocket-money, you must know, my dear young lady, that many
things may be learned, useful even to a girl who will not marry.
There one may learn, for instance, what, out of regard to your nervous
susceptibility, I will inform you of in the drawing-room, namely, that
the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life; that credit
sustains him as breath animates the body; and M. de Monte Cristo once
gave me a lecture on that subject, which I have never forgotten. There
we may learn that as credit sinks, the body becomes a corpse, and this
is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good
a logician as you for his daughter." But Eugenie, instead of stooping,
drew herself up under the blow. "Ruined?" said she.</p>

<p id="id09655">"Exactly, my daughter; that is precisely what I mean," said Danglars,
almost digging his nails into his breast, while he preserved on
his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man;
"ruined&#8212;yes, that is it."</p>

<p id="id09656">"Ah!" said Eugenie.</p>

<p id="id09657">"Yes, ruined! Now it is revealed, this secret so full of horror, as
the tragic poet says. Now, my daughter, learn from my lips how you may
alleviate this misfortune, so far as it will affect you."</p>

<p id="id09658">"Oh," cried Eugenie, "you are a bad physiognomist, if you imagine
I deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me. I
ruined? and what will that signify to me? Have I not my talent left? Can
I not, like Pasta, Malibran, Grisi, acquire for myself what you would
never have given me, whatever might have been your fortune, a hundred
or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum, for which I shall be
indebted to no one but myself; and which, instead of being given as
you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs, with sour looks and
reproaches for my prodigality, will be accompanied with acclamations,
with bravos, and with flowers? And if I do not possess that talent,
which your smiles prove to me you doubt, should I not still have that
ardent love of independence, which will be a substitute for wealth, and
which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self-preservation?
No, I grieve not on my own account, I shall always find a resource; my
books, my pencils, my piano, all the things which cost but little, and
which I shall be able to procure, will remain my own.</p>
