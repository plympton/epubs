<p id="id02600">"Perhaps she has spoken to the Pharaon, and brings you some tidings of
her?"</p>

<p id="id02601">"Shall I tell you plainly one thing, sir? I dread almost as much to
receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt. Uncertainty
is still hope." Then in a low voice Morrel added,&#8212;"This delay is not
natural. The Pharaon left Calcutta the 5th February; she ought to have
been here a month ago."</p>

<p id="id02602">"What is that?" said the Englishman. "What is the meaning of that
noise?"</p>

<p id="id02603">"Oh, oh!" cried Morrel, turning pale, "what is it?" A loud noise was
heard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and half-stifled sobs.
Morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his strength failed him and
he sank into a chair. The two men remained opposite one another, Morrel
trembling in every limb, the stranger gazing at him with an air of
profound pity. The noise had ceased; but it seemed that Morrel expected
something&#8212;something had occasioned the noise, and something must
follow. The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and that
the footsteps, which were those of several persons, stopped at the door.
A key was inserted in the lock of the first door, and the creaking of
hinges was audible.</p>

<p id="id02604">"There are only two persons who have the key to that door," murmured
Morrel, "Cocles and Julie." At this instant the second door opened,
and the young girl, her eyes bathed with tears, appeared. Morrel rose
tremblingly, supporting himself by the arm of the chair. He would have
spoken, but his voice failed him. "Oh, father!" said she, clasping her
hands, "forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings."</p>

<p id="id02605">Morrel again changed color. Julie threw herself into his arms.</p>

<p id="id02606">"Oh, father, father!" murmured she, "courage!"</p>

<p id="id02607">"The Pharaon has gone down, then?" said Morrel in a hoarse voice. The
young girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative sign with her head
as she lay on her father's breast.</p>

<p id="id02608">"And the crew?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02609">"Saved," said the girl; "saved by the crew of the vessel that has just
entered the harbor." Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an
expression of resignation and sublime gratitude. "Thanks, my God," said
he, "at least thou strikest but me alone." A tear moistened the eye of
the phlegmatic Englishman.</p>

<p id="id02610">"Come in, come in," said Morrel, "for I presume you are all at the
door."</p>

<p id="id02611">Scarcely had he uttered those words than Madame Morrel entered weeping
bitterly. Emmanuel followed her, and in the antechamber were visible the
rough faces of seven or eight half-naked sailors. At the sight of these
men the Englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained himself,
and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment.
Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers,
Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder, Emmanuel stood in the
centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrel's
family and the sailors at the door.</p>

<p id="id02612">"How did this happen?" said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02613">"Draw nearer, Penelon," said the young man, "and tell us all about it."</p>

<p id="id02614">An old seaman, bronzed by the tropical sun, advanced, twirling the
remains of a tarpaulin between his hands. "Good-day, M. Morrel," said
he, as if he had just quitted Marseilles the previous evening, and had
just returned from Aix or Toulon.</p>

<p id="id02615">"Good-day, Penelon," returned Morrel, who could not refrain from smiling
through his tears, "where is the captain?"</p>

<p id="id02616">"The captain, M. Morrel,&#8212;he has stayed behind sick at Palma; but please
God, it won't be much, and you will see him in a few days all alive and
hearty."</p>

<p id="id02617">"Well, now tell your story, Penelon."</p>

<p id="id02618">Penelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his
mouth, turned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the
antechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began,&#8212;"You see,
M. Morrel," said he, "we were somewhere between Cape Blanc and Cape
Boyador, sailing with a fair breeze, south-south-west after a week's
calm, when Captain Gaumard comes up to me&#8212;I was at the helm I should
tell you&#8212;and says, 'Penelon, what do you think of those clouds coming
up over there?' I was just then looking at them myself. 'What do I
think, captain? Why I think that they are rising faster than they have
any business to do, and that they would not be so black if they didn't
mean mischief.'&#8212;'That's my opinion too,' said the captain, 'and I'll
take precautions accordingly. We are carrying too much canvas. Avast,
there, all hands! Take in the studding-sl's and stow the flying jib.' It
was time; the squall was on us, and the vessel began to heel. 'Ah,' said
the captain, 'we have still too much canvas set; all hands lower
the mains'l!' Five minutes after, it was down; and we sailed under
mizzen-tops'ls and to'gall'nt sails. 'Well, Penelon,' said the captain,
'what makes you shake your head?' 'Why,' I says, 'I still think you've
got too much on.' 'I think you're right,' answered he, 'we shall have a
gale.' 'A gale? More than that, we shall have a tempest, or I don't know
what's what.' You could see the wind coming like the dust at Montredon;
luckily the captain understood his business. 'Take in two reefs in the
tops'ls,' cried the captain; 'let go the bowlin's, haul the brace, lower
the to'gall'nt sails, haul out the reef-tackles on the yards.'"</p>

<p id="id02619">"That was not enough for those latitudes," said the Englishman; "I
should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker."</p>

<p id="id02620">His firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made every one start. Penelon
put his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus
criticized the manoeuvres of his captain. "We did better than that,
sir," said the old sailor respectfully; "we put the helm up to run
before the tempest; ten minutes after we struck our tops'ls and scudded
under bare poles."</p>

<p id="id02621">"The vessel was very old to risk that," said the Englishman.</p>

<p id="id02622">"Eh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for
twelve hours we sprung a leak. 'Penelon,' said the captain, 'I think we
are sinking, give me the helm, and go down into the hold.' I gave him
the helm, and descended; there was already three feet of water. 'All
hands to the pumps!' I shouted; but it was too late, and it seemed the
more we pumped the more came in. 'Ah,' said I, after four hours' work,
'since we are sinking, let us sink; we can die but once.' 'That's
the example you set, Penelon,' cries the captain; 'very well, wait a
minute.' He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols.
'I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump,' said
he."</p>

<p id="id02623">"Well done!" said the Englishman.</p>

<p id="id02624">"There's nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons," continued
the sailor; "and during that time the wind had abated, and the sea gone
down, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an hour,
but still it rose. Two inches an hour does not seem much, but in twelve
hours that makes two feet, and three we had before, that makes five.
'Come,' said the captain, 'we have done all in our power, and M. Morrel
will have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried to save the ship,
let us now save ourselves. To the boats, my lads, as quick as you can.'
Now," continued Penelon, "you see, M. Morrel, a sailor is attached to
his ship, but still more to his life, so we did not wait to be told
twice; the more so, that the ship was sinking under us, and seemed to
say, 'Get along&#8212;save yourselves.' We soon launched the boat, and all
eight of us got into it. The captain descended last, or rather, he
did not descend, he would not quit the vessel; so I took him round the
waist, and threw him into the boat, and then I jumped after him. It
was time, for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the
broadside of a man-of-war. Ten minutes after she pitched forward, then
the other way, spun round and round, and then good-by to the Pharaon. As
for us, we were three days without anything to eat or drink, so that we
began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest, when we saw La
Gironde; we made signals of distress, she perceived us, made for us, and
took us all on board. There now, M. Morrel, that's the whole truth, on
the honor of a sailor; is not it true, you fellows there?" A general
murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed
their misfortunes and sufferings.</p>

<p id="id02625">"Well, well," said M. Morrel, "I know there was no one in fault but
destiny. It was the will of God that this should happen, blessed be his
name. What wages are due to you?"</p>

<p id="id02626">"Oh, don't let us talk of that, M. Morrel."</p>

<p id="id02627">"Yes, but we will talk of it."</p>

<p id="id02628">"Well, then, three months," said Penelon.</p>

<p id="id02629">"Cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows," said
Morrel. "At another time," added he, "I should have said, Give them,
besides, two hundred francs over as a present; but times are changed,
and the little money that remains to me is not my own."</p>

<p id="id02630">Penelon turned to his companions, and exchanged a few words with them.</p>

<p id="id02631">"As for that, M. Morrel," said he, again turning his quid, "as for
that"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id02632">"As for what?"</p>

<p id="id02633">"The money."</p>

<p id="id02634">"Well"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id02635">"Well, we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present,
and that we will wait for the rest."</p>

<p id="id02636">"Thanks, my friends, thanks!" cried Morrel gratefully; "take it&#8212;take
it; and if you can find another employer, enter his service; you are
free to do so." These last words produced a prodigious effect on the
seaman. Penelon nearly swallowed his quid; fortunately he recovered.
"What, M. Morrel!" said he in a low voice, "you send us away; you are
then angry with us!"</p>

<p id="id02637">"No, no," said M. Morrel, "I am not angry, quite the contrary, and I do
not send you away; but I have no more ships, and therefore I do not want
any sailors."</p>

<p id="id02638">"No more ships!" returned Penelon; "well, then, you'll build some; we'll
wait for you."</p>

<p id="id02639">"I have no money to build ships with, Penelon," said the poor owner
mournfully, "so I cannot accept your kind offer."</p>

<p id="id02640">"No more money? Then you must not pay us; we can scud, like the Pharaon,
under bare poles."</p>

<p id="id02641">"Enough, enough!" cried Morrel, almost overpowered; "leave me, I pray
you; we shall meet again in a happier time. Emmanuel, go with them, and
see that my orders are executed."</p>

<p id="id02642">"At least, we shall see each other again, M. Morrel?" asked Penelon.</p>

<p id="id02643">"Yes; I hope so, at least. Now go." He made a sign to Cocles, who went
first; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear. "Now,"
said the owner to his wife and daughter, "leave me; I wish to speak with
this gentleman." And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson &amp; French,
who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene, in which he
had taken no part, except the few words we have mentioned. The two women
looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten, and
retired; but, as she left the apartment, Julie gave the stranger a
supplicating glance, to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent
spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features. The
two men were left alone. "Well, sir," said Morrel, sinking into a chair,
"you have heard all, and I have nothing further to tell you."</p>

<p id="id02644">"I see," returned the Englishman, "that a fresh and unmerited misfortune
his overwhelmed you, and this only increases my desire to serve you."</p>

<p id="id02645">"Oh, sir!" cried Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02646">"Let me see," continued the stranger, "I am one of your largest
creditors."</p>

<p id="id02647">"Your bills, at least, are the first that will fall due."</p>

<p id="id02648">"Do you wish for time to pay?"</p>

<p id="id02649">"A delay would save my honor, and consequently my life."</p>

<p id="id02650">"How long a delay do you wish for?"&#8212;Morrel reflected. "Two months,"
said he.</p>

<p id="id02651">"I will give you three," replied the stranger.</p>

<p id="id02652">"But," asked Morrel, "will the house of Thomson &amp; French consent?"</p>

<p id="id02653">"Oh, I take everything on myself. To-day is the 5th of June."</p>

<p id="id02654">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id02655">"Well, renew these bills up to the 5th of September; and on the 5th of
September at eleven o'clock (the hand of the clock pointed to eleven), I
shall come to receive the money."</p>

<p id="id02656">"I shall expect you," returned Morrel; "and I will pay you&#8212;or I shall
be dead." These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the
stranger could not hear them. The bills were renewed, the old ones
destroyed, and the poor ship-owner found himself with three months
before him to collect his resources. The Englishman received his thanks
with the phlegm peculiar to his nation; and Morrel, overwhelming him
with grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase. The stranger
met Julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending, but in reality
she was waiting for him. "Oh, sir"&#8212;said she, clasping her hands.</p>

<p id="id02657">"Mademoiselle," said the stranger, "one day you will receive a letter
signed 'Sinbad the Sailor.' Do exactly what the letter bids you, however
strange it may appear."</p>

<p id="id02658">"Yes, sir," returned Julie.</p>

<p id="id02659">"Do you promise?"</p>

<p id="id02660">"I swear to you I will."</p>

<p id="id02661">"It is well. Adieu, mademoiselle. Continue to be the good, sweet girl
you are at present, and I have great hopes that heaven will reward you
by giving you Emmanuel for a husband."</p>

<p id="id02662">Julie uttered a faint cry, blushed like a rose, and leaned against the
baluster. The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend. In
the court he found Penelon, who, with a rouleau of a hundred francs in
either hand, seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them. "Come
with me, my friend," said the Englishman; "I wish to speak to you."</p>

<h2 id="id02663" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 30. The Fifth of September.</h2>

<p id="id02664">The extension provided for by the agent of Thomson &amp; French, at the
moment when Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so
decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that
fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him. The same
day he told his wife, Emmanuel, and his daughter all that had occurred;
and a ray of hope, if not of tranquillity, returned to the family.
Unfortunately, however, Morrel had not only engagements with the house
of Thomson &amp; French, who had shown themselves so considerate towards
him; and, as he had said, in business he had correspondents, and not
friends. When he thought the matter over, he could by no means account
for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson &amp; French towards him;
and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this:&#8212;"We
had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those
300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin, and
get only six or eight per cent of our money back again." Unfortunately,
whether through envy or stupidity, all Morrel's correspondents did not
take this view; and some even came to a contrary decision. The
bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous
exactitude, and, thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman, were
paid by Cocles with equal punctuality. Cocles thus remained in his
accustomed tranquillity. It was Morrel alone who remembered with alarm,
that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50,000 francs of M. de Boville,
and on the 30th the 32,500 francs of bills, for which, as well as the
debt due to the inspector of prisons, he had time granted, he must be a
ruined man.</p>

<p id="id02665">The opinion of all the commercial men was that, under the reverses
which had successively weighed down Morrel, it was impossible for him to
remain solvent. Great, therefore, was the astonishment when at the
end of the month, he cancelled all his obligations with his usual
punctuality. Still confidence was not restored to all minds, and the
general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner
had been postponed only until the end of the month. The month passed,
and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources.
Formerly his paper, at any date, was taken with confidence, and was even
in request. Morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only, and
none of the banks would give him credit. Fortunately, Morrel had some
funds coming in on which he could rely; and, as they reached him, he
found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of
July came. The agent of Thomson &amp; French had not been again seen at
Marseilles; the day after, or two days after his visit to Morrel, he had
disappeared; and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the
mayor, the inspector of prisons, and M. Morrel, his departure left no
trace except in the memories of these three persons. As to the sailors
of the Pharaon, they must have found snug berths elsewhere, for they
also had disappeared.</p>

<p id="id02666">Captain Gaumard, recovered from his illness, had returned from Palma.
He delayed presenting himself at Morrel's, but the owner, hearing of
his arrival, went to see him. The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelon's
recital, of the captain's brave conduct during the storm, and tried to
console him. He brought him also the amount of his wages, which Captain
Gaumard had not dared to apply for. As he descended the staircase,
Morrel met Penelon, who was going up. Penelon had, it would seem, made
good use of his money, for he was newly clad. When he saw his employer,
the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed, drew on one side into the corner
of the landing-place, passed his quid from one cheek to the other,
stared stupidly with his great eyes, and only acknowledged the squeeze
of the hand which Morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in
return. Morrel attributed Penelon's embarrassment to the elegance of his
attire; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense
on his own account; he was, no doubt, engaged on board some other
vessel, and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having,
if we may so express ourselves, worn mourning for the Pharaon longer.
Perhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to
offer him employment from his new master. "Worthy fellows!" said Morrel,
as he went away, "may your new master love you as I loved you, and be
more fortunate than I have been!"</p>

<p id="id02667">August rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew
his credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at
Marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said
that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that
Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier
Cocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when
the 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared
behind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with
the usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual
precision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had fully
anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the
shipowner had accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and then, with
the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure was put off
until the end of September. On the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited
by his family with extreme anxiety, for from this journey to Paris
they hoped great things. Morrel had thought of Danglars, who was now
immensely rich, and had lain under great obligations to Morrel in former
days, since to him it was owing that Danglars entered the service of
the Spanish banker, with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast
wealth. It was said at this moment that Danglars was worth from six
to eight millions of francs, and had unlimited credit. Danglars, then,
without taking a crown from his pocket, could save Morrel; he had but to
pass his word for a loan, and Morrel was saved. Morrel had long thought
of Danglars, but had kept away from some instinctive motive, and had
delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource. And
Morrel was right, for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a
refusal. Yet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or
say one harsh word. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed
Emmanuel's hand with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room
on the second floor had sent for Cocles. "Then," said the two women to
Emmanuel, "we are indeed ruined."</p>

<p id="id02668">It was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should
write to her brother, who was in garrison at Nimes, to come to them
as speedily as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they
required all their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides,
Maximilian Morrel, though hardly two and twenty, had great influence
over his father. He was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time
when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for
him, but had consulted young Maximilian's taste. He had at once declared
for a military life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed
brilliantly through the Polytechnic School, and left it as
sub-lieutenant of the 53d of the line. For a year he had held this rank,
and expected promotion on the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian
Morrel was noted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations
imposed on a soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus
gained the name of "the stoic." We need hardly say that many of those
who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did
not even know what it meant. This was the young man whom his mother and
sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which
they felt they would soon have to endure. They had not mistaken the
gravity of this event, for the moment after Morrel had entered his
private office with Cocles, Julie saw the latter leave it pale,
trembling, and his features betraying the utmost consternation. She
would have questioned him as he passed by her, but the worthy creature
hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation, and only raised
his hands to heaven and exclaimed, "Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle,
what a dreadful misfortune! Who could ever have believed it!" A moment
afterwards Julie saw him go up-stairs carrying two or three heavy
ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.</p>

<p id="id02669">Morrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the
money. All his funds amounted to 6,000, or 8,000. francs, his bills
receivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of
everything, gave him 14,000. francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500
francs. He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on
account. However, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very
calm. This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest
dejection would have been. After dinner Morrel usually went out and used
to take his coffee at the Phocaean club, and read the Semaphore; this
day he did not leave the house, but returned to his office.</p>

<p id="id02670">As to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he
went into the court-yard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare
and exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women, but
his eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with the
business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over
the Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping that
when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard him pass
before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps.
They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened the door
inside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an hour after
Julie had retired, she rose, took off her shoes, and went stealthily
along the passage, to see through the keyhole what her husband was
doing. In the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who,
uneasy herself, had anticipated her mother. The young lady went towards
Madame Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02671">"He is writing," she said. They had understood each other without
speaking. Madame Morrel looked again through the keyhole, Morrel was
writing; but Madame Morrel remarked, what her daughter had not observed,
that her husband was writing on stamped paper. The terrible idea that he
was writing his will flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet had not
strength to utter a word. Next day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever,
went into his office as usual, came to his breakfast punctually, and
then, after dinner, he placed his daughter beside him, took her head
in his arms, and held her for a long time against his bosom. In the
evening, Julie told her mother, that although he was apparently so calm,
she had noticed that her father's heart beat violently. The next
two days passed in much the same way. On the evening of the 4th of
September, M. Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study. Julie
trembled at this request, which seemed to her of bad omen. Why did her
father ask for this key which she always kept, and which was only taken
from her in childhood as a punishment? The young girl looked at Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02672">"What have I done wrong, father," she said, "that you should take this
key from me?"</p>

<p id="id02673">"Nothing, my dear," replied the unhappy man, the tears starting to his
eyes at this simple question,&#8212;"nothing, only I want it." Julie made
a pretence to feel for the key. "I must have left it in my room,"
she said. And she went out, but instead of going to her apartment she
hastened to consult Emmanuel. "Do not give this key to your father,"
said he, "and to-morrow morning, if possible, do not quit him for a
moment." She questioned Emmanuel, but he knew nothing, or would not say
what he knew. During the night, between the 4th and 5th of September,
Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound, and, until three
o'clock in the morning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great
agitation. It was three o'clock when he threw himself on the bed.
The mother and daughter passed the night together. They had expected
Maximilian since the previous evening. At eight o'clock in the morning
Morrel entered their chamber. He was calm; but the agitation of the
night was legible in his pale and careworn visage. They did not dare
to ask him how he had slept. Morrel was kinder to his wife, more
affectionate to his daughter, than he had ever been. He could not cease
gazing at and kissing the sweet girl. Julie, mindful of Emmanuel's
request, was following her father when he quitted the room, but he said
to her quickly,&#8212;"Remain with your mother, dearest." Julie wished to
accompany him. "I wish you to do so," said he.</p>

<p id="id02674">This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in
a tone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey. She
remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless. An instant
afterwards the door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth
pressed her forehead. She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy.</p>

<p id="id02675">"Maximilian, my dearest brother!" she cried. At these words Madame
Morrel rose, and threw herself into her son's arms. "Mother," said the
young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter, "what
has occurred&#8212;what has happened? Your letter has frightened me, and I
have come hither with all speed."</p>

<p id="id02676">"Julie," said Madame Morrel, making a sign to the young man, "go and
tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived." The young lady
rushed out of the apartment, but on the first step of the staircase she
found a man holding a letter in his hand.</p>

<p id="id02677">"Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?" inquired the man, with a strong<br>

Italian accent.<br></p>

<p id="id02678">"Yes, sir," replied Julie with hesitation; "what is your pleasure? I do
not know you."</p>

<p id="id02679">"Read this letter," he said, handing it to her. Julie hesitated. "It
concerns the best interests of your father," said the messenger.</p>

<p id="id02680">The young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly
and read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id02681">"Go this moment to the Allees de Meillan, enter the house No. 15,
ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the
apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red
silk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should receive
it before eleven o'clock. You promised to obey me implicitly. Remember
your oath.</p>

<p id="id02682">"Sinbad the Sailor."</p>

<p id="id02683">The young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to
question the messenger, but he had disappeared. She cast her eyes
again over the note to peruse it a second time, and saw there was a
postscript. She read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id02684">"It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and
alone. If you go accompanied by any other person, or should any one else
go in your place, the porter will reply that he does not know anything
about it."</p>

<p id="id02685">This postscript decreased greatly the young girl's happiness. Was there
nothing to fear? was there not some snare laid for her? Her innocence
had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl
of her age. But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it;
indeed, it may be observed, that it is usually unknown perils that
inspire the greatest terror.</p>

<p id="id02686">Julie hesitated, and resolved to take counsel. Yet, through a singular
impulse, it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied,
but to Emmanuel. She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the
day when the agent of Thomson &amp; French had come to her father's, related
the scene on the staircase, repeated the promise she had made, and
showed him the letter. "You must go, then, mademoiselle," said Emmanuel.</p>

<p id="id02687">"Go there?" murmured Julie.</p>

<p id="id02688">"Yes; I will accompany you."</p>

<p id="id02689">"But did you not read that I must be alone?" said Julie.</p>

<p id="id02690">"And you shall be alone," replied the young man. "I will await you at
the corner of the Rue de Musee, and if you are so long absent as to make
me uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom you shall
have cause to complain to me!"</p>

<p id="id02691">"Then, Emmanuel?" said the young girl with hesitation, "it is your
opinion that I should obey this invitation?"</p>

<p id="id02692">"Yes. Did not the messenger say your father's safety depended upon it?"</p>

<p id="id02693">"But what danger threatens him, then, Emmanuel?" she asked.</p>

<p id="id02694">Emmanuel hesitated a moment, but his desire to make Julie decide
immediately made him reply.</p>

<p id="id02695">"Listen," he said; "to-day is the 5th of September, is it not?"</p>

<p id="id02696">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id02697">"To-day, then, at eleven o'clock, your father has nearly three hundred
thousand francs to pay?"</p>

<p id="id02698">"Yes, we know that."</p>

<p id="id02699">"Well, then," continued Emmanuel, "we have not fifteen thousand francs
in the house."</p>

<p id="id02700">"What will happen then?"</p>

<p id="id02701">"Why, if to-day before eleven o'clock your father has not found someone
who will come to his aid, he will be compelled at twelve o'clock to
declare himself a bankrupt."</p>

<p id="id02702">"Oh, come, then, come!" cried she, hastening away with the young man.
During this time, Madame Morrel had told her son everything. The young
man knew quite well that, after the succession of misfortunes which
had befallen his father, great changes had taken place in the style of
living and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached
such a point. He was thunderstruck. Then, rushing hastily out of the
apartment, he ran up-stairs, expecting to find his father in his study,
but he rapped there in vain.</p>

<p id="id02703">While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door
open, turned, and saw his father. Instead of going direct to his study,
M. Morrel had returned to his bed-chamber, which he was only this moment
quitting. Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son,
of whose arrival he was ignorant. He remained motionless on the spot,
pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat.
Maximilian sprang down the staircase, and threw his arms round his
father's neck; but suddenly he recoiled, and placed his right hand on
Morrel's breast. "Father," he exclaimed, turning pale as death, "what
are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat?"</p>

<p id="id02704">"Oh, this is what I feared!" said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02705">"Father, father, in heaven's name," exclaimed the young man, "what are
these weapons for?"</p>

<p id="id02706">"Maximilian," replied Morrel, looking fixedly at his son, "you are a
man, and a man of honor. Come, and I will explain to you."</p>

<p id="id02707">And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian
followed him, trembling as he went. Morrel opened the door, and closed
it behind his son; then, crossing the anteroom, went to his desk on
which he placed the pistols, and pointed with his finger to an open
ledger. In this ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his
affair's. Morrel had to pay, within half an hour, 287,500 francs. All he
possessed was 15,257 francs. "Read!" said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02708">The young man was overwhelmed as he read. Morrel said not a word. What
could he say? What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?"
And have you done all that is possible, father, to meet this disastrous
result?" asked the young man, after a moment's pause. "I have," replied
Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02709">"You have no money coming in on which you can rely?"</p>

<p id="id02710">"None."</p>

<p id="id02711">"You have exhausted every resource?"</p>

<p id="id02712">"All."</p>

<p id="id02713">"And in half an hour," said Maximilian in a gloomy voice, "our name is
dishonored!"</p>

<p id="id02714">"Blood washes out dishonor," said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id02715">"You are right, father; I understand you." Then extending his hand
towards one of the pistols, he said, "There is one for you and one for
me&#8212;thanks!" Morrel caught his hand. "Your mother&#8212;your sister! Who will
support them?" A shudder ran through the young man's frame. "Father," he
said, "do you reflect that you are bidding me to live?"</p>

<p id="id02716">"Yes, I do so bid you," answered Morrel, "it is your duty. You have a
calm, strong mind, Maximilian. Maximilian, you are no ordinary man. I
make no requests or commands; I only ask you to examine my position as
if it were your own, and then judge for yourself."</p>

<p id="id02717">The young man reflected for a moment, then an expression of sublime
resignation appeared in his eyes, and with a slow and sad gesture he
took off his two epaulets, the insignia of his rank. "Be it so, then,
my father," he said, extending his hand to Morrel, "die in peace, my
father; I will live." Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees
before his son, but Maximilian caught him in his arms, and those two
noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment. "You know it
is not my fault," said Morrel. Maximilian smiled. "I know, father, you
are the most honorable man I have ever known."</p>

<p id="id02718">"Good, my son. And now there is no more to be said; go and rejoin your
mother and sister."</p>

<p id="id02719">"My father," said the young man, bending his knee, "bless me!" Morrel
took the head of his son between his two hands, drew him forward, and
kissing his forehead several times said, "Oh, yes, yes, I bless you in
my own name, and in the name of three generations of irreproachable
men, who say through me, 'The edifice which misfortune has destroyed,
providence may build up again.' On seeing me die such a death, the most
inexorable will have pity on you. To you, perhaps, they will accord the
time they have refused to me. Then do your best to keep our name free
from dishonor. Go to work, labor, young man, struggle ardently and
courageously; live, yourself, your mother and sister, with the most
rigid economy, so that from day to day the property of those whom I
leave in your hands may augment and fructify. Reflect how glorious a day
it will be, how grand, how solemn, that day of complete restoration, on
which you will say in this very office, 'My father died because he could
not do what I have this day done; but he died calmly and peaceably,
because in dying he knew what I should do.'"</p>

<p id="id02720">"My father, my father!" cried the young man, "why should you not live?"</p>

<p id="id02721">"If I live, all would be changed; if I live, interest would be converted
into doubt, pity into hostility; if I live I am only a man who his
broken his word, failed in his engagements&#8212;in fact, only a bankrupt.
If, on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse is that of
an honest but unfortunate man. Living, my best friends would avoid my
house; dead, all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home.
Living, you would feel shame at my name; dead, you may raise your head
and say, 'I am the son of him you killed, because, for the first time,
he has been compelled to break his word.'"</p>

<p id="id02722">The young man uttered a groan, but appeared resigned.</p>

<p id="id02723">"And now," said Morrel, "leave me alone, and endeavor to keep your
mother and sister away."</p>

<p id="id02724">"Will you not see my sister once more?" asked Maximilian. A last
but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this
interview, and therefore he had suggested it. Morrel shook his head. "I
saw her this morning, and bade her adieu."</p>

<p id="id02725">"Have you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?" inquired<br>

Maximilian in a faltering voice.<br></p>

<p id="id02726">"Yes; my son, and a sacred command."</p>

<p id="id02727">"Say it, my father."</p>

<p id="id02728">"The house of Thomson &amp; French is the only one who, from humanity, or,
it may be, selfishness&#8212;it is not for me to read men's hearts&#8212;has had
any pity for me. Its agent, who will in ten minutes present himself to
receive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs, I will not say granted,
but offered me three months. Let this house be the first repaid, my son,
and respect this man."</p>

<p id="id02729">"Father, I will," said Maximilian.</p>

<p id="id02730">"And now, once more, adieu," said Morrel. "Go, leave me; I would be
alone. You will find my will in the secretary in my bedroom."</p>

<p id="id02731">The young man remained standing and motionless, having but the force of
will and not the power of execution.</p>

<p id="id02732">"Hear me, Maximilian," said his father. "Suppose I was a soldier like
you, and ordered to carry a certain redoubt, and you knew I must be
killed in the assault, would you not say to me, as you said just now,
'Go, father; for you are dishonored by delay, and death is preferable to
shame!'"</p>

<p id="id02733">"Yes, yes," said the young man, "yes;" and once again embracing his
father with convulsive pressure, he said, "Be it so, my father."</p>

<p id="id02734">And he rushed out of the study. When his son had left him, Morrel
remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door; then
putting forth his arm, he pulled the bell. After a moment's interval,
Cocles appeared.</p>

<p id="id02735">It was no longer the same man&#8212;the fearful revelations of the three last
days had crushed him. This thought&#8212;the house of Morrel is about to stop
payment&#8212;bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise
have done.</p>

<p id="id02736">"My worthy Cocles," said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe, "do
you remain in the ante-chamber. When the gentleman who came three months
ago&#8212;the agent of Thomson &amp; French&#8212;arrives, announce his arrival to
me." Cocles made no reply; he made a sign with his head, went into the
anteroom, and seated himself. Morrel fell back in his chair, his eyes
fixed on the clock; there were seven minutes left, that was all. The
hand moved on with incredible rapidity, he seemed to see its motion.</p>

<p id="id02737">What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony
cannot be told in words. He was still comparatively young, he was
surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family, but he had convinced
himself by a course of reasoning, illogical perhaps, yet certainly
plausible, that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the
world, even life itself. To form the slightest idea of his feelings, one
must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and
its tear-moistened eyes raised to heaven. The minute hand moved on.
The pistols were loaded; he stretched forth his hand, took one up, and
murmured his daughter's name. Then he laid it down seized his pen, and
wrote a few words. It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient
farewell of his beloved daughter. Then he turned again to the clock,
counting time now not by minutes, but by seconds. He took up the deadly
weapon again, his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock, and then
shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol. At this
moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow, a pang
stronger than death clutched at his heart-strings. He heard the door of
the staircase creak on its hinges&#8212;the clock gave its warning to strike
eleven&#8212;the door of his study opened; Morrel did not turn round&#8212;he
expected these words of Cocles, "The agent of Thomson &amp; French."</p>

<p id="id02738">He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth. Suddenly he heard
a cry&#8212;it was his daughter's voice. He turned and saw Julie. The pistol
fell from his hands. "My father!" cried the young girl, out of breath,
and half dead with joy&#8212;"saved, you are saved!" And she threw herself
into his arms, holding in her extended hand a red, netted silk purse.</p>

<p id="id02739">"Saved, my child!" said Morrel; "what do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id02740">"Yes, saved&#8212;saved! See, see!" said the young girl.</p>

<p id="id02741">Morrel took the purse, and started as he did so, for a vague remembrance
reminded him that it once belonged to himself. At one end was the
receipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a diamond
as large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of
parchment:&#8212;Julie's Dowry.</p>

<p id="id02742">Morrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream. At this
moment the clock struck eleven. He felt as if each stroke of the hammer
fell upon his heart. "Explain, my child," he said, "Explain, my child,"
he said, "explain&#8212;where did you find this purse?"</p>

<p id="id02743">"In a house in the Allees de Meillan, No. 15, on the corner of a
mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor."</p>

<p id="id02744">"But," cried Morrel, "this purse is not yours!" Julie handed to her
father the letter she had received in the morning.</p>

<p id="id02745">"And did you go alone?" asked Morrel, after he had read it.</p>

<p id="id02746">"Emmanuel accompanied me, father. He was to have waited for me at the
corner of the Rue de Musee, but, strange to say, he was not there when I
returned."</p>

<p id="id02747">"Monsieur Morrel!" exclaimed a voice on the stairs.&#8212;"Monsieur Morrel!"</p>

<p id="id02748">"It is his voice!" said Julie. At this moment Emmanuel entered, his
countenance full of animation and joy. "The Pharaon!" he cried; "the
Pharaon!"</p>

<p id="id02749">"What&#8212;what&#8212;the Pharaon! Are you mad, Emmanuel? You know the vessel is
lost."</p>

<p id="id02750">"The Pharaon, sir&#8212;they signal the Pharaon! The Pharaon is entering the
harbor!" Morrel fell back in his chair, his strength was failing him;
his understanding weakened by such events, refused to comprehend such
incredible, unheard-of, fabulous facts. But his son came in. "Father,"
cried Maximilian, "how could you say the Pharaon was lost? The lookout
has signalled her, and they say she is now coming into port."</p>

<p id="id02751">"My dear friends," said Morrel, "if this be so, it must be a miracle of
heaven! Impossible, impossible!"</p>

<p id="id02752">But what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his
hand, the acceptance receipted&#8212;the splendid diamond.</p>

<p id="id02753">"Ah, sir," exclaimed Cocles, "what can it mean?&#8212;the Pharaon?"</p>

<p id="id02754">"Come, dear ones," said Morrel, rising from his seat, "let us go and
see, and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence!" They all
went out, and on the stairs met Madame Morrel, who had been afraid to go
up into the study. In a moment they were at the Cannebiere. There was a
crowd on the pier. All the crowd gave way before Morrel. "The Pharaon,
the Pharaon!" said every voice.</p>

<p id="id02755">And, wonderful to see, in front of the tower of Saint-Jean, was a
ship bearing on her stern these words, printed in white letters, "The
Pharaon, Morrel &amp; Son, of Marseilles." She was the exact duplicate of
the other Pharaon, and loaded, as that had been, with cochineal and
indigo. She cast anchor, clued up sails, and on the deck was Captain
Gaumard giving orders, and good old Penelon making signals to M. Morrel.
To doubt any longer was impossible; there was the evidence of the
senses, and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony.
As Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and
amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with
his face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the
sentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low
tone: "Be happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done
and wilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like
your good deeds."</p>

<p id="id02756">And with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his
hiding-place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights
of steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted
"Jacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!" Then a launch came to shore, took him on
board, and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck
he sprung with the activity of a sailor; thence he once again looked
towards Morrel, who, weeping with joy, was shaking hands most cordially
with all the crowd around him, and thanking with a look the unknown
benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies. "And now," said
the unknown, "farewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude! Farewell to
all the feelings that expand the heart! I have been heaven's substitute
to recompense the good&#8212;now the god of vengeance yields to me his power
to punish the wicked!" At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only
awaiting this signal, the yacht instantly put out to sea.</p>

<h2 id="id02757" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor.</h2>

<p id="id02758">Towards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the
first society of Paris, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf and the Baron
Franz d'Epinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival at
Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years
had inhabited Italy, should act as cicerone to Albert. As it is no
inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome, especially when
you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del Popolo, or the Campo
Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the proprietor of the Hotel de
Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve comfortable apartments for them.
Signor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the
third floor, which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem.
They accepted his offer; but wishing to make the best use of the time
that was left, Albert started for Naples. As for Franz, he remained at
Florence, and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise
of the Cascine, and spending two or three evenings at the houses of
the Florentine nobility, he took a fancy into his head (having
already visited Corsica, the cradle of Bonaparte) to visit Elba, the
waiting-place of Napoleon.</p>

<p id="id02759">One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring
that secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and
lay down, and said to the crew,&#8212;"To the Island of Elba!" The boat shot
out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at
Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having followed the
traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and re-embarked
for Marciana. Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was
assured that red partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only
succeeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful
sportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper. "Ah, if your
excellency chose," said the captain, "you might have capital sport."</p>

<p id="id02760">"Where?"</p>

<p id="id02761">"Do you see that island?" continued the captain, pointing to a conical
pile rising from the indigo sea.</p>

<p id="id02762">"Well, what is this island?"</p>

<p id="id02763">"The Island of Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id02764">"But I have no permission to shoot over this island."</p>

<p id="id02765">"Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is
uninhabited."</p>

<p id="id02766">"Ah, indeed!" said the young man. "A desert island in the midst of the<br>

Mediterranean must be a curiosity."<br></p>

<p id="id02767">"It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not
contain an acre of land capable of cultivation."</p>

<p id="id02768">"To whom does this island belong?"</p>

<p id="id02769">"To Tuscany."</p>

<p id="id02770">"What game shall I find there!"</p>

<p id="id02771">"Thousands of wild goats."</p>

<p id="id02772">"Who live upon the stones, I suppose," said Franz with an incredulous
smile.</p>

<p id="id02773">"No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices
of the rocks."</p>

<p id="id02774">"Where can I sleep?"</p>

<p id="id02775">"On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your
excellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like&#8212;we can sail as
well by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our oars."</p>

<p id="id02776">As Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not
yet available, he accepted the proposition. Upon his answer in the
affirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.
"Well," asked he, "what now? Is there any difficulty in the way?"</p>

<p id="id02777">"No." replied the captain, "but we must warn your excellency that the
island is an infected port."</p>

<p id="id02778">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id02779">"Monte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a refuge
for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and
Africa, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have
to perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn."</p>

<p id="id02780">"The deuce! That puts a different face on the matter. Six days! Why,
that's as long as the Almighty took to make the world! Too long a
wait&#8212;too long."</p>

<p id="id02781">"But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id02782">"Oh, I shall not," cried Franz.</p>

<p id="id02783">"Nor I, nor I," chorused the sailors.</p>

<p id="id02784">"Then steer for Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id02785">The captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon
sailing in the direction of the island. Franz waited until all was in
order, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken
their places&#8212;three forward, and one at the helm&#8212;he resumed the
conversation. "Gaetano," said he to the captain, "you tell me Monte
Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to me, a very
different kind of game from the goats."</p>

<p id="id02786">"Yes, your excellency, and it is true."</p>

<p id="id02787">"I knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture of
Algiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in the
romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat."</p>

<p id="id02788">"Your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits who
were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet,
every day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome. Has not your excellency
heard that the French charge d'affaires was robbed six months ago within
five hundred paces of Velletri?"</p>

<p id="id02789">"Oh, yes, I heard that."</p>

<p id="id02790">"Well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you would
hear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an English
yacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita
Vecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but,
doubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered. Now this rock it has
met has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who
have surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some
desert and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses
of a forest."</p>

<p id="id02791">"But," asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the
boat, "why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French,
Sardinian, or Tuscan governments?"</p>

<p id="id02792">"Why?" said Gaetano with a smile.</p>

<p id="id02793">"Yes, why?"</p>

<p id="id02794">"Because, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their own
boat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand and
foot, they attach to every one's neck a four and twenty pound ball, a
large hole is chopped in the vessel's bottom, and then they leave her.
At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle
down. First one gun'l goes under, then the other. Then they lift and
sink again, and both go under at once. All at once there's a noise like
a cannon&#8212;that's the air blowing up the deck. Soon the water rushes
out of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the vessel gives a last
groan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming a vast whirlpool
in the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five minutes nothing but
the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the
sea. Do you understand now," said the captain, "why no complaints are
made to the government, and why the vessel never reaches port?"</p>

<p id="id02795">It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing
the expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had
started, he thought it would be cowardly to draw back. He was one of
those men who do not rashly court danger, but if danger presents itself,
combat it with the most unalterable coolness. Calm and resolute, he
treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel,&#8212;calculated
its probable method of approach; retreated, if at all, as a point of
strategy and not from cowardice; was quick to see an opening for attack,
and won victory at a single thrust. "Bah!" said he, "I have travelled
through Sicily and Calabria&#8212;I have sailed two months in the
Archipelago, and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a
pirate."</p>

<p id="id02796">"I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,"
replied Gaetano, "but you questioned me, and I have answered; that's
all."</p>

<p id="id02797">"Yes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as I wish to enjoy
it as long as possible, steer for Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id02798">The wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and
they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage. As they drew near
the island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that
they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like
cannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the
crevices. As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil
yet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully
watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a
few fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible. They were
within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind
Corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing their rugged
peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant Adamastor, rose
dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the light that gilded
its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow. Little by little
the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of
the expiring day; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the
mountain, where it paused an instant, like the fiery crest of a volcano,
then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base, and
the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually
darker; half an hour after, the night was quite dark.</p>

<p id="id02799">Fortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every
rock in the Tuscan Archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity Franz
was not without uneasiness&#8212;Corsica had long since disappeared, and
Monte Cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the
lynx, to see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the
slightest hesitation. An hour had passed since the sun had set, when
Franz fancied he saw, at a quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass,
but he could not precisely make out what it was, and fearing to excite
the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land, he
remained silent; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand; land
might resemble a cloud, but the fire was not a meteor. "What is this
light?" asked he.</p>

<p id="id02800">"Hush!" said the captain; "it is a fire."</p>

<p id="id02801">"But you told me the island was uninhabited?"</p>

<p id="id02802">"I said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that it
served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers."</p>

<p id="id02803">"And for pirates?"</p>

<p id="id02804">"And for pirates," returned Gaetano, repeating Franz's words. "It is for
that reason I have given orders to pass the island, for, as you see, the
fire is behind us."</p>

<p id="id02805">"But this fire?" continued Franz. "It seems to me rather reassuring than
otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire."</p>

<p id="id02806">"Oh, that goes for nothing," said Gaetano. "If you can guess the
position of the island in the darkness, you will see that the fire
cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa, but only from the sea."</p>

<p id="id02807">"You think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant
neighbors?"</p>

<p id="id02808">"That is what we must find out," returned Gaetano, fixing his eyes on
this terrestrial star.</p>

<p id="id02809">"How can you find out?"</p>

<p id="id02810">"You shall see." Gaetano consulted with his companions, and after five
minutes' discussion a manoeuvre was executed which caused the vessel to
tack about, they returned the way they had come, and in a few minutes
the fire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land. The pilot
again changed the course of the boat, which rapidly approached the
island, and was soon within fifty paces of it. Gaetano lowered the sail,
and the boat came to rest. All this was done in silence, and from the
moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken.</p>

<p id="id02811">Gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the
responsibility on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him,
while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row
away, which, thanks to the darkness, would not be difficult. As for
Franz, he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two
double-barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them, looked at the
priming, and waited quietly. During this time the captain had thrown off
his vest and shirt, and secured his trousers round his waist; his feet
were naked, so he had no shoes and stockings to take off; after these
preparations he placed his finger on his lips, and lowering himself
noiselessly into the sea, swam towards the shore with such precaution
that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound; he could only
be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake. This track soon
disappeared; it was evident that he had touched the shore. Every one on
board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same luminous track
was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board. "Well?" exclaimed
Franz and the sailors in unison.</p>

<p id="id02812">"They are Spanish smugglers," said he; "they have with them two Corsican
bandits."</p>

<p id="id02813">"And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers?"</p>

<p id="id02814">"Alas," returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity,
"we ought always to help one another. Very often the bandits are hard
pressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a vessel, and good
fellows like us on board, they come and demand hospitality of us; you
can't refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we receive them, and for
greater security we stand out to sea. This costs us nothing, and saves
the life, or at least the liberty, of a fellow-creature, who on the
first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where
we can land our goods without interruption."</p>

<p id="id02815">"Ah!" said Franz, "then you are a smuggler occasionally, Gaetano?"</p>

<p id="id02816">"Your excellency, we must live somehow," returned the other, smiling
impenetrably.</p>

<p id="id02817">"Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id02818">"Oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other by
signs."</p>

<p id="id02819">"And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?"</p>

<p id="id02820">"Nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves."</p>

<p id="id02821">"But these two Corsican bandits?" said Franz, calculating the chances of
peril.</p>

<p id="id02822">"It is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the
authorities."</p>

<p id="id02823">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id02824">"Because they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not in a<br>

Corsican's nature to revenge himself."<br></p>

<p id="id02825">"What do you mean by having made a stiff?&#8212;having assassinated a man?"
said Franz, continuing his investigation.</p>

<p id="id02826">"I mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different
thing," returned the captain.</p>

<p id="id02827">"Well," said the young man, "let us demand hospitality of these
smugglers and bandits. Do you think they will grant it?"</p>

<p id="id02828">"Without doubt."</p>

<p id="id02829">"How many are they?"</p>

<p id="id02830">"Four, and the two bandits make six."</p>

<p id="id02831">"Just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be able to
hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id02832">"Yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions."</p>

<p id="id02833">"By all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do more
than permit, I exhort you."</p>

<p id="id02834">"Silence, then!" said Gaetano.</p>

<p id="id02835">Every one obeyed. For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in
its true light, it was a grave one. He was alone in the darkness with
sailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to
him; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who
had often examined his weapons,&#8212;which were very beautiful,&#8212;if not with
envy, at least with curiosity. On the other hand, he was about to land,
without any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed,
a very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford
him much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits. The history
of the scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable during the day,
seemed very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible
sources of danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his gun in his
hand. The sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more
cleaving the waves. Through the darkness Franz, whose eyes were now more
accustomed to it, could see the looming shore along which the boat was
sailing, and then, as they rounded a rocky point, he saw the fire more
brilliant than ever, and about it five or six persons seated. The blaze
illumined the sea for a hundred paces around. Gaetano skirted the light,
carefully keeping the boat in the shadow; then, when they were opposite
the fire, he steered to the centre of the circle, singing a fishing
song, of which his companions sung the chorus. At the first words of
the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the
landing-place, their eyes fixed on the boat, evidently seeking to
know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions. They soon
appeared satisfied and returned (with the exception of one, who
remained at the shore) to their fire, at which the carcass of a goat was
roasting. When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore, the man on
the beach, who carried a carbine, presented arms after the manner of
a sentinel, and cried, "Who comes there?" in Sardinian. Franz coolly
cocked both barrels. Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man
which the traveller did not understand, but which evidently concerned
him. "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?" asked
the captain.</p>

<p id="id02836">"My name must rest unknown,&#8212;merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for
pleasure." As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer, the sentinel
gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire, who rose and
disappeared among the rocks. Not a word was spoken, every one seemed
occupied, Franz with his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails,
the smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness
it was evident that they mutually observed each other. The man who had
disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he
had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel, who, turning
to the boat, said, "S'accommodi." The Italian s'accommodi is
untranslatable; it means at once, "Come, enter, you are welcome; make
yourself at home; you are the master." It is like that Turkish phrase
of Moliere's that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of
things implied in its utterance. The sailors did not wait for a second
invitation; four strokes of the oar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang
to shore, exchanged a few words with the sentinel, then his comrades
disembarked, and lastly came Franz. One of his guns was swung over his
shoulder, Gaetano had the other, and a sailor held his rifle; his
dress, half artist, half dandy, did not excite any suspicion, and,
consequently, no disquietude. The boat was moored to the shore, and they
advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac; but, doubtless,
the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of
sentinel, for he cried out, "Not that way, if you please."</p>

<p id="id02837">Gaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while
two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.
They advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade
surrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike
sentry-boxes. Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks
and thick bushes of myrtles. Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass
of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover
this retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the
wandering visitors of Monte Cristo. As for his suspicions, once on
terra firma, once that he had seen the indifferent, if not friendly,
appearance of his hosts, his anxiety had quite disappeared, or rather,
at sight of the goat, had turned to appetite. He mentioned this to
Gaetano, who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare
a supper when they had in their boat, bread, wine, half a dozen
partridges, and a good fire to roast them by. "Besides," added he, "if
the smell of their roast meat tempts you, I will go and offer them two
of our birds for a slice."</p>

<p id="id02838">"You are a born diplomat," returned Franz; "go and try."</p>

<p id="id02839">Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which
they made a fire. Franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of the
roasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.</p>

<p id="id02840">"Well," said Franz, "anything new?&#8212;do they refuse?"</p>

<p id="id02841">"On the contrary," returned Gaetano, "the chief, who was told you were a
young Frenchman, invites you to sup with him."</p>

<p id="id02842">"Well," observed Franz, "this chief is very polite, and I see no
objection&#8212;the more so as I bring my share of the supper."</p>

<p id="id02843">"Oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he
makes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive
you at his house."</p>

<p id="id02844">"His house? Has he built one here, then?"</p>

<p id="id02845">"No; but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say."</p>

<p id="id02846">"You know this chief, then?"</p>

<p id="id02847">"I have heard talk of him."</p>

<p id="id02848">"Favorably or otherwise?"</p>

<p id="id02849">"Both."</p>

<p id="id02850">"The deuce!&#8212;and what is this condition?"</p>

<p id="id02851">"That you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he
himself bids you." Franz looked at Gaetano, to see, if possible, what he
thought of this proposal. "Ah," replied he, guessing Franz's thought, "I
know this is a serious matter."</p>

<p id="id02852">"What should you do in my place?"</p>

<p id="id02853">"I, who have nothing to lose,&#8212;I should go."</p>

<p id="id02854">"You would accept?"</p>

<p id="id02855">"Yes, were it only out of curiosity."</p>

<p id="id02856">"There is something very peculiar about this chief, then?"</p>

<p id="id02857">"Listen," said Gaetano, lowering his voice, "I do not know if what they
say is true"&#8212;he stopped to see if any one was near.</p>

<p id="id02858">"What do they say?"</p>

<p id="id02859">"That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is
nothing."</p>

<p id="id02860">"What nonsense!" said Franz, reseating himself.</p>
