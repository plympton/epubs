<p id="id10473">"Now, madame," continued Debray, first opening the closet, then
the chest;&#8212;"now, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000. francs each,
resembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this I add a
certificate in the funds of 25,000. francs; then, for the odd cash,
making I think about 110,000. francs, here is a check upon my banker,
who, not being M. Danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest
assured." Madame Danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the
heap of bank-notes. This enormous fortune made no great appearance on
the table. Madame Danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast
heaving with concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put
the certificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale
and mute, awaited one kind word of consolation. But she waited in vain.</p>

<p id="id10474">"Now, madame," said Debray, "you have a splendid fortune, an income of
about 60,000 livres a year, which is enormous for a woman who cannot
keep an establishment here for a year, at least. You will be able
to indulge all your fancies; besides, should you find your income
insufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of
mine; and I am ready to offer you all I possess, on loan."</p>

<p id="id10475">"Thank you, sir&#8212;thank you," replied the baroness; "you forget that
what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires, who
intends for some time, at least, to retire from the world."</p>

<p id="id10476">Debray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering himself,
he bowed with an air which seemed to say, "As you please, madame."</p>

<p id="id10477">Madame Danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when
she saw the careless bow of Debray, and the glance by which it was
accompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her head,
and without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran down-stairs,
disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from
her. "Bah," said Debray, when she had left, "these are fine projects!
She will remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards, since she
can no longer do so on the Bourse." Then taking up his account book, he
cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had
just paid away. "I have 1,060,000 francs remaining," he said. "What a
pity Mademoiselle de Villefort is dead! She suited me in every respect,
and I would have married her." And he calmly waited until the twenty
minutes had elapsed after Madame Danglars' departure before he left the
house. During this time he occupied himself in making figures, with his
watch by his side.</p>

<p id="id10478">Asmodeus&#8212;that diabolical personage, who would have been created by
every fertile imagination if Le Sage had not acquired the priority in
his great masterpiece&#8212;would have enjoyed a singular spectacle, if
he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the Rue
Saint-Germain-des-Pres, while Debray was casting up his figures. Above
the room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a half with
Madame Danglars was another, inhabited by persons who have played too
prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance
not to create some interest. Mercedes and Albert were in that room.
Mercedes was much changed within the last few days; not that even in her
days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which
makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a
plain and simple attire; nor indeed, had she fallen into that state of
depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no,
the change in Mercedes was that her eye no longer sparkled, her lips
no longer smiled, and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words
which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit.</p>

<p id="id10479">It was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want
of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome. Mercedes, although
deposed from the exalted position she had occupied, lost in the sphere
she had now chosen, like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted
into utter darkness, appeared like a queen, fallen from her palace to
a hovel, and who, reduced to strict necessity, could neither become
reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place
upon the table, nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed. The
beautiful Catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and
charming smile, because she saw nothing but misery around her; the walls
were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose
as not likely to show the dirt; the floor was uncarpeted; the furniture
attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury; indeed,
everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance.</p>

<p id="id10480">Madame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the continual
silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert continually
watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings, she
constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone,
which, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually
shone from her eyes, seemed like "moonlight on a statue,"&#8212;yielding
light without warmth. Albert, too, was ill at ease; the remains of
luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position. If he wished
to go out without gloves, his hands appeared too white; if he wished to
walk through the town, his boots seemed too highly polished. Yet these
two noble and intelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble ties
of maternal and filial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one
another, and economizing their stores, and Albert had been able to tell
his mother without extorting a change of countenance,&#8212;"Mother, we have
no more money."</p>

<p id="id10481">Mercedes had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of
poverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there
is a wide difference. Amongst the Catalans, Mercedes wished for a
thousand things, but still she never really wanted any. So long as the
nets were good, they caught fish; and so long as they sold their fish,
they were able to buy twine for new nets. And then, shut out from
friendship, having but one affection, which could not be mixed up with
her ordinary pursuits, she thought of herself&#8212;of no one but herself.
Upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could; now there
were two to be supported, and nothing to live upon.</p>

<p id="id10482">Winter approached. Mercedes had no fire in that cold and naked
room&#8212;she, who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from
the hall to the boudoir; she had not even one little flower&#8212;she whose
apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics. But she had her
son. Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them.
Excitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the
things of earth. But the excitement had calmed down, and they felt
themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having
exhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual.</p>

<p id="id10483">"Mother," exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was descending the
stairs, "let us reckon our riches, if you please; I want capital to
build my plans upon."</p>

<p id="id10484">"Capital&#8212;nothing!" replied Mercedes with a mournful smile.</p>

<p id="id10485">"No, mother,&#8212;capital 3,000 francs. And I have an idea of our leading a
delightful life upon this 3,000 francs."</p>

<p id="id10486">"Child!" sighed Mercedes.</p>

<p id="id10487">"Alas, dear mother," said the young man, "I have unhappily spent too
much of your money not to know the value of it. These 3,000 francs
are enormous, and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous
certainty for the future."</p>

<p id="id10488">"You say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these
3,000 francs?" said Mercedes, coloring.</p>

<p id="id10489">"I think so," answered Albert in a firm tone. "We will accept them the
more readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in
the garden of the little house in the Allees de Meillan, at Marseilles.
With 200 francs we can reach Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id10490">"With 200 francs?&#8212;are you sure, Albert?"</p>

<p id="id10491">"Oh, as for that, I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and
steamboats, and my calculations are made. You will take your place
in the coupe to Chalons. You see, mother, I treat you handsomely for
thirty-five francs." Albert then took a pen, and wrote:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10492">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Frs.<br/>

&#160;&#160;Coupe, thirty-five francs&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; 35.<br/>

&#160;&#160;From Chalons to Lyons you will go on by the steamboat..  6.<br/>

&#160;&#160;From Lyons to Avignon (still by steamboat)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. 16.<br/>

&#160;&#160;From Avignon to Marseilles, seven francs&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  7.<br/>

&#160;&#160;Expenses on the road, about fifty francs&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; 50.<br/>

&#160;&#160;Total&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. 114 frs.<br/></p>

<p id="id10493">"Let us put down 120," added Albert, smiling. "You see I am generous, am<br/>

I not, mother?"<br/></p>

<p id="id10494">"But you, my poor child?"</p>

<p id="id10495">"I? do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself? A young man
does not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is."</p>

<p id="id10496">"With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?"</p>

<p id="id10497">"Any way, mother."</p>

<p id="id10498">"Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?"</p>

<p id="id10499">"Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for
100 francs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the
ornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of
superfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs
we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250."</p>

<p id="id10500">"But we owe something in this house?"</p>

<p id="id10501">"Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,&#8212;that is
understood,&#8212;and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see
I am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to
this, mother?"</p>

<p id="id10502">And Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a
remnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of
the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little
door,&#8212;Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.</p>

<p id="id10503">"What is this?" asked Mercedes.</p>

<p id="id10504">"A thousand francs."</p>

<p id="id10505">"But whence have you obtained them?"</p>

<p id="id10506">"Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation." And
Albert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at
her. "You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!" said the
young man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love. "You are,
indeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!"</p>

<p id="id10507">"Dear child!" said Mercedes, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear
which glistened in the corner of her eye. "Indeed, you only wanted
misfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not unhappy
while I possess my son!"</p>

<p id="id10508">"Ah, just so," said Albert; "here begins the trial. Do you know the
decision we have come to, mother?"</p>

<p id="id10509">"Have we come to any?"</p>

<p id="id10510">"Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I am to
leave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the name
I now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside." Mercedes sighed.
"Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the Spahis,"
[*] added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of
shame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self-
abasement. "I thought my body was my own, and that I might sell it. I
yesterday took the place of another. I sold myself for more than I
thought I was worth," he added, attempting to smile; "I fetched 2,000
francs."</p>

<p id="id10511">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;* The Spahis are French cavalry reserved for service in<br/>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Africa.<br/></p>

<p id="id10512">"Then these 1,000 francs"&#8212;said Mercedes, shuddering&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10513">"Are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year."</p>

<p id="id10514">Mercedes raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be
impossible to describe, and tears, which had hitherto been restrained,
now yielded to her emotion, and ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p id="id10515">"The price of his blood!" she murmured.</p>

<p id="id10516">"Yes, if I am killed," said Albert, laughing. "But I assure you, mother,
I have a strong intention of defending my person, and I never felt half
so strong an inclination to live as I do now."</p>

<p id="id10517">"Merciful heavens!"</p>

<p id="id10518">"Besides, mother, why should you make up your mind that I am to be
killed? Has Lamoriciere, that Ney of the South, been killed? Has
Changarnier been killed? Has Bedeau been killed? Has Morrel, whom we
know, been killed? Think of your joy, mother, when you see me return
with an embroidered uniform! I declare, I expect to look magnificent
in it, and chose that regiment only from vanity." Mercedes sighed while
endeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt that she ought not to
allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son. "Well,
now you understand, mother!" continued Albert; "here are more than 4,000
francs settled on you; upon these you can live at least two years."</p>

<p id="id10519">"Do you think so?" said Mercedes. These words were uttered in so
mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape Albert; he felt
his heart beat, and taking his mother's hand within his own he said,
tenderly,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10520">"Yes, you will live!"</p>

<p id="id10521">"I shall live!&#8212;then you will not leave me, Albert?"</p>

<p id="id10522">"Mother, I must go," said Albert in a firm, calm voice; "you love me
too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you; besides, I have
signed."</p>

<p id="id10523">"You will obey your own wish and the will of heaven!"</p>

<p id="id10524">"Not my own wish, mother, but reason&#8212;necessity. Are we not two
despairing creatures? What is life to you?&#8212;Nothing. What is life to
me?&#8212;Very little without you, mother; for believe me, but for you I
should have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and renounced
his name. Well, I will live, if you promise me still to hope; and if
you grant me the care of your future prospects, you will redouble my
strength. Then I will go to the governor of Algeria; he has a royal
heart, and is essentially a soldier; I will tell him my gloomy story.
I will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me, and if he
keep his word and interest himself for me, in six months I shall be an
officer, or dead. If I am an officer, your fortune is certain, for I
shall have money enough for both, and, moreover, a name we shall both
be proud of, since it will be our own. If I am killed&#8212;well then mother,
you can also die, and there will be an end of our misfortunes."</p>

<p id="id10525">"It is well," replied Mercedes, with her eloquent glance; "you are
right, my love; let us prove to those who are watching our actions that
we are worthy of compassion."</p>

<p id="id10526">"But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions," said the young man; "I
assure you we are, or rather we shall be, very happy. You are a woman at
once full of spirit and resignation; I have become simple in my tastes,
and am without passion, I hope. Once in service, I shall be rich&#8212;once
in M. Dantes' house, you will be at rest. Let us strive, I beseech
you,&#8212;let us strive to be cheerful."</p>

<p id="id10527">"Yes, let us strive, for you ought to live, and to be happy, Albert."</p>

<p id="id10528">"And so our division is made, mother," said the young man, affecting
ease of mind. "We can now part; come, I shall engage your passage."</p>

<p id="id10529">"And you, my dear boy?"</p>

<p id="id10530">"I shall stay here for a few days longer; we must accustom ourselves to
parting. I want recommendations and some information relative to Africa.
I will join you again at Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id10531">"Well, be it so&#8212;let us part," said Mercedes, folding around her
shoulders the only shawl she had taken away, and which accidentally
happened to be a valuable black cashmere. Albert gathered up his papers
hastily, rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord,
and offering his arm to his mother, they descended the stairs. Some one
was walking down before them, and this person, hearing the rustling of a
silk dress, turned around. "Debray!" muttered Albert.</p>

<p id="id10532">"You, Morcerf?" replied the secretary, resting on the stairs. Curiosity
had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito, and he was
recognized. It was, indeed, strange in this unknown spot to find the
young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in Paris.</p>

<p id="id10533">"Morcerf!" repeated Debray. Then noticing in the dim light the still
youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf:&#8212;"Pardon me," he added
with a smile, "I leave you, Albert." Albert understood his thoughts.
"Mother," he said, turning towards Mercedes, "this is M. Debray,
secretary of the minister for the interior, once a friend of mine."</p>

<p id="id10534">"How once?" stammered Debray; "what do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id10535">"I say so, M. Debray, because I have no friends now, and I ought not
to have any. I thank you for having recognized me, sir." Debray stepped
forward, and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor. "Believe
me, dear Albert," he said, with all the emotion he was capable of
feeling,&#8212;"believe me, I feel deeply for your misfortunes, and if in any
way I can serve you, I am yours."</p>

<p id="id10536">"Thank you, sir," said Albert, smiling. "In the midst of our
misfortunes, we are still rich enough not to require assistance from any
one. We are leaving Paris, and when our journey is paid, we shall have
5,000 francs left." The blood mounted to the temples of Debray, who held
a million in his pocket-book, and unimaginative as he was he could not
help reflecting that the same house had contained two women, one of
whom, justly dishonored, had left it poor with 1,500,000. francs under
her cloak, while the other, unjustly stricken, but sublime in her
misfortune, was yet rich with a few deniers. This parallel disturbed his
usual politeness, the philosophy he witnessed appalled him, he muttered
a few words of general civility and ran down-stairs.</p>

<p id="id10537">That day the minister's clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to
put up with from his ill-humor. But that same night, he found himself
the possessor of a fine house, situated on the Boulevard de la
Madeleine, and an income of 50,000 livres. The next day, just as Debray
was signing the deed, that is about five o'clock in the afternoon,
Madame de Morcerf, after having affectionately embraced her son, entered
the coupe of the diligence, which closed upon her. A man was hidden in
Lafitte's banking-house, behind one of the little arched windows which
are placed above each desk; he saw Mercedes enter the diligence, and he
also saw Albert withdraw. Then he passed his hand across his forehead,
which was clouded with doubt. "Alas," he exclaimed, "how can I restore
the happiness I have taken away from these poor innocent creatures? God
help me!"</p>

<h2 id="id10538" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 107. The Lions' Den.</h2>

<p id="id10539">One division of La Force, in which the most dangerous and desperate
prisoners are confined, is called the court of Saint-Bernard. The
prisoners, in their expressive language, have named it the "Lions' Den,"
probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the
bars, and sometimes the keepers also. It is a prison within a prison;
the walls are double the thickness of the rest. The gratings are every
day carefully examined by jailers, whose herculean proportions and cold
pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their
subjects for their superior activity and intelligence. The court-yard of
this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls, over which the sun glances
obliquely, when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and
physical deformity. On this paved yard are to be seen,&#8212;pacing to and
fro from morning till night, pale, careworn, and haggard, like so
many shadows,&#8212;the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is
sharpening. There, crouched against the side of the wall which attracts
and retains the most heat, they may be seen sometimes talking to one
another, but more frequently alone, watching the door, which sometimes
opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage, or to throw in
another outcast from society.</p>

<p id="id10540">The court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the
reception of guests; it is a long rectangle, divided by two upright
gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent
a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners.
It is a wretched, damp, nay, even horrible spot, more especially when we
consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those
iron bars. And yet, frightful though this spot may be, it is looked upon
as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered; it is so rare
for them to leave the Lions' Den for any other place than the barrier
Saint-Jacques or the galleys!</p>

<p id="id10541">In the court which we have attempted to describe, and from which a damp
vapor was rising, a young man with his hands in his pockets, who had
excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the "Den," might be seen
walking. The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant
man, if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they did not
show signs of wear, and the fine cloth, beneath the careful hands of
the prisoner, soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still
perfect, for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance
of a new coat. He bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of
a shirt, which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into
the prison, and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a
handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet. Some
of the inmates of the "Lions' Den" were watching the operations of
the prisoner's toilet with considerable interest. "See, the prince is
pluming himself," said one of the thieves. "He's a fine looking fellow,"
said another; "if he had only a comb and hair-grease, he'd take the
shine off the gentlemen in white kids."</p>

<p id="id10542">"His coat looks almost new, and his boots shine like a nigger's face.
It's pleasant to have such well-dressed comrades; but didn't those
gendarmes behave shameful?&#8212;must 'a been jealous, to tear such clothes!"</p>

<p id="id10543">"He looks like a big-bug," said another; "dresses in fine style. And,
then, to be here so young! Oh, what larks!" Meanwhile the object of
this hideous admiration approached the wicket, against which one of the
keepers was leaning. "Come, sir," he said, "lend me twenty francs; you
will soon be paid; you run no risks with me. Remember, I have relations
who possess more millions than you have deniers. Come, I beseech
you, lend me twenty francs, so that I may buy a dressing-gown; it is
intolerable always to be in a coat and boots! And what a coat, sir, for
a prince of the Cavalcanti!" The keeper turned his back, and shrugged
his shoulders; he did not even laugh at what would have caused any one
else to do so; he had heard so many utter the same things,&#8212;indeed, he
heard nothing else.</p>

<p id="id10544">"Come," said Andrea, "you are a man void of compassion; I'll have you
turned out." This made the keeper turn around, and he burst into a loud
laugh. The prisoners then approached and formed a circle. "I tell you
that with that wretched sum," continued Andrea, "I could obtain a
coat, and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I am daily
expecting."</p>

<p id="id10545">"Of course&#8212;of course," said the prisoners;&#8212;"any one can see he's a
gentleman!"</p>

<p id="id10546">"Well, then, lend him the twenty francs," said the keeper, leaning on
the other shoulder; "surely you will not refuse a comrade!"</p>

<p id="id10547">"I am no comrade of these people," said the young man, proudly, "you
have no right to insult me thus."</p>

<p id="id10548">The thieves looked at one another with low murmurs, and a storm gathered
over the head of the aristocratic prisoner, raised less by his own
words than by the manner of the keeper. The latter, sure of quelling
the tempest when the waves became too violent, allowed them to rise to
a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate Andrea,
and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day. The
thieves had already approached Andrea, some screaming, "La savate&#8212;La
savate!" [*] a cruel operation, which consists in cuffing a comrade who
may have fallen into disgrace, not with an old shoe, but with an
iron-heeled one. Others proposed the "anguille," another kind of
recreation, in which a handkerchief is filled with sand, pebbles, and
two-sous pieces, when they have them, which the wretches beat like a
flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer. "Let us
horsewhip the fine gentleman!" said others.</p>

<p id="id10549">     * Savate: an old shoe.</p>

<p id="id10550">But Andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue
around his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a
hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent. It was a
Masonic sign Caderousse had taught him. He was immediately recognized as
one of them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled shoe
replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged. Some voices were
heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he intended to be
civil, in his way, and that they would set the example of liberty of
conscience,&#8212;and the mob retired. The keeper was so stupefied at this
scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began examining his person,
attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the Lions' Den
to something more substantial than mere fascination. Andrea made no
resistance, although he protested against it. Suddenly a voice was heard
at the wicket. "Benedetto!" exclaimed an inspector. The keeper relaxed
his hold. "I am called," said Andrea. "To the visitors' room!" said the
same voice.</p>

<p id="id10551">"You see some one pays me a visit. Ah, my dear sir, you will see whether
a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!" And Andrea, gliding
through the court like a black shadow, rushed out through the wicket,
leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in wonder. Certainly
a call to the visitors' room had scarcely astonished Andrea less than
themselves, for the wily youth, instead of making use of his privilege
of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force, had maintained
a rigid silence. "Everything," he said, "proves me to be under the
protection of some powerful person,&#8212;this sudden fortune, the facility
with which I have overcome all obstacles, an unexpected family and an
illustrious name awarded to me, gold showered down upon me, and the most
splendid alliances about to be entered into. An unhappy lapse of fortune
and the absence of my protector have cast me down, certainly, but
not forever. The hand which has retreated for a while will be again
stretched forth to save me at the very moment when I shall think myself
sinking into the abyss. Why should I risk an imprudent step? It might
alienate my protector. He has two means of extricating me from this
dilemma,&#8212;the one by a mysterious escape, managed through bribery; the
other by buying off my judges with gold. I will say and do nothing until
I am convinced that he has quite abandoned me, and then"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10552">Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever. The unfortunate
youth was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne
with the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by
degrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from
being naked, dirty, and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort that
the inspector's voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt his
heart leap with joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining
magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or the
doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the grating
of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes
dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M. Bertuccio,
who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars, the bolted
doors, and the shadow which moved behind the other grating.</p>

<p id="id10553">"Ah," said Andrea, deeply affected.</p>

<p id="id10554">"Good morning, Benedetto," said Bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice.</p>

<p id="id10555">"You&#8212;you?" said the young man, looking fearfully around him.</p>

<p id="id10556">"Do you not recognize me, unhappy child?"</p>

<p id="id10557">"Silence,&#8212;be silent!" said Andrea, who knew the delicate sense of
hearing possessed by the walls; "for heaven's sake, do not speak so
loud!"</p>

<p id="id10558">"You wish to speak with me alone, do you not?" said Bertuccio.</p>

<p id="id10559">"Oh, yes."</p>

<p id="id10560">"That is well." And Bertuccio, feeling in his pocket, signed to a keeper
whom he saw through the window of the wicket.</p>

<p id="id10561">"Read?" he said.</p>

<p id="id10562">"What is that?" asked Andrea.</p>

<p id="id10563">"An order to conduct you to a room, and to leave you there to talk to
me."</p>

<p id="id10564">"Oh," cried Andrea, leaping with joy. Then he mentally added,&#8212;"Still my
unknown protector! I am not forgotten. They wish for secrecy, since we
are to converse in a private room. I understand, Bertuccio has been sent
by my protector."</p>

<p id="id10565">The keeper spoke for a moment with an official, then opened the iron
gates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first floor. The room was
whitewashed, as is the custom in prisons, but it looked quite brilliant
to a prisoner, though a stove, a bed, a chair, and a table formed the
whole of its sumptuous furniture. Bertuccio sat down upon the chair,
Andrea threw himself upon the bed; the keeper retired.</p>

<p id="id10566">"Now," said the steward, "what have you to tell me?"</p>

<p id="id10567">"And you?" said Andrea.</p>

<p id="id10568">"You speak first."</p>

<p id="id10569">"Oh, no. You must have much to tell me, since you have come to seek me."</p>

<p id="id10570">"Well, be it so. You have continued your course of villany; you have
robbed&#8212;you have assassinated."</p>

<p id="id10571">"Well, I should say! If you had me taken to a private room only to tell
me this, you might have saved yourself the trouble. I know all these
things. But there are some with which, on the contrary, I am not
acquainted. Let us talk of those, if you please. Who sent you?"</p>

<p id="id10572">"Come, come, you are going on quickly, M. Benedetto!"</p>

<p id="id10573">"Yes, and to the point. Let us dispense with useless words. Who sends
you?"</p>

<p id="id10574">"No one."</p>

<p id="id10575">"How did you know I was in prison?"</p>

<p id="id10576">"I recognized you, some time since, as the insolent dandy who so
gracefully mounted his horse in the Champs Elysees."</p>

<p id="id10577">"Oh, the Champs Elysees? Ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game
of pincette. The Champs Elysees? Come, let us talk a little about my
father."</p>

<p id="id10578">"Who, then, am I?"</p>

<p id="id10579">"You, sir?&#8212;you are my adopted father. But it was not you, I presume,
who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which I spent in four or five
months; it was not you who manufactured an Italian gentleman for my
father; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me
invited to a certain dinner at Auteuil, which I fancy I am eating
at this moment, in company with the most distinguished people in
Paris&#8212;amongst the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance I
did very wrong not to cultivate, for he would have been very useful
to me just now;&#8212;it was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two
millions, when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place. Come,
speak, my worthy Corsican, speak!"</p>

<p id="id10580">"What do you wish me to say?"</p>

<p id="id10581">"I will help you. You were speaking of the Champs Elysees just now,
worthy foster-father."</p>

<p id="id10582">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id10583">"Well, in the Champs Elysees there resides a very rich gentleman."</p>

<p id="id10584">"At whose house you robbed and murdered, did you not?"</p>

<p id="id10585">"I believe I did."</p>

<p id="id10586">"The Count of Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id10587">"'Tis you who have named him, as M. Racine says. Well, am I to rush into
his arms, and strain him to my heart, crying, 'My father, my father!'
like Monsieur Pixerecourt." [*]</p>

<p id="id10588">"Do not let us jest," gravely replied Bertuccio, "and dare not to utter
that name again as you have pronounced it."</p>

<p id="id10589">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;* Guilbert de Pixerecourt, French dramatist<br/>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(1775-1844).<br/></p>

<p id="id10590">"Bah," said Andrea, a little overcome, by the solemnity of Bertuccio's
manner, "why not?"</p>

<p id="id10591">"Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be
the father of such a wretch as you."</p>

<p id="id10592">"Oh, these are fine words."</p>

<p id="id10593">"And there will be fine doings, if you do not take care."</p>

<p id="id10594">"Menaces&#8212;I do not fear them. I will say"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10595">"Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?" said
Bertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that
Andrea was moved to the very soul. "Do you think you have to do with
galley-slaves, or novices in the world? Benedetto, you are fallen into
terrible hands; they are ready to open for you&#8212;make use of them. Do not
play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment, but which
they can take up again instantly, if you attempt to intercept their
movements."</p>

<p id="id10596">"My father&#8212;I will know who my father is," said the obstinate youth; "I
will perish if I must, but I will know it. What does scandal signify
to me? What possessions, what reputation, what 'pull,' as Beauchamp
says,&#8212;have I? You great people always lose something by scandal,
notwithstanding your millions. Come, who is my father?"</p>

<p id="id10597">"I came to tell you."</p>

<p id="id10598">"Ah," cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy. Just then the door
opened, and the jailer, addressing himself to Bertuccio, said,&#8212;"Excuse
me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner."</p>

<p id="id10599">"And so closes our interview," said Andrea to the worthy steward; "I
wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!"</p>

<p id="id10600">"I will return to-morrow," said Bertuccio.</p>

<p id="id10601">"Good! Gendarmes, I am at your service. Ah, sir, do leave a few crowns
for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of!"</p>

<p id="id10602">"It shall be done," replied Bertuccio. Andrea extended his hand;
Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket, and merely jingled a few pieces
of money. "That's what I mean," said Andrea, endeavoring to smile, quite
overcome by the strange tranquillity of Bertuccio. "Can I be deceived?"
he murmured, as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they
call "the salad basket." "Never mind, we shall see! To-morrow, then!" he
added, turning towards Bertuccio.</p>

<p id="id10603">"To-morrow!" replied the steward.</p>

<h2 id="id10604" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 108. The Judge.</h2>

<p id="id10605">We remember that the Abbe Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the
chamber of death, and that the old man and the priest were the sole
guardians of the young girl's body. Perhaps it was the Christian
exhortations of the abbe, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his
persuasive words, which had restored the courage of Noirtier, for ever
since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded
to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive
affection for Valentine. M. de Villefort had not seen his father since
the morning of the death. The whole establishment had been changed;
another valet was engaged for himself, a new servant for Noirtier, two
women had entered Madame de Villefort's service,&#8212;in fact, everywhere,
to the concierge and coachmen, new faces were presented to the different
masters of the house, thus widening the division which had always
existed between the members of the same family.</p>

<p id="id10606">The assizes, also, were about to begin, and Villefort, shut up in his
room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case
against the murderer of Caderousse. This affair, like all those in which
the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in
Paris. The proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon
a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death-bed, and who
might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.
But the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that
Benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this
aggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only
vulnerable point left in his frozen heart.</p>

<p id="id10607">The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of
Villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming
assizes. He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to evade
the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose
of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial. And
then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine,
and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent, that no one
wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties, which
were the only means he had of dissipating his grief.</p>

<p id="id10608">Once only had Villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon
which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto, when the latter
was to learn his father's name. The magistrate, harassed and fatigued,
had descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar
to that in which Tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began
knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the
rose-trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of
the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season. More than
once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded
gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning by the
same path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with the same
gesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house, whence
he heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from school to
spend the Sunday and Monday with his mother. While doing so, he observed
M. Noirtier at one of the open windows, where the old man had been
placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded
some heat, and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of
the creeper which twined around the balcony.</p>

<p id="id10609">The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could
scarcely distinguish. His glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and
savage impatience, that Villefort turned out of the path he had been
pursuing, to see upon what person this dark look was directed. Then he
saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly divested
of foliage, Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her hand, the
perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son, or
to throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from the
drawing-room into the garden. Villefort became pale; he understood the
old man's meaning. Noirtier continued to look at the same object, but
suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband, and
Villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes,
which, while changing their direction and even their language, had lost
none of their menacing expression. Madame de Villefort, unconscious of
the passions that exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment
held her son's ball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a
kiss. Edward begged for a long while, the maternal kiss probably not
offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain
it; however at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a
cluster of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead
streaming with perspiration. Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead,
pressed her lips upon it, and sent him back with the ball in one hand
and some bonbons in the other.</p>

<p id="id10610">Villefort, drawn by an irresistible attraction, like that of the bird to
the serpent, walked towards the house. As he approached it, Noirtier's
gaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that
Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart. In that earnest
look might be read a deep reproach, as well as a terrible menace. Then
Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to remind his son of a
forgotten oath. "It is well, sir," replied Villefort from below,&#8212;"it
is well; have patience but one day longer; what I have said I will do."
Noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with
indifference to the other side. Villefort violently unbuttoned his
great-coat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand
across his forehead, entered his study.</p>

<p id="id10611">The night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but
Villefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o'clock in the
morning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the
examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses, and
putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was one of
the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered.</p>

<p id="id10612">The next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning
dawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon
the lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a short
time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its flickerings
awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they
had been dipped in blood. He opened the window; a bright yellow streak
crossed the sky, and seemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood
out in black relief on the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the
chestnut-trees, a lark was mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her
clear morning song. The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort,
and refreshed his memory. "To-day," he said with an effort,&#8212;"to-day the
man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt."
Involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier's room,
where he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and
yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed
the closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the
opening he had beheld the menacing old man. "Yes," he murmured,&#8212;"yes,
be satisfied."</p>

<p id="id10613">His head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his
study; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to
sleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees
every one awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises
which accompany the life of a house,&#8212;the opening and shutting of doors,
the ringing of Madame de Villefort's bell, to summon the waiting-maid,
mingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the
enjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him the
papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.</p>

<p id="id10614">"What are you bringing me?" said he.</p>

<p id="id10615">"A cup of chocolate."</p>

<p id="id10616">"I did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?"</p>

<p id="id10617">"My mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in
the murder case, and that you should take something to keep up your
strength;" and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the
sofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers. The valet then
left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression,
then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion, he swallowed its
contents at one draught. It might have been thought that he hoped the
beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for death to deliver him
from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil. He then rose, and
paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness.
The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort felt no effects. The
breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The valet
re-entered.</p>

<p id="id10618">"Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir," he said, "that eleven
o'clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve."</p>

<p id="id10619">"Well," said Villefort, "what then?"</p>

<p id="id10620">"Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know
if she is to accompany you, sir?"</p>

<p id="id10621">"Where to?"</p>

<p id="id10622">"To the Palais."</p>

<p id="id10623">"What to do?"</p>

<p id="id10624">"My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial."</p>

<p id="id10625">"Ah," said Villefort, with a startling accent; "does she wish
that?"&#8212;The man drew back and said, "If you wish to go alone, sir, I
will go and tell my mistress." Villefort remained silent for a moment,
and dented his pale cheeks with his nails. "Tell your mistress," he at
length answered, "that I wish to speak to her, and I beg she will wait
for me in her own room."</p>

<p id="id10626">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p id="id10627">"Then come to dress and shave me."</p>

<p id="id10628">"Directly, sir." The valet re-appeared almost instantly, and, having
shaved his master, assisted him to dress entirely in black. When he had
finished, he said,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10629">"My mistress said she should expect you, sir, as soon as you had
finished dressing."</p>

<p id="id10630">"I am going to her." And Villefort, with his papers under his arm and
hat in hand, directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife. At the
door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp, pale brow. He then entered
the room. Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently
turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young
Edward, by way of amusing himself, was tearing to pieces before his
mother could finish reading them. She was dressed to go out, her bonnet
was placed beside her on a chair, and her gloves were on her hands.</p>

<p id="id10631">"Ah, here you are, monsieur," she said in her naturally calm voice; "but
how pale you are! Have you been working all night? Why did you not come
down to breakfast? Well, will you take me, or shall I take Edward?"
Madame de Villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one
answer, but to all her inquiries M. de Villefort remained mute and cold
as a statue. "Edward," said Villefort, fixing an imperious glance on
the child, "go and play in the drawing-room, my dear; I wish to speak
to your mamma." Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold
countenance, that resolute tone, and the awfully strange preliminaries.
Edward raised his head, looked at his mother, and then, finding that
she did not confirm the order, began cutting off the heads of his leaden
soldiers.</p>

<p id="id10632">"Edward," cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up
from the floor, "do you hear me?&#8212;Go!" The child, unaccustomed to such
treatment, arose, pale and trembling; it would be difficult to say
whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion. His father went up
to him, took him in his arms, and kissed his forehead. "Go," he said:
"go, my child." Edward ran out. M. de Villefort went to the door, which
he closed behind the child, and bolted. "Dear me!" said the young woman,
endeavoring to read her husband's inmost thoughts, while a smile passed
over her countenance which froze the impassibility of Villefort; "what
is the matter?"</p>

<p id="id10633">"Madame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?" said the
magistrate, without any introduction, placing himself between his wife
and the door.</p>

<p id="id10634">Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of
a bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its head.
A hoarse, broken tone, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from
her, while she became deadly pale. "Monsieur," she said, "I&#8212;I do not
understand you." And, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised
herself from the sofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other,
she fell down again on the cushions. "I asked you," continued Villefort,
in a perfectly calm tone, "where you conceal the poison by the aid
of which you have killed my father-in-law, M. de Saint-Meran, my
mother-in-law, Madame de Saint-Meran, Barrois, and my daughter
Valentine."</p>

<p id="id10635">"Ah, sir," exclaimed Madame de Villefort, clasping her hands, "what do
you say?"</p>

<p id="id10636">"It is not for you to interrogate, but to answer."</p>

<p id="id10637">"Is it to the judge or to the husband?" stammered Madame de Villefort.
"To the judge&#8212;to the judge, madame!" It was terrible to behold the
frightful pallor of that woman, the anguish of her look, the trembling
of her whole frame. "Ah, sir," she muttered, "ah, sir," and this was
all.</p>

<p id="id10638">"You do not answer, madame!" exclaimed the terrible interrogator. Then
he added, with a smile yet more terrible than his anger, "It is true,
then; you do not deny it!" She moved forward. "And you cannot deny it!"
added Villefort, extending his hand toward her, as though to seize her
in the name of justice. "You have accomplished these different crimes
with impudent address, but which could only deceive those whose
affections for you blinded them. Since the death of Madame de
Saint-Meran, I have known that a poisoner lived in my house. M.
d'Avrigny warned me of it. After the death of Barrois my suspicions were
directed towards an angel,&#8212;those suspicions which, even when there
is no crime, are always alive in my heart; but after the death of
Valentine, there has been no doubt in my mind, madame, and not only in
mine, but in those of others; thus your crime, known by two persons,
suspected by many, will soon become public, and, as I told you just now,
you no longer speak to the husband, but to the judge."</p>

<p id="id10639">The young woman hid her face in her hands. "Oh, sir," she stammered, "I
beseech you, do not believe appearances."</p>

<p id="id10640">"Are you, then, a coward?" cried Villefort, in a contemptuous voice.
"But I have always observed that poisoners were cowards. Can you be a
coward,&#8212;you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old
men and a young girl murdered by you?"</p>

<p id="id10641">"Sir! sir!"</p>

<p id="id10642">"Can you be a coward?" continued Villefort, with increasing excitement,
"you, who could count, one by one, the minutes of four death agonies?
You, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages
with a talent and precision almost miraculous? Have you, then, who have
calculated everything with such nicety, have you forgotten to calculate
one thing&#8212;I mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to?
Oh, it is impossible&#8212;you must have saved some surer, more subtle and
deadly poison than any other, that you might escape the punishment
that you deserve. You have done this&#8212;I hope so, at least." Madame de
Villefort stretched out her hands, and fell on her knees.</p>

<p id="id10643">"I understand," he said, "you confess; but a confession made to the
judges, a confession made at the last moment, extorted when the crime
cannot be denied, diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the
guilty!"</p>

<p id="id10644">"The punishment?" exclaimed Madame de Villefort, "the punishment,
monsieur? Twice you have pronounced that word!"</p>

<p id="id10645">"Certainly. Did you hope to escape it because you were four times
guilty? Did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are
the wife of him who pronounces it?&#8212;No, madame, no; the scaffold awaits
the poisoner, whoever she may be, unless, as I just said, the poisoner
has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her
deadliest potion." Madame de Villefort uttered a wild cry, and a hideous
and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features. "Oh,
do not fear the scaffold, madame," said the magistrate; "I will not
dishonor you, since that would be dishonor to myself; no, if you have
heard me distinctly, you will understand that you are not to die on the
scaffold."</p>

<p id="id10646">"No, I do not understand; what do you mean?" stammered the unhappy
woman, completely overwhelmed. "I mean that the wife of the first
magistrate in the capital shall not, by her infamy, soil an unblemished
name; that she shall not, with one blow, dishonor her husband and her
child."</p>

<p id="id10647">"No, no&#8212;oh, no!"</p>

<p id="id10648">"Well, madame, it will be a laudable action on your part, and I will
thank you for it!"</p>

<p id="id10649">"You will thank me&#8212;for what?"</p>

<p id="id10650">"For what you have just said."</p>

<p id="id10651">"What did I say? Oh, my brain whirls; I no longer understand anything.
Oh, my God, my God!" And she rose, with her hair dishevelled, and her
lips foaming.</p>

<p id="id10652">"Have you answered the question I put to you on entering the
room?&#8212;where do you keep the poison you generally use, madame?" Madame
de Villefort raised her arms to heaven, and convulsively struck one
hand against the other. "No, no," she vociferated, "no, you cannot wish
that!"</p>

<p id="id10653">"What I do not wish, madame, is that you should perish on the scaffold.<br/>

Do you understand?" asked Villefort.<br/></p>

<p id="id10654">"Oh, mercy, mercy, monsieur!"</p>

<p id="id10655">"What I require is, that justice be done. I am on the earth to punish,
madame," he added, with a flaming glance; "any other woman, were it the
queen herself, I would send to the executioner; but to you I shall be
merciful. To you I will say, 'Have you not, madame, put aside some of
the surest, deadliest, most speedy poison?'"</p>

<p id="id10656">"Oh, pardon me, sir; let me live!"</p>

<p id="id10657">"She is cowardly," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id10658">"Reflect that I am your wife!"</p>

<p id="id10659">"You are a poisoner."</p>

<p id="id10660">"In the name of heaven!"</p>

<p id="id10661">"No!"</p>

<p id="id10662">"In the name of the love you once bore me!"</p>

<p id="id10663">"No, no!"</p>

<p id="id10664">"In the name of our child! Ah, for the sake of our child, let me live!"</p>

<p id="id10665">"No, no, no, I tell you; one day, if I allow you to live, you will
perhaps kill him, as you have the others!"</p>

<p id="id10666">"I?&#8212;I kill my boy?" cried the distracted mother, rushing toward
Villefort; "I kill my son? Ha, ha, ha!" and a frightful, demoniac laugh
finished the sentence, which was lost in a hoarse rattle. Madame de
Villefort fell at her husband's feet. He approached her. "Think of it,
madame," he said; "if, on my return, justice his not been satisfied, I
will denounce you with my own mouth, and arrest you with my own hands!"
She listened, panting, overwhelmed, crushed; her eye alone lived, and
glared horribly. "Do you understand me?" he said. "I am going down there
to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer. If I find you
alive on my return, you shall sleep to-night in the conciergerie."
Madame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the
carpet. The king's attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity;
he looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly,
"Farewell, madame, farewell!" That farewell struck Madame de Villefort
like the executioner's knife. She fainted. The procureur went out, after
having double-locked the door.</p>

<h2 id="id10667" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 109. The Assizes.</h2>

<p id="id10668">The Benedetto affair, as it was called at the Palais, and by people in
general, had produced a tremendous sensation. Frequenting the Cafe de
Paris, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his
brief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of
acquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as
the man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as every one who had been
personally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a
lively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble in
endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of his
comrade in chains. In the eyes of many, Benedetto appeared, if not
a victim to, at least an instance of, the fallibility of the law. M.
Cavalcanti, his father, had been seen in Paris, and it was expected that
he would re-appear to claim the illustrious outcast. Many, also, who
were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from Paris,
were struck with the worthy appearance, the gentlemanly bearing, and
the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician, who certainly
played the nobleman very well, so long as he said nothing, and made no
arithmetical calculations. As for the accused himself, many remembered
him as being so amiable, so handsome, and so liberal, that they chose
to think him the victim of some conspiracy, since in this world large
fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown
enemy. Every one, therefore, ran to the court; some to witness the
sight, others to comment upon it. From seven o'clock in the morning
a crowd was stationed at the iron gates, and an hour before the trial
commenced the hall was full of the privileged. Before the entrance of
the magistrates, and indeed frequently afterwards, a court of justice,
on days when some especial trial is to take place, resembles a
drawing-room where many persons recognize each other and converse if
they can do so without losing their seats; or, if they are separated by
too great a number of lawyers, communicate by signs.</p>

<p id="id10669">It was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short
summer; the clouds which M. de Villefort had perceived at sunrise
had all disappeared as if by magic, and one of the softest and most
brilliant days of September shone forth in all its splendor.</p>

<p id="id10670">Beauchamp, one of the kings of the press, and therefore claiming the
right of a throne everywhere, was eying everybody through his monocle.
He perceived Chateau-Renaud and Debray, who had just gained the good
graces of a sergeant-at-arms, and who had persuaded the latter to let
them stand before, instead of behind him, as they ought to have done.
The worthy sergeant had recognized the minister's secretary and the
millionnaire, and, by way of paying extra attention to his noble
neighbors, promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to
Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id10671">"Well," said Beauchamp, "we shall see our friend!"</p>

<p id="id10672">"Yes, indeed!" replied Debray. "That worthy prince. Deuce take those<br/>

Italian princes!"<br/></p>

<p id="id10673">"A man, too, who could boast of Dante for a genealogist, and could
reckon back to the 'Divine Comedy.'"</p>

<p id="id10674">"A nobility of the rope!" said Chateau-Renaud phlegmatically.</p>

<p id="id10675">"He will be condemned, will he not?" asked Debray of Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id10676">"My dear fellow, I think we should ask you that question; you know such
news much better than we do. Did you see the president at the minister's
last night?"</p>

<p id="id10677">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id10678">"What did he say?"</p>

<p id="id10679">"Something which will surprise you."</p>

<p id="id10680">"Oh, make haste and tell me, then; it is a long time since that has
happened."</p>

<p id="id10681">"Well, he told me that Benedetto, who is considered a serpent of
subtlety and a giant of cunning, is really but a very commonplace, silly
rascal, and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on
his phrenological organs after his death."</p>

<p id="id10682">"Bah," said Beauchamp, "he played the prince very well."</p>

<p id="id10683">"Yes, for you who detest those unhappy princes, Beauchamp, and are
always delighted to find fault with them; but not for me, who discover
a gentleman by instinct, and who scent out an aristocratic family like a
very bloodhound of heraldry."</p>

<p id="id10684">"Then you never believed in the principality?"</p>

<p id="id10685">"Yes.&#8212;in the principality, but not in the prince."</p>

<p id="id10686">"Not so bad," said Beauchamp; "still, I assure you, he passed very well
with many people; I saw him at the ministers' houses."</p>

<p id="id10687">"Ah, yes," said Chateau-Renaud. "The idea of thinking ministers
understand anything about princes!"</p>

<p id="id10688">"There is something in what you have just said," said Beauchamp,
laughing.</p>

<p id="id10689">"But," said Debray to Beauchamp, "if I spoke to the president, you must
have been with the procureur."</p>

<p id="id10690">"It was an impossibility; for the last week M. de Villefort has
secluded himself. It is natural enough; this strange chain of domestic
afflictions, followed by the no less strange death of his daughter"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10691">"Strange? What do you mean, Beauchamp?"</p>

<p id="id10692">"Oh, yes; do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the
minister's?" said Beauchamp, placing his eye-glass in his eye, where he
tried to make it remain.</p>

<p id="id10693">"My dear sir," said Chateau-Renaud, "allow me to tell you that you do
not understand that manoeuvre with the eye-glass half so well as Debray.
Give him a lesson, Debray."</p>

<p id="id10694">"Stay," said Beauchamp, "surely I am not deceived."</p>

<p id="id10695">"What is it?"</p>

<p id="id10696">"It is she!"</p>

<p id="id10697">"Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id10698">"They said she had left."</p>

<p id="id10699">"Mademoiselle Eugenie?" said Chateau-Renaud; "has she returned?"</p>

<p id="id10700">"No, but her mother."</p>

<p id="id10701">"Madame Danglars? Nonsense! Impossible!" said Chateau-Renaud; "only
ten days after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the
bankruptcy of her husband?"</p>

<p id="id10702">Debray colored slightly, and followed with his eyes the direction of
Beauchamp's glance. "Come," he said, "it is only a veiled lady, some
foreign princess, perhaps the mother of Cavalcanti. But you were just
speaking on a very interesting topic, Beauchamp."</p>

<h5 id="id10703">"I?"</h5>

<p id="id10704">"Yes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine."</p>

<p id="id10705">"Ah, yes, so I was. But how is it that Madame de Villefort is not here?"</p>

<p id="id10706">"Poor, dear woman," said Debray, "she is no doubt occupied in distilling
balm for the hospitals, or in making cosmetics for herself or friends.
Do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year in this
amusement? But I wonder she is not here. I should have been pleased to
see her, for I like her very much."</p>

<p id="id10707">"And I hate her," said Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id10708">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id10709">"I do not know. Why do we love? Why do we hate? I detest her, from
antipathy."</p>

<p id="id10710">"Or, rather, by instinct."</p>

<p id="id10711">"Perhaps so. But to return to what you were saying, Beauchamp."</p>

<p id="id10712">"Well, do you know why they die so multitudinously at M. de<br/>

Villefort's?"<br/></p>

<p id="id10713">"'Multitudinously' is good," said Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id10714">"My good fellow, you'll find the word in Saint-Simon."</p>

<p id="id10715">"But the thing itself is at M. de Villefort's; but let's get back to the
subject."</p>

<p id="id10716">"Talking of that," said Debray, "Madame was making inquiries about that
house, which for the last three months has been hung with black."</p>

<p id="id10717">"Who is Madame?" asked Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id10718">"The minister's wife, pardieu!"</p>

<p id="id10719">"Oh, your pardon! I never visit ministers; I leave that to the princes."</p>

<p id="id10720">"Really, You were only before sparkling, but now you are brilliant; take
compassion on us, or, like Jupiter, you will wither us up."</p>

<p id="id10721">"I will not speak again," said Chateau-Renaud; "pray have compassion
upon me, and do not take up every word I say."</p>

<p id="id10722">"Come, let us endeavor to get to the end of our story, Beauchamp; I
told you that yesterday Madame made inquiries of me upon the subject;
enlighten me, and I will then communicate my information to her."</p>

<p id="id10723">"Well, gentlemen, the reason people die so multitudinously (I like the
word) at M. de Villefort's is that there is an assassin in the house!"
The two young men shuddered, for the same idea had more than once
occurred to them. "And who is the assassin;" they asked together.</p>

<p id="id10724">"Young Edward!" A burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the
least disconcert the speaker, who continued,&#8212;"Yes, gentlemen; Edward,
the infant phenomenon, who is quite an adept in the art of killing."</p>

<p id="id10725">"You are jesting."</p>

<p id="id10726">"Not at all. I yesterday engaged a servant, who had just left M.
de Villefort&#8212;I intend sending him away to-morrow, for he eats so
enormously, to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in
that house. Well, now listen."</p>

<p id="id10727">"We are listening."</p>

<p id="id10728">"It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle
containing some drug, which he every now and then uses against those who
have displeased him. First, M. and Madame de Saint-Meran incurred his
displeasure, so he poured out three drops of his elixir&#8212;three drops
were sufficient; then followed Barrois, the old servant of M. Noirtier,
who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch&#8212;he therefore received the
same quantity of the elixir; the same happened to Valentine, of whom he
was jealous; he gave her the same dose as the others, and all was over
for her as well as the rest."</p>

<p id="id10729">"Why, what nonsense are you telling us?" said Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id10730">"Yes, it is an extraordinary story," said Beauchamp; "is it not?"</p>

<p id="id10731">"It is absurd," said Debray.</p>

<p id="id10732">"Ah," said Beauchamp, "you doubt me? Well, you can ask my servant, or
rather him who will no longer be my servant to-morrow, it was the talk
of the house."</p>

<p id="id10733">"And this elixir, where is it? what is it?"</p>

<p id="id10734">"The child conceals it."</p>

<p id="id10735">"But where did he find it?"</p>

<p id="id10736">"In his mother's laboratory."</p>

<p id="id10737">"Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?"</p>

<p id="id10738">"How can I tell? You are questioning me like a king's attorney. I only
repeat what I have been told, and like my informant I can do no more.
The poor devil would eat nothing, from fear."</p>

<p id="id10739">"It is incredible!"</p>

<p id="id10740">"No, my dear fellow, it is not at all incredible. You saw the child pass
through the Rue Richelieu last year, who amused himself with killing his
brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept.
The generation who follow us are very precocious."</p>

<p id="id10741">"Come, Beauchamp," said Chateau-Renaud, "I will bet anything you do not
believe a word of all you have been telling us."</p>

<p id="id10742">"I do not see the Count of Monte Cristo here."</p>

<p id="id10743">"He is worn out," said Debray; "besides, he could not well appear in
public, since he has been the dupe of the Cavalcanti, who, it appears,
presented themselves to him with false letters of credit, and cheated
him out of 100,000. francs upon the hypothesis of this principality."</p>

<p id="id10744">"By the way, M. de Chateau-Renaud," asked Beauchamp, "how is Morrel?"</p>

<p id="id10745">"Ma foi, I have called three times without once seeing him. Still, his
sister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not seen him
for two or three days, she was sure he was well."</p>

<p id="id10746">"Ah, now I think of it, the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the
hall," said Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id10747">"Why not?"</p>

<p id="id10748">"Because he is an actor in the drama."</p>

<p id="id10749">"Has he assassinated any one, then?"</p>

<p id="id10750">"No, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. You know that
it was in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his
friend Benedetto. You know that the famous waistcoat was found in
his house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of
the marriage-contract. Do you see the waistcoat? There it is, all
blood-stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime."</p>

<p id="id10751">"Ah, very good."</p>

<p id="id10752">"Hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places." A
noise was heard in the hall; the sergeant called his two patrons with
an energetic "hem!" and the door-keeper appearing, called out with that
shrill voice peculiar to his order, ever since the days of Beaumarchais,
"The court, gentlemen!"</p>
