<p id="id05834">"What," said the notary, "do you not intend making Mademoiselle<br/>

Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee?"<br/></p>

<p id="id05835">"No."</p>

<p id="id05836">"You are not making any mistake, are you?" said the notary; "you really
mean to declare that such is not your intention?"</p>

<p id="id05837">"No," repeated Noirtier; "No." Valentine raised her head, struck dumb
with astonishment. It was not so much the conviction that she was
disinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability to account
for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act. But
Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she
exclaimed, "Oh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of
which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which I have always
enjoyed."</p>

<p id="id05838">"Ah, yes, most assuredly," said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed
them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake. "Thank you,
thank you," murmured she. The old man's declaration that Valentine
was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of
Madame de Villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and said:
"Then, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune
to your grandson, Edward de Villefort?" The winking of the eyes which
answered this speech was most decided and terrible, and expressed a
feeling almost amounting to hatred.</p>

<p id="id05839">"No?" said the notary; "then, perhaps, it is to your son, M. de<br/>

Villefort?"<br/></p>

<p id="id05840">"No." The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and
inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator. Villefort
and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from anger.</p>

<p id="id05841">"What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?" said Valentine; "you no
longer seem to love any of us?" The old man's eyes passed rapidly
from Villefort and his wife, and rested on Valentine with a look of
unutterable fondness. "Well," said she; "if you love me, grandpapa, try
and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment.
You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought
of your fortune; besides, they say I am already rich in right of my
mother&#8212;too rich, even. Explain yourself, then." Noirtier fixed his
intelligent eyes on Valentine's hand. "My hand?" said she.</p>

<p id="id05842">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05843">"Her hand!" exclaimed every one.</p>

<p id="id05844">"Oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father's mind is
really impaired," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05845">"Ah," cried Valentine suddenly, "I understand. It is my marriage you
mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?"</p>

<p id="id05846">"Yes, yes, yes," signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a look of
joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.</p>

<p id="id05847">"You are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?"</p>

<p id="id05848">"Yes?"</p>

<p id="id05849">"Really, this is too absurd," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05850">"Excuse me, sir," replied the notary; "on the contrary, the meaning of
M. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily connect the
train of ideas passing in his mind."</p>

<p id="id05851">"You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d'Epinay?" observed Valentine.</p>

<p id="id05852">"I do not wish it," said the eye of her grandfather. "And you disinherit
your granddaughter," continued the notary, "because she has contracted
an engagement contrary to your wishes?"</p>

<p id="id05853">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05854">"So that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?"</p>

<p id="id05855">"Yes." There was a profound silence. The two notaries were holding
a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair.
Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense
gratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while Madame
de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy,
which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance. "But,"
said Villefort, who was the first to break the silence, "I consider that
I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question. I am
the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter's hand.
It is my wish that she should marry M. Franz d'Epinay&#8212;and she shall
marry him." Valentine sank weeping into a chair.</p>

<p id="id05856">"Sir," said the notary, "how do you intend disposing of your fortune in
case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M. Franz?"
The old man gave no answer. "You will, of course, dispose of it in some
way or other?"</p>

<p id="id05857">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05858">"In favor of some member of your family?"</p>

<p id="id05859">"No."</p>

<p id="id05860">"Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?" pursued the
notary.</p>

<p id="id05861">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05862">"But," said the notary, "you are aware that the law does not allow a son
to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?"</p>

<p id="id05863">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05864">"You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which
the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?"
Noirtier made no answer. "Do you still wish to dispose of all?"</p>

<p id="id05865">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05866">"But they will contest the will after your death?"</p>

<p id="id05867">"No."</p>

<p id="id05868">"My father knows me," replied Villefort; "he is quite sure that his
wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my
position I cannot plead against the poor." The eye of Noirtier beamed
with triumph. "What do you decide on, sir?" asked the notary of
Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05869">"Nothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know
he never alters his mind. I am quite resigned. These 900,000 francs
will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is
ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man, and I shall,
therefore, act according to my conscience." Having said this, Villefort
quitted the room with his wife, leaving his father at liberty to do as
he pleased. The same day the will was made, the witnesses were brought,
it was approved by the old man, sealed in the presence of all and given
in charge to M. Deschamps, the family notary.</p>

<h2 id="id05870" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 60. The Telegraph.</h2>

<p id="id05871">M. and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte
Cristo, who had come to visit them in their absence, had been ushered
into the drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there. Madame de
Villefort, who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion
to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately, retired to her
bedroom, while the procureur, who could better depend upon himself,
proceeded at once to the salon. Although M. de Villefort flattered
himself that, to all outward view, he had completely masked the feelings
which were passing in his mind, he did not know that the cloud was
still lowering on his brow, so much so that the count, whose smile was
radiant, immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air. "Ma foi,"
said Monte Cristo, after the first compliments were over, "what is the
matter with you, M. de Villefort? Have I arrived at the moment when you
were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime?" Villefort tried to
smile. "No, count," he replied, "I am the only victim in this case. It
is I who lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which
have caused it to be decided against me."</p>

<p id="id05872">"To what do you refer?" said Monte Cristo with well-feigned interest.<br/>

"Have you really met with some great misfortune?"<br/></p>

<p id="id05873">"Oh, no, monsieur," said Villefort with a bitter smile; "it is only a
loss of money which I have sustained&#8212;nothing worth mentioning, I assure
you."</p>

<p id="id05874">"True," said Monte Cristo, "the loss of a sum of money becomes almost
immaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one of your
philosophic spirit."</p>

<p id="id05875">"It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me," said Villefort,
"though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting; but I am the
more annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please to call the
power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may blast the
prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old man
relapsed into second childhood."</p>

<p id="id05876">"What do you say?" said the count; "900,000 francs? It is indeed a sum
which might be regretted even by a philosopher. And who is the cause of
all this annoyance?"</p>

<p id="id05877">"My father, as I told you."</p>

<p id="id05878">"M. Noirtier? But I thought you told me he had become entirely
paralyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?"</p>

<p id="id05879">"Yes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak,
nevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner I have described.
I left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating
his will to two notaries."</p>

<p id="id05880">"But to do this he must have spoken?"</p>

<p id="id05881">"He has done better than that&#8212;he has made himself understood."</p>

<p id="id05882">"How was such a thing possible?"</p>

<p id="id05883">"By the help of his eyes, which are still full of life, and, as you
perceive, possess the power of inflicting mortal injury."</p>

<p id="id05884">"My dear," said Madame de Villefort, who had just entered the room,
"perhaps you exaggerate the evil."</p>

<p id="id05885">"Good-morning, madame," said the count, bowing. Madame de Villefort
acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles. "What
is this that M. de Villefort has been telling me?" demanded Monte Cristo
"and what incomprehensible misfortune"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05886">"Incomprehensible is not the word," interrupted the procureur, shrugging
his shoulders. "It is an old man's caprice."</p>

<p id="id05887">"And is there no means of making him revoke his decision?"</p>

<p id="id05888">"Yes," said Madame de Villefort; "and it is still entirely in the power
of my husband to cause the will, which is now in prejudice of Valentine,
to be altered in her favor." The count, who perceived that M. and Madame
de Villefort were beginning to speak in parables, appeared to pay no
attention to the conversation, and feigned to be busily engaged in
watching Edward, who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird's
water-glass. "My dear," said Villefort, in answer to his wife, "you know
I have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor
have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by
my nod. Nevertheless, it is necessary that my will should be respected
in my family, and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of
a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have
entertained for so many years. The Baron d'Epinay was my friend, as you
know, and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could
possibly be arranged."</p>

<p id="id05889">"Do you think," said Madame de Villefort, "that Valentine is in league
with him? She has always been opposed to this marriage, and I should not
be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but
the execution of a plan concerted between them."</p>

<p id="id05890">"Madame," said Villefort, "believe me, a fortune of 900,000. francs is
not so easily renounced."</p>

<p id="id05891">"She could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir,
since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a
convent."</p>

<p id="id05892">"Never mind," replied Villefort; "I say that this marriage shall be
consummated."</p>

<p id="id05893">"Notwithstanding your father's wishes to the contrary?" said Madame de
Villefort, selecting a new point of attack. "That is a serious thing."
Monte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every
word that was said. "Madame," replied Villefort "I can truly say that
I have always entertained a high respect for my father, because, to the
natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral
superiority. The name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be
reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to
obey. But, under the present circumstances, I am justified in doubting
the wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his
anger on the son. It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct
by such caprices. I shall still continue to preserve the same respect
toward M. Noirtier; I will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary
deprivation to which he has subjected me; but I shall remain firm in
my determination, and the world shall see which party has reason on
his side. Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz
d'Epinay, because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match
for her to make, and, in short, because I choose to bestow my daughter's
hand on whomever I please."</p>

<p id="id05894">"What?" said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort had
frequently solicited during this speech. "What? Do you say that M.
Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to
marry M. le Baron Franz d'Epinay?"</p>

<p id="id05895">"Yes, sir, that is the reason," said Villefort, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p id="id05896">"The apparent reason, at least," said Madame de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05897">"The real reason, madame, I can assure you; I know my father."</p>

<p id="id05898">"But I want to know in what way M. d'Epinay can have displeased your
father more than any other person?"</p>

<p id="id05899">"I believe I know M. Franz d'Epinay," said the count; "is he not the son
of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d'Epinay by Charles X.?"</p>

<p id="id05900">"The same," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05901">"Well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas."</p>

<p id="id05902">"He is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier
to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in
their affection," said Madame de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05903">"But," said Monte Cristo "do you not know any cause for this hatred?"</p>

<p id="id05904">"Ah, ma foi, who is to know?"</p>

<p id="id05905">"Perhaps it is some political difference?"</p>

<p id="id05906">"My father and the Baron d'Epinay lived in the stormy times of which I
only saw the ending," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05907">"Was not your father a Bonapartist?" asked Monte Cristo; "I think I
remember that you told me something of that kind."</p>

<p id="id05908">"My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else," said Villefort,
carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; "and the senator's
robe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to disguise the
old man without in any degree changing him. When my father conspired,
it was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for M. Noirtier
possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian schemes which
could never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and he applied
to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The
Mountain,&#8212;theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed
necessary to bring about the desired result."</p>

<p id="id05909">"Well," said Monte Cristo, "it is just as I thought; it was politics
which brought Noirtier and M. d'Epinay into personal contact. Although
General d'Epinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain royalist
sentiments? And was he not the person who was assassinated one evening
on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the
supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?" Villefort looked
at the count almost with terror. "Am I mistaken, then?" said Monte
Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05910">"No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated," said Madame
de Villefort; "and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M. de
Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two
children of these inveterate enemies."</p>

<p id="id05911">"It was a sublime and charitable thought," said Monte Cristo, "and the
whole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see Mademoiselle
Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d'Epinay."
Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read
in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he
had just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and
prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying
smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming. "Although,"
said Villefort, "it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose
her grandfather's fortune, I do not think that M. d'Epinay will be
frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in greater
esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice everything in
order to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that Valentine is rich
in right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit
the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Meran, her mother's parents, who
both love her tenderly."</p>

<p id="id05912">"And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,"
said Madame de Villefort; "besides, they are to come to Paris in about
a month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not
consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up
with M. Noirtier." The count listened with satisfaction to this tale
of wounded self-love and defeated ambition. "But it seems to me," said
Monte Cristo, "and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am
about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort
because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he cannot
have the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward."</p>

<p id="id05913">"True," said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it
is impossible to describe; "is it not unjust&#8212;shamefully unjust? Poor
Edward is as much M. Noirtier's grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if she
had not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left
her all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her
grandfather, she will still be three times richer than he." The count
listened and said no more. "Count," said Villefort, "we will not
entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes. It is true that my
patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions, and my father will
have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing
so, but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like
a man of sense and feeling. M. d'Epinay, to whom I had promised the
interest of this sum, shall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel
privations."</p>

<p id="id05914">"However," said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea which
incessantly occupied her mind, "perhaps it would be better to explain
this unlucky affair to M. d'Epinay, in order to give him the opportunity
of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de
Villefort."</p>

<p id="id05915">"Ah, that would be a great pity," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05916">"A great pity," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05917">"Undoubtedly," said Villefort, moderating the tones of his voice, "a
marriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort of discredit
on a young lady; then again, the old reports, which I was so anxious to
put an end to, will instantly gain ground. No, it will all go well; M.
d'Epinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself more than
ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort, unless he were actuated by a
decided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible."</p>

<p id="id05918">"I agree with M. de Villefort," said Monte Cristo, fixing his eyes on
Madame de Villefort; "and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to
allow of giving my advice, I would persuade him, since I have been told
M. d'Epinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once beyond all
possibility of revocation. I will answer for the success of a project
which will reflect so much honor on M. de Villefort." The procureur
arose, delighted with the proposition, but his wife slightly changed
color. "Well, that is all that I wanted, and I will be guided by a
counsellor such as you are," said he, extending his hand to Monte
Cristo. "Therefore let every one here look upon what has passed to-day
as if it had not happened, and as though we had never thought of such a
thing as a change in our original plans."</p>

<p id="id05919">"Sir," said the count, "the world, unjust as it is, will be pleased with
your resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and M. d'Epinay,
even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry, which he
will not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering a family
which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a
duty." At the conclusion of these words, the count rose to depart. "Are
you going to leave us, count?" said Madame de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05920">"I am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you of
your promise for Saturday."</p>

<p id="id05921">"Did you fear that we should forget it?"</p>

<p id="id05922">"You are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many important
and urgent occupations."</p>

<p id="id05923">"My husband has given me his word, sir," said Madame de Villefort; "you
have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose,
and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything
to gain."</p>

<p id="id05924">"And," said Villefort, "is it at your house in the Champs-Elysees that
you receive your visitors?"</p>

<p id="id05925">"No," said Monte Cristo, "which is precisely the reason which renders
your kindness more meritorious,&#8212;it is in the country."</p>

<p id="id05926">"In the country?"</p>

<p id="id05927">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05928">"Where is it, then? Near Paris, is it not?"</p>

<p id="id05929">"Very near, only half a league from the Barriers,&#8212;it is at Auteuil."</p>

<p id="id05930">"At Auteuil?" said Villefort; "true, Madame de Villefort told me you
lived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken. And in
what part of Auteuil do you reside?"</p>

<p id="id05931">"Rue de la Fontaine."</p>

<p id="id05932">"Rue de la Fontaine!" exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone; "at what
number?"</p>

<p id="id05933">"No. 28."</p>

<p id="id05934">"Then," cried Villefort, "was it you who bought M. de Saint-Meran's
house!"</p>

<p id="id05935">"Did it belong to M. de Saint-Meran?" demanded Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05936">"Yes," replied Madame de Villefort; "and, would you believe it, count"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05937">"Believe what?"</p>

<p id="id05938">"You think this house pretty, do you not?"</p>

<p id="id05939">"I think it charming."</p>

<p id="id05940">"Well, my husband would never live in it."</p>

<p id="id05941">"Indeed?" returned Monte Cristo, "that is a prejudice on your part, M.
de Villefort, for which I am quite at a loss to account."</p>

<p id="id05942">"I do not like Auteuil, sir," said the procureur, making an evident
effort to appear calm.</p>

<p id="id05943">"But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of
the pleasure of your company, sir," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05944">"No, count,&#8212;I hope&#8212;I assure you I shall do my best," stammered<br/>

Villefort.<br/></p>

<p id="id05945">"Oh," said Monte Cristo, "I allow of no excuse. On Saturday, at six
o'clock. I shall be expecting you, and if you fail to come, I shall
think&#8212;for how do I know to the contrary?&#8212;that this house, which his
remained uninhabited for twenty years, must have some gloomy tradition
or dreadful legend connected with it."</p>

<p id="id05946">"I will come, count,&#8212;I will be sure to come," said Villefort eagerly.</p>

<p id="id05947">"Thank you," said Monte Cristo; "now you must permit me to take my leave
of you."</p>

<p id="id05948">"You said before that you were obliged to leave us, monsieur," said
Madame de Villefort, "and you were about to tell us why when your
attention was called to some other subject."</p>

<p id="id05949">"Indeed madame," said Monte Cristo: "I scarcely know if I dare tell you
where I am going."</p>

<p id="id05950">"Nonsense; say on."</p>

<p id="id05951">"Well, then, it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for
hours together."</p>

<p id="id05952">"What is it?"</p>

<p id="id05953">"A telegraph. So now I have told my secret."</p>

<p id="id05954">"A telegraph?" repeated Madame de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05955">"Yes, a telegraph. I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on
a hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every
direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I
assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could
not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should
be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the
distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting
at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the
opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition
on the part of the sender of the message. I began to think of genii,
sylphs, gnomes, in short, of all the ministers of the occult sciences,
until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination. Now, it never
occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects,
with their long black claws, for I always feared to find under their
stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals,
factions, and government intrigues. But one fine day I learned that the
mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred
francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the heavens like
an astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler, or even in
enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him, but all his
monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied, black-clawed
fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him. At length I felt
a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely, and to endeavor
to understand the secret part played by these insect-actors when they
occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string."</p>

<p id="id05956">"And are you going there?"</p>

<p id="id05957">"I am."</p>

<p id="id05958">"What telegraph do you intend visiting? that of the home department, or
of the observatory?"</p>

<p id="id05959">"Oh, no; I should find there people who would force me to understand
things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant, and who would try
to explain to me, in spite of myself, a mystery which even they do
not understand. Ma foi, I should wish to keep my illusions concerning
insects unimpaired; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I
had formed of my fellow-creatures. I shall, therefore, not visit either
of these telegraphs, but one in the open country where I shall find
a good-natured simpleton, who knows no more than the machine he is
employed to work."</p>

<p id="id05960">"You are a singular man," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id05961">"What line would you advise me to study?"</p>

<p id="id05962">"The one that is most in use just at this time."</p>

<p id="id05963">"The Spanish one, you mean, I suppose?"</p>

<p id="id05964">"Yes; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain
to you"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05965">"No," said Monte Cristo; "since, as I told you before, I do not wish to
comprehend it. The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a
telegraph for me; it will be nothing more than a sign from M. Duchatel,
or from M. Montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne, mystified
by two Greek words, tele, graphein. It is the insect with black claws,
and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its
purity and all its importance."</p>

<p id="id05966">"Go then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you will
not be able to see anything."</p>

<p id="id05967">"Ma foi, you frighten me. Which is the nearest way? Bayonne?"</p>

<p id="id05968">"Yes; the road to Bayonne."</p>

<p id="id05969">"And afterwards the road to Chatillon?"</p>

<p id="id05970">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05971">"By the tower of Montlhery, you mean?"</p>

<p id="id05972">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05973">"Thank you. Good-by. On Saturday I will tell you my impressions
concerning the telegraph." At the door the count was met by the two
notaries, who had just completed the act which was to disinherit
Valentine, and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a
thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit.</p>

<h2 id="id05974" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 61. How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His Peaches.</h2>

<p id="id05975">Not on the same night, as he had intended, but the next morning, the
Count of Monte Cristo went out by the Barrier d'Enfer, taking the
road to Orleans. Leaving the village of Linas, without stopping at the
telegraph, which flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count
reached the tower of Montlhery, situated, as every one knows, upon the
highest point of the plain of that name. At the foot of the hill the
count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path, about
eighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself
stopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and
white flowers.</p>

<p id="id05976">Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure, and was not long
in finding a little wooden gate, working on willow hinges, and fastened
with a nail and string. The count soon mastered the mechanism, the gate
opened, and he then found himself in a little garden, about twenty feet
long by twelve wide, bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which
contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate, and on the
other by the old tower, covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers.
No one would have thought in looking at this old, weather-beaten,
floral-decked tower (which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed
up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast) that it would have
been capable of telling strange things, if,&#8212;in addition to the menacing
ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with,&#8212;it had also a
voice. The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel, edged by a border
of thick box, of many years' growth, and of a tone and color that would
have delighted the heart of Delacroix, our modern Rubens. This path was
formed in the shape of the figure of 8, thus, in its windings, making a
walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty.</p>

<p id="id05977">Never had Flora, the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners, been
honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid
to her in this little enclosure. In fact, of the twenty rose-trees which
formed the parterre, not one bore the mark of the slug, nor were there
evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to
plants growing in a damp soil. And yet it was not because the damp
had been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as soot, the
thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides, had natural
humidity been wanting, it could have been immediately supplied by
artificial means, thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of the corners
of the garden, and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad, who,
from antipathy, no doubt, always remained on the two opposite sides of
the basin. There was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths, or
a weed in the flower-beds; no fine lady ever trained and watered her
geraniums, her cacti, and her rhododendrons, with more pains than this
hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure. Monte
Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to
the nail, and cast a look around.</p>

<p id="id05978">"The man at the telegraph," said he, "must either engage a gardener or
devote himself passionately to agriculture." Suddenly he struck against
something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves; the
something rose, uttering an exclamation of astonishment, and Monte
Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old, who was
plucking strawberries, which he was placing upon grape leaves. He had
twelve leaves and about as many strawberries, which, on rising suddenly,
he let fall from his hand. "You are gathering your crop, sir?" said
Monte Cristo, smiling.</p>

<p id="id05979">"Excuse me, sir," replied the man, raising his hand to his cap; "I am
not up there, I know, but I have only just come down."</p>

<p id="id05980">"Do not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend," said the
count; "gather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any left."</p>

<p id="id05981">"I have ten left," said the man, "for here are eleven, and I had
twenty-one, five more than last year. But I am not surprised; the spring
has been warm this year, and strawberries require heat, sir. This is the
reason that, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have this year,
you see, eleven, already plucked&#8212;twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Ah, I miss three, they were here last
night, sir&#8212;I am sure they were here&#8212;I counted them. It must be the
Mere Simon's son who has stolen them; I saw him strolling about here
this morning. Ah, the young rascal&#8212;stealing in a garden&#8212;he does not
know where that may lead him to."</p>

<p id="id05982">"Certainly, it is wrong," said Monte Cristo, "but you should take into
consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent."</p>

<p id="id05983">"Of course," said the gardener, "but that does not make it the less
unpleasant. But, sir, once more I beg pardon; perhaps you are an officer
that I am detaining here." And he glanced timidly at the count's blue
coat.</p>

<p id="id05984">"Calm yourself, my friend," said the count, with the smile which he made
at will either terrible or benevolent, and which now expressed only the
kindliest feeling; "I am not an inspector, but a traveller, brought
here by a curiosity he half repents of, since he causes you to lose your
time."</p>

<p id="id05985">"Ah, my time is not valuable," replied the man with a melancholy smile.
"Still it belongs to government, and I ought not to waste it; but,
having received the signal that I might rest for an hour" (here he
glanced at the sun-dial, for there was everything in the enclosure of
Montlhery, even a sun-dial), "and having ten minutes before me, and my
strawberries being ripe, when a day longer&#8212;by-the-by, sir, do you think
dormice eat them?"</p>

<p id="id05986">"Indeed, I should think not," replied Monte Cristo; "dormice are bad
neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the Romans did."</p>

<p id="id05987">"What? Did the Romans eat them?" said the gardener&#8212;"ate dormice?"</p>

<p id="id05988">"I have read so in Petronius," said the count.</p>

<p id="id05989">"Really? They can't be nice, though they do say 'as fat as a dormouse.'
It is not a wonder they are fat, sleeping all day, and only waking to
eat all night. Listen. Last year I had four apricots&#8212;they stole one, I
had one nectarine, only one&#8212;well, sir, they ate half of it on the wall;
a splendid nectarine&#8212;I never ate a better."</p>

<p id="id05990">"You ate it?"</p>

<p id="id05991">"That is to say, the half that was left&#8212;you understand; it was
exquisite, sir. Ah, those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels; like
Mere Simon's son, who has not chosen the worst strawberries. But this
year," continued the horticulturist, "I'll take care it shall not
happen, even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch
when the strawberries are ripe." Monte Cristo had seen enough. Every man
has a devouring passion in his heart, as every fruit has its worm;
that of the telegraph man was horticulture. He began gathering the
grape-leaves which screened the sun from the grapes, and won the heart
of the gardener. "Did you come here, sir, to see the telegraph?" he
said.</p>

<p id="id05992">"Yes, if it isn't contrary to the rules."</p>

<p id="id05993">"Oh, no," said the gardener; "not in the least, since there is no danger
that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying."</p>

<p id="id05994">"I have been told," said the count, "that you do not always yourselves
understand the signals you repeat."</p>

<p id="id05995">"That is true, sir, and that is what I like best," said the man,
smiling.</p>

<p id="id05996">"Why do you like that best?"</p>

<p id="id05997">"Because then I have no responsibility. I am a machine then, and nothing
else, and so long as I work, nothing more is required of me."</p>

<p id="id05998">"Is it possible," said Monte Cristo to himself, "that I can have met
with a man that has no ambition? That would spoil my plans."</p>

<p id="id05999">"Sir," said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, "the ten minutes are
almost up; I must return to my post. Will you go up with me?"</p>

<p id="id06000">"I follow you." Monte Cristo entered the tower, which was divided into
three stories. The tower contained implements, such as spades, rakes,
watering-pots, hung against the wall; this was all the furniture. The
second was the man's conventional abode, or rather sleeping-place; it
contained a few poor articles of household furniture&#8212;a bed, a table,
two chairs, a stone pitcher&#8212;and some dry herbs, hung up to the ceiling,
which the count recognized as sweet pease, and of which the good man was
preserving the seeds; he had labelled them with as much care as if he
had been master botanist in the Jardin des Plantes.</p>

<p id="id06001">"Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing?" asked<br/>

Monte Cristo.<br/></p>

<p id="id06002">"The study does not take long; it was acting as a supernumerary that was
so tedious."</p>

<p id="id06003">"And what is the pay?"</p>

<p id="id06004">"A thousand francs, sir."</p>

<p id="id06005">"It is nothing."</p>

<p id="id06006">"No; but then we are lodged, as you perceive."</p>

<p id="id06007">Monte Cristo looked at the room. They passed to the third story; it was
the telegraph room. Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles
by which the machine was worked. "It is very interesting," he said, "but
it must be very tedious for a lifetime."</p>

<p id="id06008">"Yes. At first my neck was cramped with looking at it, but at the end
of a year I became used to it; and then we have our hours of recreation,
and our holidays."</p>

<p id="id06009">"Holidays?"</p>

<p id="id06010">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id06011">"When?"</p>

<p id="id06012">"When we have a fog."</p>

<p id="id06013">"Ah, to be sure."</p>

<p id="id06014">"Those are indeed holidays to me; I go into the garden, I plant, I
prune, I trim, I kill the insects all day long."</p>

<p id="id06015">"How long have you been here?"</p>

<p id="id06016">"Ten years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen."</p>

<p id="id06017">"You are&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id06018">"Fifty-five years old."</p>

<p id="id06019">"How long must you have served to claim the pension?"</p>

<p id="id06020">"Oh, sir, twenty-five years."</p>

<p id="id06021">"And how much is the pension?"</p>

<p id="id06022">"A hundred crowns."</p>

<p id="id06023">"Poor humanity!" murmured Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06024">"What did you say, sir?" asked the man.</p>

<p id="id06025">"I was saying it was very interesting."</p>

<p id="id06026">"What was?"</p>

<p id="id06027">"All you were showing me. And you really understand none of these
signals?"</p>

<p id="id06028">"None at all."</p>

<p id="id06029">"And have you never tried to understand them?"</p>

<p id="id06030">"Never. Why should I?"</p>

<p id="id06031">"But still there are some signals only addressed to you."</p>

<p id="id06032">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id06033">"And do you understand them?"</p>

<p id="id06034">"They are always the same."</p>

<p id="id06035">"And they mean&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id06036">"Nothing new; You have an hour; or To-morrow."</p>

<p id="id06037">"This is simple enough," said the count; "but look, is not your
correspondent putting itself in motion?"</p>

<p id="id06038">"Ah, yes; thank you, sir."</p>

<p id="id06039">"And what is it saying&#8212;anything you understand?"</p>

<p id="id06040">"Yes; it asks if I am ready."</p>

<p id="id06041">"And you reply?"</p>

<p id="id06042">"By the same sign, which, at the same time, tells my right-hand
correspondent that I am ready, while it gives notice to my left-hand
correspondent to prepare in his turn."</p>

<p id="id06043">"It is very ingenious," said the count.</p>

<p id="id06044">"You will see," said the man proudly; "in five minutes he will speak."</p>

<p id="id06045">"I have, then, five minutes," said Monte Cristo to himself; "it is
more time than I require. My dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a
question?"</p>

<p id="id06046">"What is it, sir?"</p>

<p id="id06047">"You are fond of gardening?"</p>

<p id="id06048">"Passionately."</p>

<p id="id06049">"And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty
feet, an enclosure of two acres?"</p>

<p id="id06050">"Sir, I should make a terrestrial paradise of it."</p>

<p id="id06051">"You live badly on your thousand francs?"</p>

<p id="id06052">"Badly enough; but yet I do live."</p>

<p id="id06053">"Yes; but you have a wretchedly small garden."</p>

<p id="id06054">"True, the garden is not large."</p>

<p id="id06055">"And, then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat
everything."</p>

<p id="id06056">"Ah, they are my scourges."</p>

<p id="id06057">"Tell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your
right-hand correspondent was telegraphing"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06058">"I should not see him."</p>

<p id="id06059">"Then what would happen?"</p>

<p id="id06060">"I could not repeat the signals."</p>

<p id="id06061">"And then?"</p>

<p id="id06062">"Not having repeated them, through negligence, I should be fined."</p>

<p id="id06063">"How much?"</p>

<p id="id06064">"A hundred francs."</p>

<p id="id06065">"The tenth of your income&#8212;that would be fine work."</p>

<p id="id06066">"Ah," said the man.</p>

<p id="id06067">"Has it ever happened to you?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06068">"Once, sir, when I was grafting a rose-tree."</p>

<p id="id06069">"Well, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute another?"</p>

<p id="id06070">"Ah, that is another case; I should be turned off, and lose my pension."</p>

<p id="id06071">"Three hundred francs?"</p>

<p id="id06072">"A hundred crowns, yes, sir; so you see that I am not likely to do any
of these things."</p>

<p id="id06073">"Not even for fifteen years' wages? Come, it is worth thinking about?"</p>

<p id="id06074">"For fifteen thousand francs?"</p>

<p id="id06075">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id06076">"Sir, you alarm me."</p>

<p id="id06077">"Nonsense."</p>

<p id="id06078">"Sir, you are tempting me?"</p>

<p id="id06079">"Just so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?"</p>

<p id="id06080">"Sir, let me see my right-hand correspondent."</p>

<p id="id06081">"On the contrary, do not look at him, but at this."</p>

<p id="id06082">"What is it?"</p>

<p id="id06083">"What? Do you not know these bits of paper?"</p>

<p id="id06084">"Bank-notes!"</p>

<p id="id06085">"Exactly; there are fifteen of them."</p>

<p id="id06086">"And whose are they?"</p>

<p id="id06087">"Yours, if you like."</p>

<p id="id06088">"Mine?" exclaimed the man, half-suffocated.</p>

<p id="id06089">"Yes; yours&#8212;your own property."</p>

<p id="id06090">"Sir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling."</p>

<p id="id06091">"Let him signal."</p>

<p id="id06092">"Sir, you have distracted me; I shall be fined."</p>

<p id="id06093">"That will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your interest to
take my bank-notes."</p>

<p id="id06094">"Sir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is
impatient."</p>

<p id="id06095">"Never mind&#8212;take these;" and the count placed the packet in the man's
hands. "Now this is not all," he said; "you cannot live upon your
fifteen thousand francs."</p>

<p id="id06096">"I shall still have my place."</p>

<p id="id06097">"No, you will lose it, for you are going to alter your correspondent's
message."</p>

<p id="id06098">"Oh, sir, what are you proposing?"</p>

<p id="id06099">"A jest."</p>

<p id="id06100">"Sir, unless you force me"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06101">"I think I can effectually force you;" and Monte Cristo drew another
packet from his pocket. "Here are ten thousand more francs," he said,
"with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket, they will make
twenty-five thousand. With five thousand you can buy a pretty little
house with two acres of land; the remaining twenty thousand will bring
you in a thousand francs a year."</p>

<p id="id06102">"A garden with two acres of land!"</p>

<p id="id06103">"And a thousand francs a year."</p>

<p id="id06104">"Oh, heavens!"</p>

<p id="id06105">"Come, take them," and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes into his hand.</p>

<p id="id06106">"What am I to do?"</p>

<p id="id06107">"Nothing very difficult."</p>

<p id="id06108">"But what is it?"</p>

<p id="id06109">"To repeat these signs." Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket,
upon which were drawn three signs, with numbers to indicate the order in
which they were to be worked.</p>

<p id="id06110">"There, you see it will not take long."</p>

<p id="id06111">"Yes; but"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06112">"Do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest." The shot
told; red with fever, while the large drops fell from his brow, the man
executed, one after the other, the three signs given by the count, in
spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand correspondent, who,
not understanding the change, began to think the gardener had gone mad.
As to the left-hand one, he conscientiously repeated the same signals,
which were finally transmitted to the Minister of the Interior. "Now you
are rich," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06113">"Yes," replied the man, "but at what a price!"</p>

<p id="id06114">"Listen, friend," said Monte Cristo. "I do not wish to cause you any
remorse; believe me, then, when I swear to you that you have wronged no
man, but on the contrary have benefited mankind." The man looked at the
bank-notes, felt them, counted them, turned pale, then red, then rushed
into his room to drink a glass of water, but he had no time to reach
the water-jug, and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs. Five minutes
after the new telegram reached the minister, Debray had the horses put
to his carriage, and drove to Danglars' house.</p>

<p id="id06115">"Has your husband any Spanish bonds?" he asked of the baroness.</p>

<p id="id06116">"I think so, indeed! He has six millions' worth."</p>

<p id="id06117">"He must sell them at whatever price."</p>

<p id="id06118">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id06119">"Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges, and has returned to Spain."</p>

<p id="id06120">"How do you know?" Debray shrugged his shoulders. "The idea of
asking how I hear the news," he said. The baroness did not wait for
a repetition; she ran to her husband, who immediately hastened to his
agent, and ordered him to sell at any price. When it was seen that
Danglars sold, the Spanish funds fell directly. Danglars lost five
hundred thousand francs; but he rid himself of all his Spanish shares.
The same evening the following was read in Le Messager:</p>

<p id="id06121">"[By telegraph.] The king, Don Carlos, has escaped the vigilance of
his guardians at Bourges, and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian
frontier. Barcelona has risen in his favor."</p>

<p id="id06122">All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars,
who had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only
lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow. Those who had kept
their shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as
ruined, and passed a very bad night. Next morning Le Moniteur contained
the following:</p>

<p id="id06123">"It was without any foundation that Le Messager yesterday announced the
flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The king (Don Carlos)
has not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound
peace. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to the fog,
was the cause of this error."</p>

<p id="id06124">The funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen. This,
reckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining, made the difference
of a million to Danglars. "Good," said Monte Cristo to Morrel, who was
at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of
which Danglars had been the victim, "I have just made a discovery for
twenty-five thousand francs, for which I would have paid a hundred
thousand."</p>

<p id="id06125">"What have you discovered?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id06126">"I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that
eat his peaches."</p>

<h2 id="id06127" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 62. Ghosts.</h2>

<p id="id06128">At first sight, the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no indications
of splendor, nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the
magnificent Count of Monte Cristo; but this simplicity was according
to the will of its master, who positively ordered nothing to be altered
outside. The splendor was within. Indeed, almost before the door
opened, the scene changed. M. Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste
displayed in furnishing, and in the rapidity with which it was executed.
It is told that the Duc d'Antin removed in a single night a whole avenue
of trees that annoyed Louis XIV.; in three days M. Bertuccio planted an
entirely bare court with poplars, large spreading sycamores to shade
the different parts of the house, and in the foreground, instead of the
usual paving-stones, half hidden by the grass, there extended a lawn but
that morning laid down, and upon which the water was yet glistening. For
the rest, the orders had been issued by the count; he himself had given
a plan to Bertuccio, marking the spot where each tree was to be planted,
and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the
paving-stones. Thus the house had become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio
himself declared that he scarcely knew it, encircled as it was by a
framework of trees. The overseer would not have objected, while he was
about it, to have made some improvements in the garden, but the count
had positively forbidden it to be touched. Bertuccio made amends,
however, by loading the ante-chambers, staircases, and mantle-pieces
with flowers.</p>

<p id="id06129">What, above all, manifested the shrewdness of the steward, and the
profound science of the master, the one in carrying out the ideas of the
other, was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad
and gloomy, impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to
be the smell of time, had in a single day acquired the aspect of life,
was scented with its master's favorite perfumes, and had the very light
regulated according to his wish. When the count arrived, he had
under his touch his books and arms, his eyes rested upon his favorite
pictures; his dogs, whose caresses he loved, welcomed him in the
ante-chamber; the birds, whose songs delighted him, cheered him with
their music; and the house, awakened from its long sleep, like the
sleeping beauty in the wood, lived, sang, and bloomed like the houses we
have long cherished, and in which, when we are forced to leave them,
we leave a part of our souls. The servants passed gayly along the fine
court-yard; some, belonging to the kitchens, gliding down the stairs,
restored but the previous day, as if they had always inhabited the
house; others filling the coach-houses, where the equipages, encased and
numbered, appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years; and
in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms, who spoke
to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters.</p>

<p id="id06130">The library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall, and
contained upwards of two thousand volumes; one division was entirely
devoted to novels, and even the volume which had been published but the
day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and
gold binding. On the other side of the house, to match with the library,
was the conservatory, ornamented with rare flowers, that bloomed in
china jars; and in the midst of the greenhouse, marvellous alike to
sight and smell, was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been
abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on
the cloth. One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent
Bertuccio. Before this room, to which you could ascend by the grand, and
go out by the back staircase, the servants passed with curiosity, and
Bertuccio with terror. At five o'clock precisely, the count arrived
before the house at Auteuil, followed by Ali. Bertuccio was awaiting
this arrival with impatience, mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some
compliments, while, at the same time, he feared to have frowns. Monte
Cristo descended into the courtyard, walked all over the house, without
giving any sign of approbation or pleasure, until he entered his
bedroom, situated on the opposite side to the closed room; then he
approached a little piece of furniture, made of rosewood, which he had
noticed at a previous visit. "That can only be to hold gloves," he said.</p>

<p id="id06131">"Will your excellency deign to open it?" said the delighted Bertuccio,
"and you will find gloves in it." Elsewhere the count found everything
he required&#8212;smelling-bottles, cigars, knick-knacks.</p>

<p id="id06132">"Good," he said; and M. Bertuccio left enraptured, so great, so
powerful, and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who
surrounded him. At precisely six o'clock the clatter of horses' hoofs
was heard at the entrance door; it was our captain of Spahis, who had
arrived on Medeah. "I am sure I am the first," cried Morrel; "I did it
on purpose to have you a minute to myself, before every one came. Julie
and Emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you. Ah, really this is
magnificent! But tell me, count, will your people take care of my
horse?"</p>

<p id="id06133">"Do not alarm yourself, my dear Maximilian&#8212;they understand."</p>

<p id="id06134">"I mean, because he wants petting. If you had seen at what a pace he
came&#8212;like the wind!"</p>

<p id="id06135">"I should think so,&#8212;a horse that cost 5,000 francs!" said Monte Cristo,
in the tone which a father would use towards a son.</p>

<p id="id06136">"Do you regret them?" asked Morrel, with his open laugh.</p>

<p id="id06137">"I? Certainly not," replied the count. "No; I should only regret if the
horse had not proved good."</p>

<p id="id06138">"It is so good, that I have distanced M. de Chateau-Renaud, one of the
best riders in France, and M. Debray, who both mount the minister's
Arabians; and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars,
who always go at six leagues an hour."</p>

<p id="id06139">"Then they follow you?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06140">"See, they are here." And at the same minute a carriage with smoking
horses, accompanied by two mounted gentlemen, arrived at the gate, which
opened before them. The carriage drove round, and stopped at the steps,
followed by the horsemen. The instant Debray had touched the ground,
he was at the carriage-door. He offered his hand to the baroness, who,
descending, took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to every
one but Monte Cristo. But nothing escaped the count's notice, and he
observed a little note, passed with the facility that indicates frequent
practice, from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the minister's
secretary. After his wife the banker descended, as pale as though he had
issued from his tomb instead of his carriage. Madame Danglars threw
a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by Monte
Cristo, around the court-yard, over the peristyle, and across the front
of the house, then, repressing a slight emotion, which must have been
seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color, she ascended the
steps, saying to Morrel, "Sir, if you were a friend of mine, I should
ask you if you would sell your horse."</p>

<p id="id06141">Morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace, and then turned
round to Monte Cristo, as if to ask him to extricate him from his
embarrassment. The count understood him. "Ah, madame," he said, "why did
you not make that request of me?"</p>

<p id="id06142">"With you, sir," replied the baroness, "one can wish for nothing, one is
so sure to obtain it. If it were so with M. Morrel"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06143">"Unfortunately," replied the count, "I am witness that M. Morrel cannot
give up his horse, his honor being engaged in keeping it."</p>

<p id="id06144">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id06145">"He laid a wager he would tame Medeah in the space of six months. You
understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the
time named, he would not only lose his bet, but people would say he was
afraid; and a brave captain of Spahis cannot risk this, even to
gratify a pretty woman, which is, in my opinion, one of the most sacred
obligations in the world."</p>

<p id="id06146">"You see my position, madame," said Morrel, bestowing a grateful smile
on Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06147">"It seems to me," said Danglars, in his coarse tone, ill-concealed by a
forced smile, "that you have already got horses enough." Madame Danglars
seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed, but, to the
surprise of the young people, she pretended not to hear it, and said
nothing. Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility, and showed her two
immense porcelain jars, over which wound marine plants, of a size and
delicacy that nature alone could produce. The baroness was astonished.
"Why," said she, "you could plant one of the chestnut-trees in the
Tuileries inside! How can such enormous jars have been manufactured?"</p>

<p id="id06148">"Ah, madame," replied Monte Cristo, "you must not ask of us, the
manufacturers of fine porcelain, such a question. It is the work of
another age, constructed by the genii of earth and water."</p>

<p id="id06149">"How so?&#8212;at what period can that have been?"</p>

<p id="id06150">"I do not know; I have only heard that an emperor of China had an
oven built expressly, and that in this oven twelve jars like this were
successively baked. Two broke, from the heat of the fire; the other ten
were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea. The sea, knowing
what was required of her, threw over them her weeds, encircled them with
coral, and encrusted them with shells; the whole was cemented by two
hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths, for a revolution
carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial, and only left the
documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the
sea. At the end of two hundred years the documents were found, and they
thought of bringing up the jars. Divers descended in machines, made
expressly on the discovery, into the bay where they were thrown; but of
ten three only remained, the rest having been broken by the waves. I am
fond of these jars, upon which, perhaps, misshapen, frightful monsters
have fixed their cold, dull eyes, and in which myriads of small fish
have slept, seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies."
Meanwhile, Danglars, who had cared little for curiosities, was
mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange-tree, one
after another. When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at
the cactus; but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree,
pricked him dreadfully. He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though
awaking from a dream.</p>

<p id="id06151">"Sir," said Monte Cristo to him, "I do not recommend my pictures to you,
who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are two
by Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael, a
Vandyke, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at."</p>

<p id="id06152">"Stay," said Debray; "I recognize this Hobbema."</p>

<p id="id06153">"Ah, indeed!"</p>

<p id="id06154">"Yes; it was proposed for the Museum."</p>

<p id="id06155">"Which, I believe, does not contain one?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06156">"No; and yet they refused to buy it."</p>

<p id="id06157">"Why?" said Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id06158">"You pretend not to know,&#8212;because government was not rich enough."</p>

<p id="id06159">"Ah, pardon me," said Chateau-Renaud; "I have heard of these things
every day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them
yet."</p>

<p id="id06160">"You will, by and by," said Debray.</p>

<p id="id06161">"I think not," replied Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id06162">"Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti," announced
Baptistin. A black satin stock, fresh from the maker's hands, gray
moustaches, a bold eye, a major's uniform, ornamented with three medals
and five crosses&#8212;in fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldier&#8212;such
was the appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father
with whom we are already acquainted. Close to him, dressed in entirely
new clothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful
son, whom we also know. The three young people were talking together. On
the entrance of the new-comers, their eyes glanced from father to
son, and then, naturally enough, rested on the latter, whom they began
criticising. "Cavalcanti!" said Debray. "A fine name," said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id06163">"Yes," said Chateau-Renaud, "these Italians are well named and badly
dressed."</p>

<p id="id06164">"You are fastidious, Chateau-Renaud," replied Debray; "those clothes are
well cut and quite new."</p>

<p id="id06165">"That is just what I find fault with. That gentleman appears to be well
dressed for the first time in his life."</p>

<p id="id06166">"Who are those gentlemen?" asked Danglars of Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06167">"You heard&#8212;Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id06168">"That tells me their name, and nothing else."</p>

<p id="id06169">"Ah, true. You do not know the Italian nobility; the Cavalcanti are all
descended from princes."</p>

<p id="id06170">"Have they any fortune?"</p>

<p id="id06171">"An enormous one."</p>

<p id="id06172">"What do they do?"</p>

<p id="id06173">"Try to spend it all. They have some business with you, I think, from
what they told me the day before yesterday. I, indeed, invited them here
to-day on your account. I will introduce you to them."</p>

<p id="id06174">"But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent," said<br/>

Danglars.<br/></p>

<p id="id06175">"The son has been educated in a college in the south; I believe near<br/>

Marseilles. You will find him quite enthusiastic."<br/></p>

<p id="id06176">"Upon what subject?" asked Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06177">"The French ladies, madame. He has made up his mind to take a wife from<br/>

Paris."<br/></p>

<p id="id06178">"A fine idea that of his," said Danglars, shrugging his shoulders.
Madame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which, at any
other time, would have indicated a storm, but for the second time she
controlled herself. "The baron appears thoughtful to-day," said Monte
Cristo to her; "are they going to put him in the ministry?"</p>

<p id="id06179">"Not yet, I think. More likely he has been speculating on the Bourse,
and has lost money."</p>

<p id="id06180">"M. and Madame de Villefort," cried Baptistin. They entered. M. de
Villefort, notwithstanding his self-control, was visibly affected, and
when Monte Cristo touched his hand, he felt it tremble. "Certainly,
women alone know how to dissimulate," said Monte Cristo to himself,
glancing at Madame Danglars, who was smiling on the procureur, and
embracing his wife. After a short time, the count saw Bertuccio, who,
until then, had been occupied on the other side of the house, glide into
an adjoining room. He went to him. "What do you want, M. Bertuccio?"
said he.</p>

<p id="id06181">"Your excellency has not stated the number of guests."</p>

<p id="id06182">"Ah, true."</p>

<p id="id06183">"How many covers?"</p>

<p id="id06184">"Count for yourself."</p>

<p id="id06185">"Is every one here, your excellency?"</p>

<p id="id06186">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id06187">Bertuccio glanced through the door, which was ajar. The count watched
him. "Good heavens!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id06188">"What is the matter?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id06189">"That woman&#8212;that woman!"</p>

<p id="id06190">"Which?"</p>

<p id="id06191">"The one with a white dress and so many diamonds&#8212;the fair one."</p>

<p id="id06192">"Madame Danglars?"</p>

<p id="id06193">"I do not know her name; but it is she, sir, it is she!"</p>

<p id="id06194">"Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id06195">"The woman of the garden!&#8212;she that was enciente&#8212;she who was walking
while she waited for"&#8212;Bertuccio stood at the open door, with his eyes
starting and his hair on end.</p>

<p id="id06196">"Waiting for whom?" Bertuccio, without answering, pointed to Villefort
with something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo. "Oh,
oh," he at length muttered, "do you see?"</p>

<p id="id06197">"What? Who?"</p>

<p id="id06198">"Him!"</p>

<p id="id06199">"Him!&#8212;M. de Villefort, the king's attorney? Certainly I see him."</p>

<p id="id06200">"Then I did not kill him?"</p>

<p id="id06201">"Really, I think you are going mad, good Bertuccio," said the count.</p>

<p id="id06202">"Then he is not dead?"</p>

<p id="id06203">"No; you see plainly he is not dead. Instead of striking between the
sixth and seventh left ribs, as your countrymen do, you must have struck
higher or lower, and life is very tenacious in these lawyers, or rather
there is no truth in anything you have told me&#8212;it was a fright of the
imagination, a dream of your fancy. You went to sleep full of thoughts
of vengeance; they weighed heavily upon your stomach; you had the
nightmare&#8212;that's all. Come, calm yourself, and reckon them up&#8212;M.
and Madame de Villefort, two; M. and Madame Danglars, four; M.
de Chateau-Renaud, M. Debray, M. Morrel, seven; Major Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti, eight."</p>

<p id="id06204">"Eight!" repeated Bertuccio.</p>

<p id="id06205">"Stop! You are in a shocking hurry to be off&#8212;you forget one of my
guests. Lean a little to the left. Stay! look at M. Andrea Cavalcanti,
the young man in a black coat, looking at Murillo's Madonna; now he is
turning." This time Bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation, had
not a look from Monte Cristo silenced him. "Benedetto?" he muttered;
"fatality!"</p>

<p id="id06206">"Half-past six o'clock has just struck, M. Bertuccio," said the count
severely; "I ordered dinner at that hour, and I do not like to wait;"
and he returned to his guests, while Bertuccio, leaning against the
wall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. Five minutes afterwards
the doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Bertuccio appearing
said, with a violent effort, "The dinner waits."</p>
