<p id="id01026">"I am, sir," said the king, much agitated; "and recently we have had
information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue
Saint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these
details?"</p>

<p id="id01027">"Sire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man
of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the
day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character,
and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island
of Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral
message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from
him; but this mission was to prepare men's minds for a return (it is the
man who says this, sire)&#8212;a return which will soon occur."</p>

<p id="id01028">"And where is this man?"</p>

<p id="id01029">"In prison, sire."</p>

<p id="id01030">"And the matter seems serious to you?"</p>

<p id="id01031">"So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst
of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride
and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your
majesty's feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my
devotion."</p>

<p id="id01032">"True," said Louis XVIII., "was there not a marriage engagement between
you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran?"</p>

<p id="id01033">"Daughter of one of your majesty's most faithful servants."</p>

<p id="id01034">"Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort."</p>

<p id="id01035">"Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy."</p>

<p id="id01036">"A conspiracy in these times," said Louis XVIII., smiling, "is a thing
very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch
as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have
our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future. For
the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance, in
order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If Bonaparte landed at
Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach
Piomoino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory;
if he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the result
of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population. Take
courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude."</p>

<p id="id01037">"Ah, here is M. Dandre!" cried de Blacas. At this instant the minister
of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to
faint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his hand,
restrained him.</p>

<h2 id="id01038" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 11. The Corsican Ogre.</h2>

<p id="id01039">At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently
the table at which he was sitting.</p>

<p id="id01040">"What ails you, baron?" he exclaimed. "You appear quite aghast. Has your
uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and M. de
Villefort has just confirmed?" M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the
baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of
the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his
advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that
he should humiliate the prefect.</p>

<p id="id01041">"Sire"&#8212;stammered the baron.</p>

<p id="id01042">"Well, what is it?" asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving
way to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of
Louis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.</p>

<p id="id01043">"Will you speak?" he said.</p>

<p id="id01044">"Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I can
never forgive myself!"</p>

<p id="id01045">"Monsieur," said Louis XVIII., "I command you to speak."</p>

<p id="id01046">"Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on
the 1st of March."</p>

<p id="id01047">"And where? In Italy?" asked the king eagerly.</p>

<p id="id01048">"In France, sire,&#8212;at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan."</p>

<p id="id01049">"The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two
hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only
acquired this information to-day, the 4th of March! Well, sir, what you
tell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you
have gone mad."</p>

<p id="id01050">"Alas, sire, it is but too true!" Louis made a gesture of indescribable
anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had
struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.</p>

<p id="id01051">"In France!" he cried, "the usurper in France! Then they did not watch
over this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him."</p>

<p id="id01052">"Oh, sire," exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, "M. Dandre is not a man to be
accused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of
police has shared the general blindness, that is all."</p>

<p id="id01053">"But"&#8212;said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was
silent; then he continued, "Your pardon, sire," he said, bowing, "my
zeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?"</p>

<p id="id01054">"Speak, sir, speak boldly," replied Louis. "You alone forewarned us of
the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy."</p>

<p id="id01055">"Sire," said Villefort, "the usurper is detested in the south; and it
seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to
raise Languedoc and Provence against him."</p>

<p id="id01056">"Yes, assuredly," replied the minister; "but he is advancing by Gap and<br/>

Sisteron."<br/></p>

<p id="id01057">"Advancing&#8212;he is advancing!" said Louis XVIII. "Is he then advancing on
Paris?" The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent
to a complete avowal.</p>

<p id="id01058">"And Dauphine, sir?" inquired the king, of Villefort. "Do you think it
possible to rouse that as well as Provence?"</p>

<p id="id01059">"Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling
in Dauphine is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The
mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire."</p>

<p id="id01060">"Then," murmured Louis, "he was well informed. And how many men had he
with him?"</p>

<p id="id01061">"I do not know, sire," answered the minister of police.</p>

<p id="id01062">"What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on that
point? Of course it is of no consequence," he added, with a withering
smile.</p>

<p id="id01063">"Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact
of the landing and the route taken by the usurper."</p>

<p id="id01064">"And how did this despatch reach you?" inquired the king. The minister
bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he
stammered out,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01065">"By the telegraph, sire."&#8212;Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his
arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.</p>

<p id="id01066">"So then," he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, "seven conjoined and
allied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on
the throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have,
during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the
people of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now,
when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I
hold in my hands bursts, and shatters me to atoms!"</p>

<p id="id01067">"Sire, it is fatality!" murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure
of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any
human strength to endure.</p>

<p id="id01068">"What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing,
forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself;
but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor,
who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,&#8212;for my
fortune is theirs&#8212;before me they were nothing&#8212;after me they will be
nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity&#8212;ineptitude! Oh, yes, sir,
you are right&#8212;it is fatality!"</p>

<p id="id01069">The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas wiped
the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt
his increased importance.</p>

<p id="id01070">"To fall," continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded the
abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,&#8212;"to fall, and learn of that
fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother,
Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away
by ridicule. Ridicule, sir&#8212;why, you know not its power in France, and
yet you ought to know it!"</p>

<p id="id01071">"Sire, sire," murmured the minister, "for pity's"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01072">"Approach, M. de Villefort," resumed the king, addressing the young man,
who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which
depended the destiny of a kingdom. "Approach, and tell monsieur that it
is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known."</p>

<p id="id01073">"Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man
concealed from all the world."</p>

<p id="id01074">"Really impossible! Yes&#8212;that is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there
are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really
impossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen
hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going
on at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is a
gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal&#8212;a gentleman,
only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your
police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the
power of directing a telegraph." The look of the minister of police was
turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in modest
triumph.</p>

<p id="id01075">"I do not mean that for you, Blacas," continued Louis XVIII.; "for if
you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense
to persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have
considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else
dictated by venal ambition," These words were an allusion to the
sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much
confidence an hour before.</p>

<p id="id01076">Villefort understood the king's intent. Any other person would, perhaps,
have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but
he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister,
although he saw that Dandre was irrevocably lost. In fact, the
minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth
Napoleon's secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate
Dantes and so lay bare the motives of Villefort's plot. Realizing this,
Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of
aiding to crush him.</p>

<p id="id01077">"Sire," said Villefort, "the suddenness of this event must prove to your
majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your majesty
is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing
to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted
servant&#8212;that's all. Do not attribute to me more than I deserve, sire,
that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion
you have been pleased to form of me." The minister of police thanked
the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had
succeeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the
gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of
necessity, he might rely.</p>

<p id="id01078">"'Tis well," resumed the king. "And now, gentlemen," he continued,
turning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, "I have no
further occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is
in the department of the minister of war."</p>

<p id="id01079">"Fortunately, sire," said M. de Blacas, "we can rely on the army; your
majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment."</p>

<p id="id01080">"Do not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence to
place in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned
with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?"</p>

<p id="id01081">"The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!" exclaimed Villefort, unable to
repress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, "Your pardon,
sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the
respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the
rules of etiquette."</p>

<p id="id01082">"Go on, go on, sir," replied the king; "you have to-day earned the right
to make inquiries here."</p>

<p id="id01083">"Sire," interposed the minister of police, "I came a moment ago to give
your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when
your majesty's attention was attracted by the terrible event that has
occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your
majesty."</p>

<p id="id01084">"On the contrary, sir,&#8212;on the contrary," said Louis XVIII., "this
affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies
our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps, put us on
the direct track of a great internal conspiracy." At the name of General
Quesnel, Villefort trembled.</p>

<p id="id01085">"Everything points to the conclusion, sire," said the minister of
police, "that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed,
but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a
Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been
with him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue
Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general's valet, who was dressing
his hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street
mentioned, but did not catch the number." As the police minister related
this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the
speaker's lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king looked towards
him.</p>

<p id="id01086">"Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom
they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely
devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?"</p>

<p id="id01087">"It is probable, sire," replied Villefort. "But is this all that is
known?"</p>

<p id="id01088">"They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him."</p>

<p id="id01089">"On his track?" said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id01090">"Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty
to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy
eyebrows, and a thick mustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat,
buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an
officer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly corresponding
with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the
corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Heron." Villefort
leaned on the back of an arm-chair, for as the minister of police went
on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that
the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he
breathed again.</p>

<p id="id01091">"Continue to seek for this man, sir," said the king to the minister of
police; "for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who
would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his
assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished." It required
all Villefort's coolness not to betray the terror with which this
declaration of the king inspired him.</p>

<p id="id01092">"How strange," continued the king, with some asperity; "the police think
that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, 'A murder has
been committed,' and especially so when they can add, 'And we are on the
track of the guilty persons.'"</p>

<p id="id01093">"Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at
least."</p>

<p id="id01094">"We shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you
must be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you
stopped at your father's?" A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.</p>

<p id="id01095">"No, sire," he replied, "I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue
de Tournon."</p>

<p id="id01096">"But you have seen him?"</p>

<p id="id01097">"Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas."</p>

<p id="id01098">"But you will see him, then?"</p>

<p id="id01099">"I think not, sire."</p>

<p id="id01100">"Ah, I forgot," said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all
these questions were not made without a motive; "I forgot you and
M. Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another
sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be
recompensed."</p>

<p id="id01101">"Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a
recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing
more to ask for."</p>

<p id="id01102">"Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In the
meanwhile" (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor
which he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St. Louis,
above the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and gave it
to Villefort)&#8212;"in the meanwhile take this cross."</p>

<p id="id01103">"Sire," said Villefort, "your majesty mistakes; this is an officer's
cross."</p>

<p id="id01104">"Ma foi," said Louis XVIII., "take it, such as it is, for I have not the
time to procure you another. Blacas, let it be your care to see that the
brevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort." Villefort's eyes were
filled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and kissed it.</p>

<p id="id01105">"And now," he said, "may I inquire what are the orders with which your
majesty deigns to honor me?"</p>

<p id="id01106">"Take what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able to
serve me here in Paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at
Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id01107">"Sire," replied Villefort, bowing, "in an hour I shall have quitted<br/>

Paris."<br/></p>

<p id="id01108">"Go, sir," said the king; "and should I forget you (kings' memories are
short), do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection. Baron,
send for the minister of war. Blacas, remain."</p>

<p id="id01109">"Ah, sir," said the minister of police to Villefort, as they left the<br/>

Tuileries, "you entered by luck's door&#8212;your fortune is made."<br/></p>

<p id="id01110">"Will it be long first?" muttered Villefort, saluting the minister,
whose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach.
One passed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his address to the
driver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and gave loose to
dreams of ambition.</p>

<p id="id01111">Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel, ordered horses to be
ready in two hours, and asked to have his breakfast brought to him. He
was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and
loud. The valet opened the door, and Villefort heard some one speak his
name.</p>

<p id="id01112">"Who could know that I was here already?" said the young man. The valet
entered.</p>

<p id="id01113">"Well," said Villefort, "what is it?&#8212;Who rang?&#8212;Who asked for me?"</p>

<p id="id01114">"A stranger who will not send in his name."</p>

<p id="id01115">"A stranger who will not send in his name! What can he want with me?"</p>

<p id="id01116">"He wishes to speak to you."</p>

<p id="id01117">"To me?"</p>

<p id="id01118">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01119">"Did he mention my name?"</p>

<p id="id01120">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01121">"What sort of person is he?"</p>

<p id="id01122">"Why, sir, a man of about fifty."</p>

<p id="id01123">"Short or tall?"</p>

<p id="id01124">"About your own height, sir."</p>

<p id="id01125">"Dark or fair?"</p>

<p id="id01126">"Dark,&#8212;very dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows."</p>

<p id="id01127">"And how dressed?" asked Villefort quickly.</p>

<p id="id01128">"In a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the Legion of<br/>

Honor."<br/></p>

<p id="id01129">"It is he!" said Villefort, turning pale.</p>

<p id="id01130">"Eh, pardieu," said the individual whose description we have twice
given, entering the door, "what a great deal of ceremony! Is it the
custom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their
anterooms?"</p>

<p id="id01131">"Father!" cried Villefort, "then I was not deceived; I felt sure it must
be you."</p>

<p id="id01132">"Well, then, if you felt so sure," replied the new-comer, putting his
cane in a corner and his hat on a chair, "allow me to say, my dear
Gerard, that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the
door."</p>

<p id="id01133">"Leave us, Germain," said Villefort. The servant quitted the apartment
with evident signs of astonishment.</p>

<h2 id="id01134" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 12. Father and Son.</h2>

<p id="id01135">M. Noirtier&#8212;for it was, indeed, he who entered&#8212;looked after the
servant until the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he
might be overheard in the ante-chamber, he opened the door again,
nor was the precaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of
Germain, who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our
first parents. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the
ante-chamber door, then that of the bed-chamber, and then extended his
hand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which
he could not conceal.</p>

<p id="id01136">"Well, now, my dear Gerard," said he to the young man, with a very
significant look, "do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad to
see me?"</p>

<p id="id01137">"My dear father," said Villefort, "I am, on the contrary, delighted; but<br/>

I so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me."<br/></p>

<p id="id01138">"But, my dear fellow," replied M. Noirtier, seating himself, "I might
say the same thing to you, when you announce to me your wedding for the
28th of February, and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris."</p>

<p id="id01139">"And if I have come, my dear father," said Gerard, drawing closer to
M. Noirtier, "do not complain, for it is for you that I came, and my
journey will be your salvation."</p>

<p id="id01140">"Ah, indeed!" said M. Noirtier, stretching himself out at his ease
in the chair. "Really, pray tell me all about it, for it must be
interesting."</p>

<p id="id01141">"Father, you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue<br/>

Saint-Jacques?"<br/></p>

<p id="id01142">"No. 53; yes, I am vice-president."</p>

<p id="id01143">"Father, your coolness makes me shudder."</p>

<p id="id01144">"Why, my dear boy, when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers,
has escaped from Paris in a hay-cart, been hunted over the plains of
Bordeaux by Robespierre's bloodhounds, he becomes accustomed to most
things. But go on, what about the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques?"</p>

<p id="id01145">"Why, they induced General Quesnel to go there, and General Quesnel, who
quitted his own house at nine o'clock in the evening, was found the next
day in the Seine."</p>

<p id="id01146">"And who told you this fine story?"</p>

<p id="id01147">"The king himself."</p>

<p id="id01148">"Well, then, in return for your story," continued Noirtier, "I will tell
you another."</p>

<p id="id01149">"My dear father, I think I already know what you are about to tell me."</p>

<p id="id01150">"Ah, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?"</p>

<p id="id01151">"Not so loud, father, I entreat of you&#8212;for your own sake as well as
mine. Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for
three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible
speed, half-desperate at the enforced delay."</p>

<p id="id01152">"Three days ago? You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had not
landed."</p>

<p id="id01153">"No matter, I was aware of his intention."</p>

<p id="id01154">"How did you know about it?"</p>

<p id="id01155">"By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba."</p>

<p id="id01156">"To me?"</p>

<p id="id01157">"To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger. Had
that letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father, would
probably ere this have been shot." Villefort's father laughed.</p>

<p id="id01158">"Come, come," said he, "will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so
promptly? Shot, my dear boy? What an idea! Where is the letter you speak
of? I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass
you."</p>

<p id="id01159">"I burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that
letter must have led to your condemnation."</p>

<p id="id01160">"And the destruction of your future prospects," replied Noirtier; "yes,
I can easily comprehend that. But I have nothing to fear while I have
you to protect me."</p>

<p id="id01161">"I do better than that, sir&#8212;I save you."</p>

<p id="id01162">"You do? Why, really, the thing becomes more and more dramatic&#8212;explain
yourself."</p>

<p id="id01163">"I must refer again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques."</p>

<p id="id01164">"It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police. Why didn't
they search more vigilantly? they would have found"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01165">"They have not found; but they are on the track."</p>

<p id="id01166">"Yes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the
police is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the
government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a
sneaking air, that the track is lost."</p>

<p id="id01167">"Yes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and in
all countries they call that a murder."</p>

<p id="id01168">"A murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the
general was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having
thrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to
swim."</p>

<p id="id01169">"Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown
himself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of
January. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense of
the word."</p>

<p id="id01170">"And who thus designated it?"</p>

<p id="id01171">"The king himself."</p>

<p id="id01172">"The king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was
no murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well
as I do, there are no men, but ideas&#8212;no feelings, but interests; in
politics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all.
Would you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell
you. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was
recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and
invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends.
He came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the
projected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the
fullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at
each other,&#8212;he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an
ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear him, and yet,
in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free&#8212;perfectly
free. Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear
fellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, that's all. A murder?
really, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found
an accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you were
fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of one of
my party, 'My son, you have committed a murder?' No, I said, 'Very well,
sir, you have gained the victory; to-morrow, perchance, it will be our
turn.'"</p>

<p id="id01173">"But, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be
sweeping."</p>

<p id="id01174">"I do not understand you."</p>

<p id="id01175">"You rely on the usurper's return?"</p>

<p id="id01176">"We do."</p>

<p id="id01177">"You are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of<br/>

France without being followed, tracked, and caught like a wild beast."<br/></p>

<p id="id01178">"My dear fellow, the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble;
on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons, and on the 20th or 25th at
Paris."</p>

<p id="id01179">"The people will rise."</p>

<p id="id01180">"Yes, to go and meet him."</p>

<p id="id01181">"He has but a handful of men with him, and armies will be despatched
against him."</p>

<p id="id01182">"Yes, to escort him into the capital. Really, my dear Gerard, you are
but a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph
has told you, three days after the landing, 'The usurper has landed at
Cannes with several men. He is pursued.' But where is he? what is he
doing? You do not know at all, and in this way they will chase him to
Paris, without drawing a trigger."</p>

<p id="id01183">"Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities, and will oppose to him an
impassable barrier."</p>

<p id="id01184">"Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm&#8212;all Lyons will
hasten to welcome him. Believe me, we are as well informed as you, and
our police are as good as your own. Would you like a proof of it? well,
you wished to conceal your journey from me, and yet I knew of your
arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier. You gave your
direction to no one but your postilion, yet I have your address, and in
proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table. Ring,
then, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will
dine together."</p>

<p id="id01185">"Indeed!" replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment,
"you really do seem very well informed."</p>

<p id="id01186">"Eh? the thing is simple enough. You who are in power have only the
means that money produces&#8212;we who are in expectation, have those which
devotion prompts."</p>

<p id="id01187">"Devotion!" said Villefort, with a sneer.</p>

<p id="id01188">"Yes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful
ambition."</p>

<p id="id01189">And Villefort's father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon the
servant whom his son had not called. Villefort caught his arm.</p>

<p id="id01190">"Wait, my dear father," said the young man, "one word more."</p>

<p id="id01191">"Say on."</p>

<p id="id01192">"However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible
thing."</p>

<p id="id01193">"What is that?"</p>

<p id="id01194">"The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General<br/>

Quesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house."<br/></p>

<p id="id01195">"Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they? And what may
be that description?"</p>

<p id="id01196">"Dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers, black; blue frock-coat,
buttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor in
his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane."</p>

<p id="id01197">"Ah, ha, that's it, is it?" said Noirtier; "and why, then, have they not
laid hands on him?"</p>

<p id="id01198">"Because yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the
corner of the Rue Coq-Heron."</p>

<p id="id01199">"Didn't I say that your police were good for nothing?"</p>

<p id="id01200">"Yes; but they may catch him yet."</p>

<p id="id01201">"True," said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, "true, if this
person were not on his guard, as he is;" and he added with a smile, "He
will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance." At
these words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and cravat, went towards
a table on which lay his son's toilet articles, lathered his face,
took a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the compromising whiskers.
Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.</p>

<p id="id01202">His whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,
instead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top
of an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned
frock-coat, a coat of Villefort's of dark brown, and cut away in front;
tried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son's, which
appeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner where
he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the air with
it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger which was one
of his principal characteristics.</p>

<p id="id01203">"Well," he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise
was completed, "well, do you think your police will recognize me now."</p>

<p id="id01204">"No, father," stammered Villefort; "at least, I hope not."</p>

<p id="id01205">"And now, my dear boy," continued Noirtier, "I rely on your prudence to
remove all the things which I leave in your care."</p>

<p id="id01206">"Oh, rely on me," said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id01207">"Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really
saved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter." Villefort
shook his head.</p>

<p id="id01208">"You are not convinced yet?"</p>

<p id="id01209">"I hope at least, that you may be mistaken."</p>

<p id="id01210">"Shall you see the king again?"</p>

<p id="id01211">"Perhaps."</p>

<p id="id01212">"Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?"</p>

<p id="id01213">"Prophets of evil are not in favor at the court, father."</p>

<p id="id01214">"True, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second
restoration, you would then pass for a great man."</p>

<p id="id01215">"Well, what should I say to the king?"</p>

<p id="id01216">"Say this to him: 'Sire, you are deceived as to the feeling in France,
as to the opinions of the towns, and the prejudices of the army; he
whom in Paris you call the Corsican ogre, who at Nevers is styled
the usurper, is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons, and emperor at
Grenoble. You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing
as rapidly as his own eagles. The soldiers you believe to be dying with
hunger, worn out with fatigue, ready to desert, gather like atoms of
snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward. Sire, go, leave France
to its real master, to him who acquired it, not by purchase, but by
right of conquest; go, sire, not that you incur any risk, for your
adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy, but because it would be
humiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of
Arcola, Marengo, Austerlitz.' Tell him this, Gerard; or, rather, tell
him nothing. Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you
have come to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter
Marseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain,
quiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time, I
swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies. Go,
my son&#8212;go, my dear Gerard, and by your obedience to my paternal orders,
or, if you prefer it, friendly counsels, we will keep you in your place.
This will be," added Noirtier, with a smile, "one means by which you
may a second time save me, if the political balance should some day take
another turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down. Adieu, my dear
Gerard, and at your next journey alight at my door." Noirtier left the
room when he had finished, with the same calmness that had characterized
him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation.
Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window, put aside the curtain,
and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or three ill-looking men at
the corner of the street, who were there, perhaps, to arrest a man with
black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat, and hat with broad brim.</p>

<p id="id01217">Villefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared
at the Rue Bussy. Then he turned to the various articles he had left
behind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of
the portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into
small bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and
calling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was
ready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready,
learned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the
midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached
Marseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart
of man with ambition and its first successes.</p>

<h2 id="id01218" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 13. The Hundred Days.</h2>

<p id="id01219">M. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he had
predicted. Every one knows the history of the famous return from Elba,
a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably remain
without a counterpart in the future.</p>

<p id="id01220">Louis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;
the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious
foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure
of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,
therefore, gained nothing save the king's gratitude (which was rather
likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of
Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had
duly forwarded the brevet.</p>

<p id="id01221">Napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had
it not been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the
Girondin of '93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately
had been his protector. All Villefort's influence barely enabled him to
stifle the secret Dantes had so nearly divulged. The king's procureur
alone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.</p>

<p id="id01222">However, scarcely was the imperial power established&#8212;that is, scarcely
had the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from
the closet into which we have introduced our readers,&#8212;he found on the
table there Louis XVIII.'s half-filled snuff-box,&#8212;scarcely had this
occurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to rekindle
the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and it
required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater
violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the
royalists whenever they ventured abroad.</p>

<p id="id01223">Owing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment&#8212;we
will not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather
a timid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of
Bonaparte accused him of "moderation"&#8212;but sufficiently influential to
make a demand in favor of Dantes.</p>

<p id="id01224">Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more
favorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gerard
required a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.
returned, the influence of M. de Saint-Meran, like his own, could
be vastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The
deputy-procureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles,
when one morning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.</p>

<p id="id01225">Any one else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man
of ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made Morrel
wait in the ante-chamber, although he had no one with him, for the
simple reason that the king's procureur always makes every one wait, and
after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he ordered M.
Morrel to be admitted.</p>

<p id="id01226">Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had
found him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial
politeness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the
well-bred from the vulgar man.</p>

<p id="id01227">He had entered Villefort's office expecting that the magistrate would
tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder all
over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk,
and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door; Villefort
gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him; then,
after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned his hat
in his hands,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01228">"M. Morrel, I believe?" said Villefort.</p>

<p id="id01229">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p id="id01230">"Come nearer," said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the hand,
"and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit."</p>

<p id="id01231">"Do you not guess, monsieur?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id01232">"Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be
delighted."</p>

<p id="id01233">"Everything depends on you."</p>

<p id="id01234">"Explain yourself, pray."</p>

<p id="id01235">"Monsieur," said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he proceeded, "do
you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the
emperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of my ship, who
was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of
Elba? What was the other day a crime is to-day a title to favor. You
then served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favor&#8212;it was your
duty; to-day you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect him&#8212;it is
equally your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?"</p>

<p id="id01236">Villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself. "What is his
name?" said he. "Tell me his name."</p>

<p id="id01237">"Edmond Dantes."</p>

<p id="id01238">Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a
pistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but he
did not blanch.</p>

<p id="id01239">"Dantes," repeated he, "Edmond Dantes."</p>

<p id="id01240">"Yes, monsieur." Villefort opened a large register, then went to a
table, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to
Morrel,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01241">"Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?" said he, in the
most natural tone in the world.</p>

<p id="id01242">Had Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these
matters, he would have been surprised at the king's procureur answering
him on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors of the
prison or the prefect of the department. But Morrel, disappointed in
his expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other's
condescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.</p>

<p id="id01243">"No," said Morrel; "I am not mistaken. I have known him for ten years,
the last four of which he was in my service. Do not you recollect, I
came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come to-day to
plead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists were
very severe with the Bonapartists in those days."</p>

<p id="id01244">"Monsieur," returned Villefort, "I was then a royalist, because I
believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen
of the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the
legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people."</p>

<p id="id01245">"That's right!" cried Morrel. "I like to hear you speak thus, and I
augur well for Edmond from it."</p>

<p id="id01246">"Wait a moment," said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register;
"I have it&#8212;a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I
recollect now; it was a very serious charge."</p>

<p id="id01247">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id01248">"You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice."</p>

<p id="id01249">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id01250">"I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was
carried off."</p>

<p id="id01251">"Carried off!" said Morrel. "What can they have done with him?"</p>

<p id="id01252">"Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the
Sainte-Marguerite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take
command of your vessel."</p>

<p id="id01253">"Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is not
already returned? It seems to me the first care of government should be
to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it."</p>

<p id="id01254">"Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel," replied Villefort. "The order of
imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation
must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been
reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded."</p>

<p id="id01255">"But," said Morrel, "is there no way of expediting all these
formalities&#8212;of releasing him from arrest?"</p>

<p id="id01256">"There has been no arrest."</p>

<p id="id01257">"How?"</p>

<p id="id01258">"It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man's disappearance
without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may
defeat their wishes."</p>

<p id="id01259">"It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01260">"It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.
The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis himself,
and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is
incalculable." Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness would
have dispelled them.</p>

<p id="id01261">"Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?" asked he.</p>

<p id="id01262">"Petition the minister."</p>

<p id="id01263">"Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions
every day, and does not read three."</p>

<p id="id01264">"That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented
by me."</p>

<p id="id01265">"And will you undertake to deliver it?"</p>

<p id="id01266">"With the greatest pleasure. Dantes was then guilty, and now he is
innocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn
him." Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,
however improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him
defenceless.</p>

<p id="id01267">"But how shall I address the minister?"</p>

<p id="id01268">"Sit down there," said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, "and
write what I dictate."</p>

<p id="id01269">"Will you be so good?"</p>

<p id="id01270">"Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already."</p>

<p id="id01271">"That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be
suffering." Villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone
too far to draw back. Dantes must be crushed to gratify Villefort's
ambition.</p>

<p id="id01272">Villefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention, no
doubt, Dantes' patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made out
one of the most active agents of Napoleon's return. It was evident that
at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him.
The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.</p>

<p id="id01273">"That will do," said he; "leave the rest to me."</p>

<p id="id01274">"Will the petition go soon?"</p>

<p id="id01275">"To-day."</p>

<p id="id01276">"Countersigned by you?"</p>

<p id="id01277">"The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents
of your petition." And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate at
the bottom.</p>

<p id="id01278">"What more is to be done?"</p>

<p id="id01279">"I will do whatever is necessary." This assurance delighted Morrel, who
took leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantes that he
would soon see his son.</p>

<p id="id01280">As for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved
the petition that so fearfully compromised Dantes, in the hopes of an
event that seemed not unlikely,&#8212;that is, a second restoration. Dantes
remained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis
XVIII.'s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.</p>

<p id="id01281">Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice
had Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,
and Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any
fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.</p>

<p id="id01282">Louis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles
had become filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the
situation of king's procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards
he married Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran, whose father now stood higher at
court than ever.</p>

<p id="id01283">And so Dantes, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in
his dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven. Danglars comprehended the
full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dantes; and, when
Napoleon returned to France, he, after the manner of mediocre minds,
termed the coincidence, "a decree of Providence." But when Napoleon
returned to Paris, Danglars' heart failed him, and he lived in constant
fear of Dantes' return on a mission of vengeance. He therefore informed
M. Morrel of his wish to quit the sea, and obtained a recommendation
from him to a Spanish merchant, into whose service he entered at the end
of March, that is, ten or twelve days after Napoleon's return. He then
left for Madrid, and was no more heard of.</p>

<p id="id01284">Fernand understood nothing except that Dantes was absent. What had
become of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the
absence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of
deceiving Mercedes as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of
emigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and motionless
on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence Marseilles and
the Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of a young and
handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of vengeance. Fernand's
mind was made up; he would shoot Dantes, and then kill himself. But
Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself, for
he constantly hopes.</p>

<p id="id01285">During this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man
in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the
emperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible
thought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry
Mercedes. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have done
so when he parted from Mercedes. His devotion, and the compassion he
showed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce on
noble minds&#8212;Mercedes had always had a sincere regard for Fernand, and
this was now strengthened by gratitude.</p>

<p id="id01286">"My brother," said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders,
"be careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall be alone in the
world." These words carried a ray of hope into Fernand's heart. Should
Dantes not return, Mercedes might one day be his.</p>

<p id="id01287">Mercedes was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never
seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in
tears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute
and motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times
gazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast
herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was
not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into
execution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.
Caderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married
and eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dantes,
who was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon's downfall.
Five months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the
hour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercedes' arms. M. Morrel
paid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old man
had contracted.</p>

<p id="id01288">There was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the
south was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of so
dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantes, was stigmatized as a crime.</p>

<h2 id="id01289" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 14. The Two Prisoners.</h2>

<p id="id01290">A year after Louis XVIII.'s restoration, a visit was made by the
inspector-general of prisons. Dantes in his cell heard the noise of
preparation,&#8212;sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been
inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash of
the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon. He
guessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had so
long ceased to have any intercourse with the world, that he looked upon
himself as dead.</p>

<p id="id01291">The inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of
several of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended
them to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed,
and if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that
the fare was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.</p>

<p id="id01292">The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook
their heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector
turned smilingly to the governor.</p>

<p id="id01293">"I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless
visits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,&#8212;always the same
thing,&#8212;ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?"</p>

<p id="id01294">"Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons."</p>

<p id="id01295">"Let us visit them," said the inspector with an air of fatigue. "We must
play the farce to the end. Let us see the dungeons."</p>

<p id="id01296">"Let us first send for two soldiers," said the governor. "The prisoners
sometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in order to be sentenced
to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you might fall a victim."</p>

<p id="id01297">"Take all needful precautions," replied the inspector.</p>

<p id="id01298">Two soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended
a stairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight,
smell, and respiration.</p>

<p id="id01299">"Oh," cried the inspector, "who can live here?"</p>

<p id="id01300">"A most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most
strict watch over, as he is daring and resolute."</p>

<p id="id01301">"He is alone?"</p>

<p id="id01302">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id01303">"How long has he been there?"</p>

<p id="id01304">"Nearly a year."</p>

<p id="id01305">"Was he placed here when he first arrived?"</p>

<p id="id01306">"No; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food to
him."</p>

<p id="id01307">"To kill the turnkey?"</p>

<p id="id01308">"Yes, the very one who is lighting us. Is it not true, Antoine?" asked
the governor.</p>

<p id="id01309">"True enough; he wanted to kill me!" returned the turnkey.</p>

<p id="id01310">"He must be mad," said the inspector.</p>

<p id="id01311">"He is worse than that,&#8212;he is a devil!" returned the turnkey.</p>

<p id="id01312">"Shall I complain of him?" demanded the inspector.</p>

<p id="id01313">"Oh, no; it is useless. Besides, he is almost mad now, and in another
year he will be quite so."</p>

<p id="id01314">"So much the better for him,&#8212;he will suffer less," said the inspector.
He was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy, and in every
way fit for his office.</p>

<p id="id01315">"You are right, sir," replied the governor; "and this remark proves that
you have deeply considered the subject. Now we have in a dungeon about
twenty feet distant, and to which you descend by another stair, an abbe,
formerly leader of a party in Italy, who has been here since 1811, and
in 1813 he went mad, and the change is astonishing. He used to weep, he
now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat. You had better see him, for
his madness is amusing."</p>

<p id="id01316">"I will see them both," returned the inspector; "I must conscientiously
perform my duty." This was the inspector's first visit; he wished to
display his authority.</p>

<p id="id01317">"Let us visit this one first," added he.</p>

<p id="id01318">"By all means," replied the governor, and he signed to the turnkey to
open the door. At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and the
creaking of the hinges, Dantes, who was crouched in a corner of the
dungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow
iron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted by two
turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to whom
the governor spoke bareheaded, Dantes, who guessed the truth, and that
the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come,
sprang forward with clasped hands.</p>

<p id="id01319">The soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was
about to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three
steps. Dantes saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing
all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the
inspector, and sought to inspire him with pity.</p>

<p id="id01320">The inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor,
observed, "He will become religious&#8212;he is already more gentle; he is
afraid, and retreated before the bayonets&#8212;madmen are not afraid of
anything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton." Then,
turning to the prisoner, "What is it you want?" said he.</p>

<p id="id01321">"I want to know what crime I have committed&#8212;to be tried; and if I am
guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty."</p>

<p id="id01322">"Are you well fed?" said the inspector.</p>

<p id="id01323">"I believe so; I don't know; it's of no consequence. What matters
really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is that
an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an infamous
denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners."</p>

<p id="id01324">"You are very humble to-day," remarked the governor; "you are not
so always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the
turnkey."</p>

<p id="id01325">"It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he his always been very good
to me, but I was mad."</p>

<p id="id01326">"And you are not so any longer?"</p>

<p id="id01327">"No; captivity has subdued me&#8212;I have been here so long."</p>

<p id="id01328">"So long?&#8212;when were you arrested, then?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p id="id01329">"The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon."</p>

<p id="id01330">"To-day is the 30th of July, 1816,&#8212;why it is but seventeen months."</p>

<p id="id01331">"Only seventeen months," replied Dantes. "Oh, you do not know what is
seventeen months in prison!&#8212;seventeen ages rather, especially to a man
who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition&#8212;to a man, who,
like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an
honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant&#8212;who
sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his
affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living! Seventeen
months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a
worse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me,
then, and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a
verdict&#8212;a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be
denied to one who is accused!"</p>

<p id="id01332">"We shall see," said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, "On
my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against
him."</p>

<p id="id01333">"Certainly; but you will find terrible charges."</p>

<p id="id01334">"Monsieur," continued Dantes, "I know it is not in your power to release<br/>

me; but you can plead for me&#8212;you can have me tried&#8212;and that is all<br/>

I ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was condemned.<br/>

Uncertainty is worse than all."<br/></p>

<p id="id01335">"Go on with the lights," said the inspector.</p>

<p id="id01336">"Monsieur," cried Dantes, "I can tell by your voice you are touched with
pity; tell me at least to hope."</p>

<p id="id01337">"I cannot tell you that," replied the inspector; "I can only promise to
examine into your case."</p>

<p id="id01338">"Oh, I am free&#8212;then I am saved!"</p>

<p id="id01339">"Who arrested you?"</p>

<p id="id01340">"M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says."</p>

<p id="id01341">"M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse."</p>

<p id="id01342">"I am no longer surprised at my detention," murmured Dantes, "since my
only protector is removed."</p>

<p id="id01343">"Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?"</p>

<p id="id01344">"None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me."</p>

<p id="id01345">"I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?"</p>

<p id="id01346">"Entirely."</p>

<p id="id01347">"That is well; wait patiently, then." Dantes fell on his knees, and
prayed earnestly. The door closed; but this time a fresh inmate was left
with Dantes&#8212;hope.</p>

<p id="id01348">"Will you see the register at once," asked the governor, "or proceed to
the other cell?"</p>

<p id="id01349">"Let us visit them all," said the inspector. "If I once went up those
stairs. I should never have the courage to come down again."</p>

<p id="id01350">"Ah, this one is not like the other, and his madness is less affecting
than this one's display of reason."</p>

<p id="id01351">"What is his folly?"</p>

<p id="id01352">"He fancies he possesses an immense treasure. The first year he offered
government a million of francs for his release; the second, two; the
third, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of
captivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five
millions."</p>

<p id="id01353">"How curious!&#8212;what is his name?"</p>

<p id="id01354">"The Abbe Faria."</p>

<p id="id01355">"No. 27," said the inspector.</p>

<p id="id01356">"It is here; unlock the door, Antoine." The turnkey obeyed, and the
inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the "mad abbe."</p>

<p id="id01357">In the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster
detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely
covered him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines, and seemed
as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of
Marcellus slew him.</p>

<p id="id01358">He did not move at the sound of the door, and continued his calculations
until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the
sombre walls of his cell; then, raising his head, he perceived with
astonishment the number of persons present. He hastily seized the
coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it round him.</p>

<p id="id01359">"What is it you want?" said the inspector.</p>

<p id="id01360">"I, monsieur," replied the abbe with an air of surprise&#8212;"I want
nothing."</p>

<p id="id01361">"You do not understand," continued the inspector; "I am sent here by
government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the prisoners."</p>

<p id="id01362">"Oh, that is different," cried the abbe; "and we shall understand each
other, I hope."</p>

<p id="id01363">"There, now," whispered the governor, "it is just as I told you."</p>

<p id="id01364">"Monsieur," continued the prisoner, "I am the Abbe Faria, born at Rome.<br/>

I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada's secretary; I was arrested, why,<br/>

I know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have<br/>

demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government."<br/></p>

<p id="id01365">"Why from the French government?"</p>

<p id="id01366">"Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and<br/>

Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department."<br/></p>

<p id="id01367">"Ah," said the inspector, "you have not the latest news from Italy?"</p>

<p id="id01368">"My information dates from the day on which I was arrested," returned
the Abbe Faria; "and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for
his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli
and Caesar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom."</p>

<p id="id01369">"Monsieur," returned the inspector, "providence has changed this
gigantic plan you advocate so warmly."</p>

<p id="id01370">"It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and
independent."</p>

<p id="id01371">"Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire
if you have anything to ask or to complain of."</p>

<p id="id01372">"The food is the same as in other prisons,&#8212;that is, very bad; the
lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon;
but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to
reveal of the greatest importance."</p>

<p id="id01373">"We are coming to the point," whispered the governor.</p>

<p id="id01374">"It is for that reason I am delighted to see you," continued the abbe,
"although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which,
if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton's system. Could you allow
me a few words in private."</p>

<p id="id01375">"What did I tell you?" said the governor.</p>

<p id="id01376">"You knew him," returned the inspector with a smile.</p>

<p id="id01377">"What you ask is impossible, monsieur," continued he, addressing Faria.</p>

<p id="id01378">"But," said the abbe, "I would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to
five millions."</p>

<p id="id01379">"The very sum you named," whispered the inspector in his turn.</p>

<p id="id01380">"However," continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was about to
depart, "it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone; the governor
can be present."</p>

<p id="id01381">"Unfortunately," said the governor, "I know beforehand what you are
about to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?" Faria fixed his
eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced any one else of
his sanity.</p>

<p id="id01382">"Of course," said he; "of what else should I speak?"</p>

<p id="id01383">"Mr. Inspector," continued the governor, "I can tell you the story as
well as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five
years."</p>

<p id="id01384">"That proves," returned the abbe, "that you are like those of Holy Writ,
who having ears hear not, and having eyes see not."</p>

<p id="id01385">"My dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures,"
replied the inspector; "keep them until you are liberated." The abbe's
eyes glistened; he seized the inspector's hand.</p>

<p id="id01386">"But what if I am not liberated," cried he, "and am detained here until
my death? this treasure will be lost. Had not government better profit
by it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the
rest, if they will only give me my liberty."</p>

<p id="id01387">"On my word," said the inspector in a low tone, "had I not been told
beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says."</p>
