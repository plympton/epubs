<p id="id09659">"Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars? Undeceive yourself
again; either I am greatly mistaken, or she has provided against the
catastrophe which threatens you, and, which will pass over without
affecting her. She has taken care for herself,&#8212;at least I hope so,&#8212;for
her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over
me. She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love
for liberty. Oh, no, sir; from my childhood I have seen too much, and
understood too much, of what has passed around me, for misfortune to
have an undue power over me. From my earliest recollections, I have been
beloved by no one&#8212;so much the worse; that has naturally led me to love
no one&#8212;so much the better&#8212;now you have my profession of faith."</p>

<p id="id09660">"Then," said Danglars, pale with anger, which was not at all due to
offended paternal love,&#8212;"then, mademoiselle, you persist in your
determination to accelerate my ruin?"</p>

<p id="id09661">"Your ruin? I accelerate your ruin? What do you mean? I do not
understand you."</p>

<p id="id09662">"So much the better, I have a ray of hope left; listen."</p>

<p id="id09663">"I am all attention," said Eugenie, looking so earnestly at her father
that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze.</p>

<p id="id09664">"M. Cavalcanti," continued Danglars, "is about to marry you, and will
place in my hands his fortune, amounting to three million livres."</p>

<p id="id09665">"That is admirable!" said Eugenie with sovereign contempt, smoothing her
gloves out one upon the other.</p>

<p id="id09666">"You think I shall deprive you of those three millions," said Danglars;
"but do not fear it. They are destined to produce at least ten. I and a
brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway, the only industrial
enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous
prospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians, in
the fantastic Mississippi scheme. As I look at it, a millionth part of a
railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks
of the Ohio. We make in our case a deposit, on a mortgage, which is an
advance, as you see, since we gain at least ten, fifteen, twenty, or a
hundred livres' worth of iron in exchange for our money. Well, within
a week I am to deposit four millions for my share; the four millions, I
promise you, will produce ten or twelve."</p>

<p id="id09667">"But during my visit to you the day before yesterday, sir, which you
appear to recollect so well," replied Eugenie, "I saw you arranging a
deposit&#8212;is not that the term?&#8212;of five millions and a half; you
even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury, and you
were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like
lightning."</p>

<p id="id09668">"Yes, but those five millions and a half are not mine, and are only a
proof of the great confidence placed in me; my title of popular banker
has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions, and the five
millions and a half belong to them; at any other time I should not have
hesitated to make use of them, but the great losses I have recently
sustained are well known, and, as I told you, my credit is rather
shaken. That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn, and if I had
employed it for another purpose, I should bring on me a disgraceful
bankruptcy. I do not despise bankruptcies, believe me, but they must
be those which enrich, not those which ruin. Now, if you marry M.
Cavalcanti, and I get the three millions, or even if it is thought I am
going to get them, my credit will be restored, and my fortune, which
for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have
been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality, will revive. Do you
understand me?"</p>

<p id="id09669">"Perfectly; you pledge me for three millions, do you not?"</p>

<p id="id09670">"The greater the amount, the more flattering it is to you; it gives you
an idea of your value."</p>

<p id="id09671">"Thank you. One word more, sir; do you promise me to make what use
you can of the report of the fortune M. Cavalcanti will bring without
touching the money? This is no act of selfishness, but of delicacy. I am
willing to help rebuild your fortune, but I will not be an accomplice in
the ruin of others."</p>

<p id="id09672">"But since I tell you," cried Danglars, "that with these three
million"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09673">"Do you expect to recover your position, sir, without touching those
three million?"</p>

<p id="id09674">"I hope so, if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit."</p>

<p id="id09675">"Shall you be able to pay M. Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs
you promise for my dowry?"</p>

<p id="id09676">"He shall receive them on returning from the mayor's." [*]</p>

<p id="id09677">     * The performance of the civil marriage.</p>

<p id="id09678">"Very well!"</p>

<p id="id09679">"What next? what more do you want?"</p>

<p id="id09680">"I wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely
free in my person?"</p>

<p id="id09681">"Absolutely."</p>

<p id="id09682">"Then, as I said before, sir,&#8212;very well; I am ready to marry M.<br/>

Cavalcanti."<br/></p>

<p id="id09683">"But what are you up to?"</p>

<p id="id09684">"Ah, that is my affair. What advantage should I have over you, if
knowing your secret I were to tell you mine?" Danglars bit his lips.
"Then," said he, "you are ready to pay the official visits, which are
absolutely indispensable?"</p>

<p id="id09685">"Yes," replied Eugenie.</p>

<p id="id09686">"And to sign the contract in three days?"</p>

<p id="id09687">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09688">"Then, in my turn, I also say, very well!" Danglars pressed his
daughter's hand in his. But, extraordinary to relate, the father did not
say, "Thank you, my child," nor did the daughter smile at her father.
"Is the conference ended?" asked Eugenie, rising. Danglars motioned that
he had nothing more to say. Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded
to the touch of Mademoiselle d'Armilly's fingers, and Mademoiselle
Danglars was singing Brabantio's malediction on Desdemona. At the end of
the piece Etienne entered, and announced to Eugenie that the horses were
in the carriage, and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her
visits. We have seen them at Villefort's; they proceeded then on their
course.</p>

<h2 id="id09689" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 96. The Contract.</h2>

<p id="id09690">Three days after the scene we have just described, namely towards five
o'clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of
the contract between Mademoiselle Eugenie Danglars and Andrea
Cavalcanti,&#8212;whom the banker persisted in calling prince,&#8212;a fresh
breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the
Count of Monte Cristo's house, and the count was preparing to go out.
While his horses were impatiently pawing the ground,&#8212;held in by the
coachman, who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box,&#8212;the
elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of
the entrance-gate, and cast out on the doorsteps M. Andrea Cavalcanti,
as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess. He
inquired after the count with his usual familiarity, and ascending
lightly to the second story met him at the top of the stairs. The count
stopped on seeing the young man. As for Andrea, he was launched, and
when he was once launched nothing stopped him. "Ah, good morning,
my dear count," said he. "Ah, M. Andrea," said the latter, with his
half-jesting tone; "how do you do."</p>

<p id="id09691">"Charmingly, as you see. I am come to talk to you about a thousand
things; but, first tell me, were you going out or just returned?"</p>

<p id="id09692">"I was going out, sir."</p>

<p id="id09693">"Then, in order not to hinder you, I will get up with you if you please
in your carriage, and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow."</p>

<p id="id09694">"No," said the count, with an imperceptible smile of contempt, for
he had no wish to be seen in the young man's society,&#8212;"no; I prefer
listening to you here, my dear M. Andrea; we can chat better in-doors,
and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation." The count
returned to a small drawing-room on the first floor, sat down, and
crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also. Andrea
assumed his gayest manner. "You know, my dear count," said he, "the
ceremony is to take place this evening. At nine o'clock the contract is
to be signed at my father-in-law's."</p>

<p id="id09695">"Ah, indeed?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09696">"What; is it news to you? Has not M. Danglars informed you of the
ceremony?"</p>

<p id="id09697">"Oh, yes," said the count; "I received a letter from him yesterday, but<br/>

I do not think the hour was mentioned."<br/></p>

<p id="id09698">"Possibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety."</p>

<p id="id09699">"Well," said Monte Cristo, "you are fortunate, M. Cavalcanti; it is a
most suitable alliance you are contracting, and Mademoiselle Danglars is
a handsome girl."</p>

<p id="id09700">"Yes, indeed she is," replied Cavalcanti, in a very modest tone.</p>

<p id="id09701">"Above all, she is very rich,&#8212;at least, I believe so," said Monte<br/>

Cristo.<br/></p>

<p id="id09702">"Very rich, do you think?" replied the young man.</p>

<p id="id09703">"Doubtless; it is said M. Danglars conceals at least half of his
fortune."</p>

<p id="id09704">"And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions," said Andrea with a
look sparkling with joy.</p>

<p id="id09705">"Without reckoning," added Monte Cristo, "that he is on the eve of
entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United
States and in England, but quite novel in France."</p>

<p id="id09706">"Yes, yes, I know what you mean,&#8212;the railway, of which he has obtained
the grant, is it not?"</p>

<p id="id09707">"Precisely; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that
affair."</p>

<p id="id09708">"Ten millions! Do you think so? It is magnificent!" said Cavalcanti,
who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words.
"Without reckoning," replied Monte Cristo, "that all his fortune will
come to you, and justly too, since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only
daughter. Besides, your own fortune, as your father assured me, is
almost equal to that of your betrothed. But enough of money matters.
Do you know, M. Andrea, I think you have managed this affair rather
skilfully?"</p>

<p id="id09709">"Not badly, by any means," said the young man; "I was born for a
diplomatist."</p>

<p id="id09710">"Well, you must become a diplomatist; diplomacy, you know, is something
that is not to be acquired; it is instinctive. Have you lost your
heart?"</p>

<p id="id09711">"Indeed, I fear it," replied Andrea, in the tone in which he had heard<br/>

Dorante or Valere reply to Alceste [*] at the Theatre Francais.<br/></p>

<p id="id09712">"Is your love returned?"</p>

<p id="id09713">     * In Moliere's comedy, Le Misanthrope.</p>

<p id="id09714">"I suppose so," said Andrea with a triumphant smile, "since I am
accepted. But I must not forget one grand point."</p>

<p id="id09715">"Which?"</p>

<p id="id09716">"That I have been singularly assisted."</p>

<p id="id09717">"Nonsense."</p>

<p id="id09718">"I have, indeed."</p>

<p id="id09719">"By circumstances?"</p>

<p id="id09720">"No; by you."</p>

<p id="id09721">"By me? Not at all, prince," said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress
on the title, "what have I done for you? Are not your name, your social
position, and your merit sufficient?"</p>

<p id="id09722">"No," said Andrea,&#8212;"no; it is useless for you to say so, count. I
maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name,
my social position, and my merit."</p>

<p id="id09723">"You are completely mistaken, sir," said Monte Cristo coldly, who felt
the perfidious manoeuvre of the young man, and understood the bearing
of his words; "you only acquired my protection after the influence
and fortune of your father had been ascertained; for, after all, who
procured for me, who had never seen either you or your illustrious
father, the pleasure of your acquaintance?&#8212;two of my good friends,
Lord Wilmore and the Abbe Busoni. What encouraged me not to become your
surety, but to patronize you?&#8212;your father's name, so well known in
Italy and so highly honored. Personally, I do not know you." This calm
tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was, for the moment,
restrained by a more muscular hand than his own, and that the restraint
could not be easily broken through.</p>

<p id="id09724">"Oh, then my father has really a very large fortune, count?"</p>

<p id="id09725">"It appears so, sir," replied Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09726">"Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?"</p>

<p id="id09727">"I have been advised of it."</p>

<p id="id09728">"But the three millions?"</p>

<p id="id09729">"The three millions are probably on the road."</p>

<p id="id09730">"Then I shall really have them?"</p>

<p id="id09731">"Oh, well," said the count, "I do not think you have yet known the want
of money." Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a
moment. Then, arousing from his revery,&#8212;"Now, sir, I have one request
to make to you, which you will understand, even if it should be
disagreeable to you."</p>

<p id="id09732">"Proceed," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id09733">"I have formed an acquaintance, thanks to my good fortune, with many
noted persons, and have, at least for the moment, a crowd of friends.
But marrying, as I am about to do, before all Paris, I ought to be
supported by an illustrious name, and in the absence of the paternal
hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar; now, my father is
not coming to Paris, is he? He is old, covered with wounds, and suffers
dreadfully, he says, in travelling."</p>

<p id="id09734">"Indeed?"</p>

<p id="id09735">"Well, I am come to ask a favor of you."</p>

<p id="id09736">"Of me?"</p>

<p id="id09737">"Yes, of you."</p>

<p id="id09738">"And pray what may it be?"</p>

<p id="id09739">"Well, to take his part."</p>

<p id="id09740">"Ah, my dear sir! What?&#8212;after the varied relations I have had the
happiness to sustain towards you, can it be that you know me so little
as to ask such a thing? Ask me to lend you half a million and, although
such a loan is somewhat rare, on my honor, you would annoy me less!
Know, then, what I thought I had already told you, that in participation
in this world's affairs, more especially in their moral aspects, the
Count of Monte Cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and
even the superstitions of the East. I, who have a seraglio at Cairo, one
at Smyrna, and one at Constantinople, preside at a wedding?&#8212;never!"</p>

<p id="id09741">"Then you refuse me?"</p>

<p id="id09742">"Decidedly; and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the
same way."</p>

<p id="id09743">"But what must be done?" said Andrea, disappointed.</p>

<p id="id09744">"You said just now that you had a hundred friends."</p>

<p id="id09745">"Very true, but you introduced me at M. Danglars'."</p>

<p id="id09746">"Not at all! Let us recall the exact facts. You met him at a dinner
party at my house, and you introduced yourself at his house; that is a
totally different affair."</p>

<p id="id09747">"Yes, but, by my marriage, you have forwarded that."</p>

<p id="id09748">"I?&#8212;not in the least, I beg you to believe. Recollect what I told you
when you asked me to propose you. 'Oh, I never make matches, my dear
prince, it is my settled principle.'" Andrea bit his lips.</p>

<p id="id09749">"But, at least, you will be there?"</p>

<p id="id09750">"Will all Paris be there?"</p>

<p id="id09751">"Oh, certainly."</p>

<p id="id09752">"Well, like all Paris, I shall be there too," said the count.</p>

<p id="id09753">"And will you sign the contract?"</p>

<p id="id09754">"I see no objection to that; my scruples do not go thus far."</p>

<p id="id09755">"Well, since you will grant me no more, I must be content with what you
give me. But one word more, count."</p>

<p id="id09756">"What is it?"</p>

<p id="id09757">"Advice."</p>

<p id="id09758">"Be careful; advice is worse than a service."</p>

<p id="id09759">"Oh, you can give me this without compromising yourself."</p>

<p id="id09760">"Tell me what it is."</p>

<p id="id09761">"Is my wife's fortune five hundred thousand livres?"</p>

<p id="id09762">"That is the sum M. Danglars himself announced."</p>

<p id="id09763">"Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?"</p>

<p id="id09764">"This is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished
to do them stylishly: Your two solicitors appoint a meeting, when
the contract is signed, for the next or the following day; then they
exchange the two portions, for which they each give a receipt; then,
when the marriage is celebrated, they place the amount at your disposal
as the chief member of the alliance."</p>

<p id="id09765">"Because," said Andrea, with a certain ill-concealed uneasiness, "I
thought I heard my father-in-law say that he intended embarking our
property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now."</p>

<p id="id09766">"Well," replied Monte Cristo, "it will be the way, everybody says, of
trebling your fortune in twelve months. Baron Danglars is a good father,
and knows how to calculate."</p>

<p id="id09767">"In that case," said Andrea, "everything is all right, excepting your
refusal, which quite grieves me."</p>

<p id="id09768">"You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar
circumstances."</p>

<p id="id09769">"Well," said Andrea, "let it be as you wish. This evening, then, at nine
o'clock."</p>

<p id="id09770">"Adieu till then." Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of
Monte Cristo, whose lips turned pale, but who preserved his ceremonious
smile, Andrea seized the count's hand, pressed it, jumped into his
phaeton, and disappeared.</p>

<p id="id09771">The four or five remaining hours before nine o'clock arrived, Andrea
employed in riding, paying visits,&#8212;designed to induce those of whom
he had spoken to appear at the banker's in their gayest
equipages,&#8212;dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have
since turned every brain, and in which Danglars was just taking the
initiative. In fact, at half-past eight in the evening the grand salon,
the gallery adjoining, and the three other drawing-rooms on the same
floor, were filled with a perfumed crowd, who sympathized but little
in the event, but who all participated in that love of being present
wherever there is anything fresh to be seen. An Academician would say
that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of
flowers which attract inconstant butterflies, famished bees, and buzzing
drones.</p>

<p id="id09772">No one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated; the light
streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings; and all the
bad taste of decorations, which had only their richness to boast of,
shone in its splendor. Mademoiselle Eugenie was dressed with elegant
simplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half
concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied
by a single jewel. Her eyes, however, betrayed that perfect confidence
which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire. Madame
Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray, Beauchamp, and
Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id09773">Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony, but on the
same plane with every one else, and without any particular privilege. M.
Danglars, surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue, was
explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when
the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the
ministry. Andrea, on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies
of the opera, was explaining to him rather cleverly, since he was
obliged to be bold to appear at ease, his future projects, and the new
luxuries he meant to introduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and
seventy-five thousand livres per annum.</p>

<p id="id09774">The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of
turquoises, rubies, emeralds, opals, and diamonds. As usual, the oldest
women were the most decorated, and the ugliest the most conspicuous. If
there was a beautiful lily, or a sweet rose, you had to search for it,
concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban, or an aunt with
a bird of paradise.</p>

<p id="id09775">At each moment, in the midst of the crowd, the buzzing, and the
laughter, the door-keeper's voice was heard announcing some name well
known in the financial department, respected in the army, or illustrious
in the literary world, and which was acknowledged by a slight movement
in the different groups. But for one whose privilege it was to agitate
that ocean of human waves, how many were received with a look of
indifference or a sneer of disdain! At the moment when the hand of the
massive time-piece, representing Endymion asleep, pointed to nine on its
golden face, and the hammer, the faithful type of mechanical thought,
struck nine times, the name of the Count of Monte Cristo resounded in
its turn, and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards
the door.</p>

<p id="id09776">The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his
white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black
stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly
paleness of his face. His only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the
slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat. A
circle was immediately formed around the door. The count perceived at
one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawing-room, M. Danglars
at the other, and Eugenie in front of him. He first advanced towards the
baroness, who was chatting with Madame de Villefort, who had come alone,
Valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so clear
was the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to Eugenie, whom
he complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that the proud artist
was quite struck. Near her was Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly, who
thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given
her for Italy, which she intended immediately to make use of. On leaving
these ladies he found himself with Danglars, who had advanced to meet
him.</p>

<p id="id09777">Having accomplished these three social duties, Monte Cristo stopped,
looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class,
which seems to say, "I have done my duty, now let others do theirs."
Andrea, who was in an adjoining room, had shared in the sensation caused
by the arrival of Monte Cristo, and now came forward to pay his respects
to the count. He found him completely surrounded; all were eager to
speak to him, as is always the case with those whose words are few
and weighty. The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their
scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered
the table prepared for the signature; it was a gilt table supported on
lions' claws. One of the notaries sat down, the other remained standing.
They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract, which half
Paris assembled was to sign. All took their places, or rather the ladies
formed a circle, while the gentlemen (more indifferent to the restraints
of what Boileau calls the "energetic style") commented on the feverish
agitation of Andrea, on M. Danglars' riveted attention, Eugenie's
composure, and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness
treated this important affair.</p>

<p id="id09778">The contract was read during a profound silence. But as soon as it was
finished, the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing-rooms; the
brilliant sums, the rolling millions which were to be at the command
of the two young people, and which crowned the display of the wedding
presents and the young lady's diamonds, which had been made in a room
entirely appropriated for that purpose, had exercised to the full their
delusions over the envious assembly. Mademoiselle Danglars' charms were
heightened in the opinion of the young men, and for the moment seemed
to outvie the sun in splendor. As for the ladies, it is needless to say
that while they coveted the millions, they thought they did not need
them for themselves, as they were beautiful enough without them. Andrea,
surrounded by his friends, complimented, flattered, beginning to believe
in the reality of his dream, was almost bewildered. The notary solemnly
took the pen, flourished it above his head, and said, "Gentlemen, we are
about to sign the contract."</p>

<p id="id09779">The baron was to sign first, then the representative of M. Cavalcanti,
senior, then the baroness, afterwards the "future couple," as they are
styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents. The baron took
the pen and signed, then the representative. The baroness approached,
leaning on Madame de Villefort's arm. "My dear," said she, as she took
the pen, "is it not vexatious? An unexpected incident, in the affair of
murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristo's, in which he nearly fell
a victim, deprives us of the pleasure of seeing M. de Villefort."</p>

<p id="id09780">"Indeed?" said M. Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have
said, "Oh, well, what do I care?"</p>

<p id="id09781">"As a matter of fact," said Monte Cristo, approaching, "I am much afraid
that I am the involuntary cause of his absence."</p>

<p id="id09782">"What, you, count?" said Madame Danglars, signing; "if you are, take
care, for I shall never forgive you." Andrea pricked up his ears.</p>

<p id="id09783">"But it is not my fault, as I shall endeavor to prove." Every one
listened eagerly; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips, was about
to speak. "You remember," said the count, during the most profound
silence, "that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house;
the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice, on attempting
to leave it."</p>

<p id="id09784">"Yes," said Danglars.</p>

<p id="id09785">"In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed, and his
clothes were thrown into a corner, where the police picked them up, with
the exception of the waistcoat, which they overlooked." Andrea turned
pale, and drew towards the door; he saw a cloud rising in the horizon,
which appeared to forebode a coming storm.</p>

<p id="id09786">"Well, this waistcoat was discovered to-day, covered with blood, and
with a hole over the heart." The ladies screamed, and two or three
prepared to faint. "It was brought to me. No one could guess what the
dirty rag could be; I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the
murdered man. My valet, in examining this mournful relic, felt a paper
in the pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you, baron."</p>

<p id="id09787">"To me?" cried Danglars.</p>

<p id="id09788">"Yes, indeed, to you; I succeeded in deciphering your name under the
blood with which the letter was stained," replied Monte Cristo, amid the
general outburst of amazement.</p>

<p id="id09789">"But," asked Madame Danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness,
"how could that prevent M. de Villefort"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09790">"In this simple way, madame," replied Monte Cristo; "the waistcoat and
the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; I therefore
sent them to the king's attorney. You understand, my dear baron, that
legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was, perhaps,
some plot against you." Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and
disappeared in the second drawing-room.</p>

<p id="id09791">"Possibly," said Danglars; "was not this murdered man an old
galley-slave?"</p>

<p id="id09792">"Yes," replied the count; "a felon named Caderousse." Danglars
turned slightly pale; Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little
drawing-room.</p>

<p id="id09793">"But go on signing," said Monte Cristo; "I perceive that my story has
caused a general emotion, and I beg to apologize to you, baroness, and
to Mademoiselle Danglars." The baroness, who had signed, returned
the pen to the notary. "Prince Cavalcanti," said the latter; "Prince
Cavalcanti, where are you?"</p>

<p id="id09794">"Andrea, Andrea," repeated several young people, who were already on
sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name.</p>

<p id="id09795">"Call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign," cried<br/>

Danglars to one of the floorkeepers.<br/></p>

<p id="id09796">But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the
principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments,
quaerens quem devoret. There was, indeed, reason to retreat, to be
alarmed, and to scream. An officer was placing two soldiers at the door
of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards Danglars, preceded by a
commissary of police, girded with his scarf. Madame Danglars uttered a
scream and fainted. Danglars, who thought himself threatened (certain
consciences are never calm),&#8212;Danglars even before his guests showed a
countenance of abject terror.</p>

<p id="id09797">"What is the matter, sir?" asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the
commissioner.</p>

<p id="id09798">"Which of you gentlemen," asked the magistrate, without replying to the
count, "answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti?" A cry of astonishment
was heard from all parts of the room. They searched; they questioned.
"But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti?" asked Danglars in amazement.</p>

<p id="id09799">"A galley-slave, escaped from confinement at Toulon."</p>

<p id="id09800">"And what crime has he committed?"</p>

<p id="id09801">"He is accused," said the commissary with his inflexible voice, "of
having assassinated the man named Caderousse, his former companion in
prison, at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the
Count of Monte Cristo." Monte Cristo cast a rapid glance around him.
Andrea was gone.</p>

<h2 id="id09802" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 97. The Departure for Belgium.</h2>

<p id="id09803">A few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M.
Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and by
the disclosure which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as
much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out
among the guests. In a few minutes, through all the doors, down all the
staircases, by every exit, every one hastened to retire, or rather to
fly; for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences,&#8212;which even
the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes,&#8212;were
seen to be utterly futile. There remained in the banker's house only
Danglars, closeted in his study, and making his statement to the officer
of gendarmes; Madame Danglars, terrified, in the boudoir with which we
are acquainted; and Eugenie, who with haughty air and disdainful lip had
retired to her room with her inseparable companion, Mademoiselle Louise
d'Armilly. As for the numerous servants (more numerous that evening than
usual, for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Cafe
de Paris), venting on their employers their anger at what they termed
the insult to which they had been subjected, they collected in groups
in the hall, in the kitchens, or in their rooms, thinking very little of
their duty, which was thus naturally interrupted. Of all this household,
only two persons deserve our notice; these are Mademoiselle Eugenie
Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly.</p>

<p id="id09804">The betrothed had retired, as we said, with haughty air, disdainful lip,
and the demeanor of an outraged queen, followed by her companion, who
was paler and more disturbed than herself. On reaching her room Eugenie
locked her door, while Louise fell on a chair. "Ah, what a dreadful
thing," said the young musician; "who would have suspected it? M. Andrea
Cavalcanti a murderer&#8212;a galley-slave escaped&#8212;a convict!" An ironical
smile curled the lip of Eugenie. "In truth I was fated," said she. "I
escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id09805">"Oh, do not confound the two, Eugenie."</p>

<p id="id09806">"Hold your tongue! The men are all infamous, and I am happy to be able
now to do more than detest them&#8212;I despise them."</p>

<p id="id09807">"What shall we do?" asked Louise.</p>

<p id="id09808">"What shall we do?"</p>

<p id="id09809">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09810">"Why, the same we had intended doing three days since&#8212;set off."</p>

<p id="id09811">"What?&#8212;although you are not now going to be married, you intend
still"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09812">"Listen, Louise. I hate this life of the fashionable world, always
ordered, measured, ruled, like our music-paper. What I have always
wished for, desired, and coveted, is the life of an artist, free and
independent, relying only on my own resources, and accountable only to
myself. Remain here? What for?&#8212;that they may try, a month hence,
to marry me again; and to whom?&#8212;M. Debray, perhaps, as it was once
proposed. No, Louise, no! This evening's adventure will serve for my
excuse. I did not seek one, I did not ask for one. God sends me this,
and I hail it joyfully!"</p>

<p id="id09813">"How strong and courageous you are!" said the fair, frail girl to her
brunette companion.</p>

<p id="id09814">"Did you not yet know me? Come, Louise, let us talk of our affairs. The
post-chaise"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09815">"Was happily bought three days since."</p>

<p id="id09816">"Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?"</p>

<p id="id09817">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09818">"Our passport?"</p>

<p id="id09819">"Here it is."</p>

<p id="id09820">And Eugenie, with her usual precision, opened a printed paper, and
read,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09821">"M. Leon d'Armilly, twenty years of age; profession, artist; hair black,
eyes black; travelling with his sister."</p>

<p id="id09822">"Capital! How did you get this passport?"</p>

<p id="id09823">"When I went to ask M. de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors of
the theatres at Rome and Naples, I expressed my fears of travelling as
a woman; he perfectly understood them, and undertook to procure for me
a man's passport, and two days after I received this, to which I have
added with my own hand, 'travelling with his sister.'"</p>

<p id="id09824">"Well," said Eugenie cheerfully, "we have then only to pack up our
trunks; we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract,
instead of the evening of the wedding&#8212;that is all."</p>

<p id="id09825">"But consider the matter seriously, Eugenie!"</p>

<p id="id09826">"Oh, I am done with considering! I am tired of hearing only of market
reports, of the end of the month, of the rise and fall of Spanish funds,
of Haitian bonds. Instead of that, Louise&#8212;do you understand?&#8212;air,
liberty, melody of birds, plains of Lombardy, Venetian canals, Roman
palaces, the Bay of Naples. How much have we, Louise?" The young girl to
whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretary a small
portfolio with a lock, in which she counted twenty-three bank-notes.</p>

<p id="id09827">"Twenty-three thousand francs," said she.</p>

<p id="id09828">"And as much, at least, in pearls, diamonds, and jewels," said
Eugenie. "We are rich. With forty-five thousand francs we can live
like princesses for two years, and comfortably for four; but before six
months&#8212;you with your music, and I with my voice&#8212;we shall double our
capital. Come, you shall take charge of the money, I of the jewel-box;
so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure, the other
would still have hers left. Now, the portmanteau&#8212;let us make haste&#8212;the
portmanteau!"</p>

<p id="id09829">"Stop!" said Louise, going to listen at Madame Danglars' door.</p>

<p id="id09830">"What do you fear?"</p>

<p id="id09831">"That we may be discovered."</p>

<p id="id09832">"The door is locked."</p>

<p id="id09833">"They may tell us to open it."</p>

<p id="id09834">"They may if they like, but we will not."</p>

<p id="id09835">"You are a perfect Amazon, Eugenie!" And the two young girls began
to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require.
"There now," said Eugenie, "while I change my costume do you lock the
portmanteau." Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands
on the top of the portmanteau. "But I cannot," said she; "I am not
strong enough; do you shut it."</p>

<p id="id09836">"Ah, you do well to ask," said Eugenie, laughing; "I forgot that I was
Hercules, and you only the pale Omphale!" And the young girl, kneeling
on the top, pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together, and
Mademoiselle d'Armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through. When this
was done, Eugenie opened a drawer, of which she kept the key, and took
from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak. "Here," said she, "you
see I have thought of everything; with this cloak you will not be cold."</p>

<p id="id09837">"But you?"</p>

<p id="id09838">"Oh, I am never cold, you know! Besides, with these men's clothes"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09839">"Will you dress here?"</p>

<p id="id09840">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id09841">"Shall you have time?"</p>

<p id="id09842">"Do not be uneasy, you little coward! All our servants are busy,
discussing the grand affair. Besides, what is there astonishing, when
you think of the grief I ought to be in, that I shut myself up?&#8212;tell
me!"</p>

<p id="id09843">"No, truly&#8212;you comfort me."</p>

<p id="id09844">"Come and help me."</p>

<p id="id09845">From the same drawer she took a man's complete costume, from the
boots to the coat, and a provision of linen, where there was nothing
superfluous, but every requisite. Then, with a promptitude which
indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by
adopting the garb of the opposite sex, Eugenie drew on the boots and
pantaloons, tied her cravat, buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat,
and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure. "Oh, that
is very good&#8212;indeed, it is very good!" said Louise, looking at her with
admiration; "but that beautiful black hair, those magnificent braids,
which made all the ladies sigh with envy,&#8212;will they go under a man's
hat like the one I see down there?"</p>

<p id="id09846">"You shall see," said Eugenie. And with her left hand seizing the thick
mass, which her long fingers could scarcely grasp, she took in her right
hand a pair of long scissors, and soon the steel met through the rich
and splendid hair, which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned
back to keep it from her coat. Then she grasped the front hair, which
she also cut off, without expressing the least regret; on the contrary,
her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony
eyebrows. "Oh, the magnificent hair!" said Louise, with regret.</p>

<p id="id09847">"And am I not a hundred times better thus?" cried Eugenie, smoothing the
scattered curls of her hair, which had now quite a masculine appearance;
"and do you not think me handsomer so?"</p>

<p id="id09848">"Oh, you are beautiful&#8212;always beautiful!" cried Louise. "Now, where are
you going?"</p>

<p id="id09849">"To Brussels, if you like; it is the nearest frontier. We can go to<br/>

Brussels, Liege, Aix-la-Chapelle; then up the Rhine to Strasburg. We<br/>

will cross Switzerland, and go down into Italy by the Saint-Gothard.<br/>

Will that do?"<br/></p>

<p id="id09850">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id09851">"What are you looking at?"</p>

<p id="id09852">"I am looking at you; indeed you are adorable like that! One would say
you were carrying me off."</p>

<p id="id09853">"And they would be right, pardieu!"</p>

<p id="id09854">"Oh, I think you swore, Eugenie." And the two young girls, whom every
one might have thought plunged in grief, the one on her own account, the
other from interest in her friend, burst out laughing, as they cleared
away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied
the preparations for their escape. Then, having blown out the lights,
the two fugitives, looking and listening eagerly, with outstretched
necks, opened the door of a dressing-room which led by a side staircase
down to the yard,&#8212;Eugenie going first, and holding with one arm
the portmanteau, which by the opposite handle Mademoiselle d'Armilly
scarcely raised with both hands. The yard was empty; the clock was
striking twelve. The porter was not yet gone to bed. Eugenie approached
softly, and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an arm-chair in his
lodge. She returned to Louise, took up the portmanteau, which she had
placed for a moment on the ground, and they reached the archway under
the shadow of the wall.</p>

<p id="id09855">Eugenie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway, so that if the
porter chanced to awake he might see but one person. Then placing
herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard,&#8212;"Gate!" cried
she, with her finest contralto voice, and rapping at the window.</p>

<p id="id09856">The porter got up as Eugenie expected, and even advanced some steps to
recognize the person who was going out, but seeing a young man striking
his boot impatiently with his riding-whip, he opened it immediately.
Louise slid through the half-open gate like a snake, and bounded lightly
forward. Eugenie, apparently calm, although in all probability her heart
beat somewhat faster than usual, went out in her turn. A porter was
passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two young girls,
having told him to take it to No. 36, Rue de la Victoire, walked behind
this man, whose presence comforted Louise. As for Eugenie, she was as
strong as a Judith or a Delilah. They arrived at the appointed spot.
Eugenie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau, gave him some
pieces of money, and having rapped at the shutter sent him away. The
shutter where Eugenie had rapped was that of a little laundress, who
had been previously warned, and was not yet gone to bed. She opened the
door.</p>

<p id="id09857">"Mademoiselle," said Eugenie, "let the porter get the post-chaise from
the coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the hotel. Here are
five francs for his trouble."</p>

<p id="id09858">"Indeed," said Louise, "I admire you, and I could almost say respect
you." The laundress looked on in astonishment, but as she had been
promised twenty louis, she made no remark.</p>

<p id="id09859">In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post-boy and horses,
which were harnessed, and put in the post-chaise in a minute, while the
porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and
strap. "Here is the passport," said the postilion, "which way are we
going, young gentleman?"</p>

<p id="id09860">"To Fontainebleau," replied Eugenie with an almost masculine voice.</p>

<p id="id09861">"What do you say?" said Louise.</p>

<p id="id09862">"I am giving them the slip," said Eugenie; "this woman to whom we have
given twenty louis may betray us for forty; we will soon alter our
direction." And the young girl jumped into the britzska, which was
admirably arranged for sleeping in, without scarcely touching the step.
"You are always right," said the music teacher, seating herself by the
side of her friend.</p>

<p id="id09863">A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion, having been put in the
right road, passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the
Barriere Saint-Martin. "Ah," said Louise, breathing freely, "here we are
out of Paris."</p>

<p id="id09864">"Yes, my dear, the abduction is an accomplished fact," replied Eugenie.<br/>

"Yes, and without violence," said Louise.<br/></p>

<p id="id09865">"I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance," replied
Eugenie. These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in
rolling over the pavement of La Villette. M. Danglars no longer had a
daughter.</p>

<h2 id="id09866" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern.</h2>

<p id="id09867">And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their
way to Brussels, and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti, so inopportunely
interrupted in his rise to fortune. Notwithstanding his youth, Master
Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy. We have seen that on
the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the
door, and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared. But we have
forgotten to mention one circumstance, which nevertheless ought not
to be omitted; in one of the rooms he crossed, the trousseau of the
bride-elect was on exhibition. There were caskets of diamonds, cashmere
shawls, Valenciennes lace, English veilings, and in fact all the
tempting things, the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young
girls bound with joy, and which is called the "corbeille." [*] Now, in
passing through this room, Andrea proved himself not only to be clever
and intelligent, but also provident, for he helped himself to the most
valuable of the ornaments before him.</p>

<p id="id09868" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     * Literally, "the basket," because wedding gifts were
     originally brought in such a receptacle.</p>

<p id="id09869">Furnished with this plunder, Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the
window, intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes. Tall and
well proportioned as an ancient gladiator, and muscular as a Spartan,
he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his
steps, actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if
he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken. Having passed through
the Rue Mont Blanc, guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to
take the safest path, he found himself at the end of the Rue Lafayette.
There he stopped, breathless and panting. He was quite alone; on one
side was the vast wilderness of the Saint-Lazare, on the other, Paris
enshrouded in darkness. "Am I to be captured?" he cried; "no, not if I
can use more activity than my enemies. My safety is now a mere question
of speed." At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg
Poissonniere. The dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along
toward the limits of the Faubourg Saint-Denis, where no doubt he
ordinarily had his station. "Ho, friend!" said Benedetto.</p>

<p id="id09870">"What do you want, sir?" asked the driver.</p>

<p id="id09871">"Is your horse tired?"</p>

<p id="id09872">"Tired? oh, yes, tired enough&#8212;he has done nothing the whole of this
blessed day! Four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all
seven francs, are all that I have earned, and I ought to take ten to the
owner."</p>

<p id="id09873">"Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?"</p>

<p id="id09874">"With pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised. Tell me what<br/>

I am to do for this."<br/></p>

<p id="id09875">"A very easy thing, if your horse isn't tired."</p>

<p id="id09876">"I tell you he'll go like the wind,&#8212;only tell me which way to drive."</p>

<p id="id09877">"Towards the Louvres."</p>

<p id="id09878">"Ah, I know the way&#8212;you get good sweetened rum over there."</p>

<p id="id09879">"Exactly so; I merely wish to overtake one of my friends, with whom I am
going to hunt to-morrow at Chapelle-en-Serval. He should have waited for
me here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven; it is twelve, and, tired
of waiting, he must have gone on."</p>

<p id="id09880">"It is likely."</p>

<p id="id09881">"Well, will you try and overtake him?"</p>

<p id="id09882">"Nothing I should like better."</p>

<p id="id09883">"If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have
twenty francs; if not before Louvres, thirty."</p>

<p id="id09884">"And if we do overtake him?"</p>

<p id="id09885">"Forty," said Andrea, after a moment's hesitation, at the end of which
he remembered that he might safely promise. "That's all right," said the
man; "hop in, and we're off! Who-o-o-p, la!"</p>

<p id="id09886">Andrea got into the cab, which passed rapidly through the Faubourg
Saint-Denis, along the Faubourg Saint-Martin, crossed the barrier, and
threaded its way through the interminable Villette. They never overtook
the chimerical friend, yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot
whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green
cabriolet and bay horse; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be
seen on the road to the Low Countries, and as nine-tenths of them are
green, the inquiries increased at every step. Every one had just seen
it pass; it was only five hundred, two hundred, one hundred steps in
advance; at length they reached it, but it was not the friend. Once
the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two
post-horses. "Ah," said Cavalcanti to himself, "if I only had that
britzska, those two good post-horses, and above all the passport
that carries them on!" And he sighed deeply. The calash contained
Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d'Armilly. "Hurry, hurry!" said
Andrea, "we must overtake him soon." And the poor horse resumed the
desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier, and arrived
steaming at Louvres.</p>

<p id="id09887">"Certainly," said Andrea, "I shall not overtake my friend, but I shall
kill your horse, therefore I had better stop. Here are thirty francs; I
will sleep at the Red Horse, and will secure a place in the first coach.
Good-night, friend." And Andrea, after placing six pieces of five francs
each in the man's hand, leaped lightly on to the pathway. The cabman
joyfully pocketed the sum, and turned back on his road to Paris. Andrea
pretended to go towards the Red Horse inn, but after leaning an instant
against the door, and hearing the last sound of the cab, which was
disappearing from view, he went on his road, and with a lusty stride
soon traversed the space of two leagues. Then he rested; he must be near
Chapelle-en-Serval, where he pretended to be going. It was not fatigue
that stayed Andrea here; it was that he might form some resolution,
adopt some plan. It would be impossible to make use of a diligence,
equally so to engage post-horses; to travel either way a passport was
necessary. It was still more impossible to remain in the department of
the Oise, one of the most open and strictly guarded in France; this was
quite out of the question, especially to a man like Andrea, perfectly
conversant with criminal matters.</p>

<p id="id09888">He sat down by the side of the moat, buried his face in his hands and
reflected. Ten minutes after he raised his head; his resolution was
made. He threw some dust over the topcoat, which he had found time to
unhook from the ante-chamber and button over his ball costume, and going
to Chapelle-en-Serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in
the place. The host opened. "My friend," said Andrea, "I was coming from
Montefontaine to Senlis, when my horse, which is a troublesome creature,
stumbled and threw me. I must reach Compiegne to-night, or I shall cause
deep anxiety to my family. Could you let me hire a horse of you?"</p>

<p id="id09889">An inn-keeper has always a horse to let, whether it be good or bad. The
host called the stable-boy, and ordered him to saddle "Whitey," then he
awoke his son, a child of seven years, whom he ordered to ride before
the gentleman and bring back the horse. Andrea gave the inn-keeper
twenty francs, and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting
card. This belonged to one of his friends at the Cafe de Paris, so that
the innkeeper, picking it up after Andrea had left, was convinced that
he had let his horse to the Count of Mauleon, 25 Rue Saint-Dominique,
that being the name and address on the card. "Whitey" was not a fast
animal, but he kept up an easy, steady pace; in three hours and a
half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from
Compiegne, and four o'clock struck as he reached the place where the
coaches stop. There is an excellent tavern at Compiegne, well remembered
by those who have ever been there. Andrea, who had often stayed there
in his rides about Paris, recollected the Bell and Bottle inn; he
turned around, saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp, and having
dismissed the child, giving him all the small coin he had about him, he
began knocking at the door, very reasonably concluding that having now
three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the
fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper. A waiter
opened the door.</p>

<p id="id09890">"My friend," said Andrea, "I have been dining at Saint-Jean-au-Bois, and
expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight, but like a fool
I have lost my way, and have been walking for the last four hours in the
forest. Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the
court, and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux." The waiter
had no suspicions; Andrea spoke with perfect composure, he had a cigar
in his mouth, and his hands in the pocket of his top coat; his clothes
were fashionably made, his chin smooth, his boots irreproachable; he
looked merely as if he had stayed out very late, that was all. While
the waiter was preparing his room, the hostess arose; Andrea assumed
his most charming smile, and asked if he could have No. 3, which he had
occupied on his last stay at Compiegne. Unfortunately, No. 3 was engaged
by a young man who was travelling with his sister. Andrea appeared in
despair, but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that No. 7,
prepared for him, was situated precisely the same as No. 3, and while
warming his feet and chatting about the last races at Chantilly, he
waited until they announced his room to be ready.</p>

<p id="id09891">Andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon
the court of the Bell Tavern, which with its triple galleries like those
of a theatre, with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light
columns, forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you
can imagine. The fowl was tender, the wine old, the fire clear and
sparkling, and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good
an appetite as though nothing had happened. Then he went to bed and
almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men
of twenty years of age, even when they are torn with remorse. Now, here
we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that
he did not. This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the
best chance of his security. Before daybreak he would awake, leave the
inn after rigorously paying his bill, and reaching the forest, he would,
under pretence of making studies in painting, test the hospitality of
some peasants, procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet,
casting off the lion's skin to assume that of the woodman; then, with
his hands covered with dirt, his hair darkened by means of a leaden
comb, his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his
old comrades had given him the recipe, he intended, by following the
wooded districts, to reach the nearest frontier, walking by night and
sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries, and only entering
inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time.</p>

<p id="id09892">Once past the frontier, Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds;
and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about
with him in case of accident, he would then find himself possessor of
about 50,000 livres, which he philosophically considered as no very
deplorable condition after all. Moreover, he reckoned much on
the interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own
misadventures. These were the reasons which, added to the fatigue,
caused Andrea to sleep so soundly. In order that he might awaken early
he did not close the shutters, but contented himself with bolting the
door and placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose
temper he well knew, and which was never absent from him. About seven in
the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight, which played,
warm and brilliant, upon his face. In all well-organized brains, the
predominating idea&#8212;and there always is one&#8212;is sure to be the last
thought before sleeping, and the first upon waking in the morning.
Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea
presented itself, and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long.
He jumped out of bed and ran to the window. A gendarme was crossing the
court. A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world, even
to a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a timid conscience, and
with good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white uniform is really very
alarming.</p>

<p id="id09893">"Why is that gendarme there?" asked Andrea of himself. Then, all at
once, he replied, with that logic which the reader has, doubtless,
remarked in him, "There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at
an inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself." And the youth
dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob
him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris.
"Now then," said Andrea, while dressing himself, "I'll wait till he
leaves, and then I'll slip away." And, saying this, Andrea, who had now
put on his boots and cravat, stole gently to the window, and a second
time lifted up the muslin curtain. Not only was the first gendarme still
there, but the young man now perceived a second yellow, blue, and white
uniform at the foot of the staircase, the only one by which he could
descend, while a third, on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was
posted as a sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the
means of egress.</p>

<p id="id09894">The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd
of curious loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the
entrance to the hotel. "They're after me!" was Andrea's first thought.
"The devil!" A pallor overspread the young man's forehead, and he looked
around him with anxiety. His room, like all those on the same floor, had
but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody. "I am lost!"
was his second thought; and, indeed, for a man in Andrea's situation,
an arrest meant the assizes, trial, and death,&#8212;death without mercy or
delay. For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands,
and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror; but soon
a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered
his mind, and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid
cheeks. He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the
chimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper. With forced composure he
dipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of
paper:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09895">"I have no money to pay my bill, but I am not a dishonest man; I leave
behind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount. I shall be
excused for leaving at daybreak, for I was ashamed."</p>

<p id="id09896">He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper. This
done, instead of leaving the door fastened, he drew back the bolts and
even placed the door ajar, as though he had left the room, forgetting
to close it, and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that
kind of gymnastic exercise, having effaced the marks of his feet upon
the floor, he commenced climbing the only opening which afforded him
the means of escape. At this precise time, the first gendarme Andrea
had noticed walked up-stairs, preceded by the commissary of police,
and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was
himself re-enforced by the one stationed at the door.</p>

<p id="id09897">Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances. At
daybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost
immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost
endeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse. Compiegne, that royal
residence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities,
gendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations
as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the Bell and Bottle
being the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed
their first inquiries there.</p>

<p id="id09898">Now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hotel de Ville,
which is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others
that a number of travellers had arrived during the night. The sentinel
who was relieved at six o'clock in the morning, remembered perfectly
that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young
man arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him. The young man,
having dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel,
which was opened, and again closed after his entrance. This late arrival
had attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other than
Andrea, the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed their
steps towards his room.</p>

<p id="id09899">They found the door ajar. "Oh, ho," said the brigadier, who thoroughly
understood the trick; "a bad sign to find the door open! I would rather
find it triply bolted." And, indeed, the little note and pin upon the
table confirmed, or rather corroborated, the sad truth. Andrea had fled.
We say corroborated, because the brigadier was too experienced to be
convinced by a single proof. He glanced around, looked in the bed, shook
the curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.
Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the
ashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be
passed over without serious investigation.</p>

<p id="id09900">The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw, and having filled the
chimney with them, set a light to it. The fire crackled, and the smoke
ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell
down, as they expected. The fact was, that Andrea, at war with society
ever since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he
were advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the
fire, he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against
the chimney-pots. At one time he thought he was saved, for he heard
the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, "He is not
here!" But venturing to peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of
retiring, as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement,
were watching with increased attention.</p>

<p id="id09901">It was now his turn to look about him; the Hotel de Ville, a massive
sixteenth century building, was on his right; any one could descend from
the openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below,
and Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at
one of these openings. If once discovered, he knew he would be lost, for
the roof afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to descend,
not through the same chimney by which he had come up, but by a similar
one conducting to another room. He looked around for a chimney from
which no smoke issued, and having reached it, he disappeared through the
orifice without being seen by any one. At the same minute, one of the
little windows of the Hotel de Ville was thrown open, and the head of a
gendarme appeared. For an instant it remained motionless as one of
the stone decorations of the building, then after a long sigh of
disappointment the head disappeared. The brigadier, calm and dignified
as the law he represented, passed through the crowd, without answering
the thousand questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.</p>

<p id="id09902">"Well?" asked the two gendarmes.</p>

<p id="id09903">"Well, my boys," said the brigadier, "the brigand must really have
escaped early this morning; but we will send to the Villers-Coterets and
Noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no doubt."
The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that
intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a
loud scream, accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded
through the court of the hotel. "Ah, what is that?" cried the brigadier.</p>

<p id="id09904">"Some traveller seems impatient," said the host. "What number was it
that rang?"</p>

<p id="id09905">"Number 3."</p>

<p id="id09906">"Run, waiter!" At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.
"Ah," said the brigadier, stopping the servant, "the person who is
ringing appears to want something more than a waiter; we will attend
upon him with a gendarme. Who occupies Number 3?"</p>

<p id="id09907">"The little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his
sister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds." The bell here
rang for the third time, with another shriek of anguish.</p>

<p id="id09908">"Follow me, Mr. Commissary!" said the brigadier; "tread in my steps."</p>

<p id="id09909">"Wait an instant," said the host; "Number 3 has two staircases,&#8212;inside
and outside."</p>

<p id="id09910">"Good," said the brigadier. "I will take charge of the inside one. Are
the carbines loaded?"</p>

<p id="id09911">"Yes, brigadier."</p>

<p id="id09912">"Well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon him;
he must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says."</p>

<p id="id09913">The brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside
staircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting
Andrea had excited in the crowd. This is what had happened. Andrea had
very cleverly managed to descend two-thirds of the chimney, but then his
foot slipped, and notwithstanding his endeavors, he came into the room
with more speed and noise than he intended. It would have signified
little had the room been empty, but unfortunately it was occupied. Two
ladies, sleeping in one bed, were awakened by the noise, and fixing
their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded, they saw a man.
One of these ladies, the fair one, uttered those terrible shrieks which
resounded through the house, while the other, rushing to the bell-rope,
rang with all her strength. Andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by
misfortune.</p>

<p id="id09914">"For pity's sake," he cried, pale and bewildered, without seeing whom
he was addressing,&#8212;"for pity's sake do not call assistance! Save me!&#8212;I
will not harm you."</p>

<p id="id09915">"Andrea, the murderer!" cried one of the ladies.</p>

<p id="id09916">"Eugenie! Mademoiselle Danglars!" exclaimed Andrea, stupefied.</p>

<p id="id09917">"Help, help!" cried Mademoiselle d'Armilly, taking the bell from her
companion's hand, and ringing it yet more violently. "Save me, I am
pursued!" said Andrea, clasping his hands. "For pity, for mercy's sake
do not deliver me up!"</p>

<p id="id09918">"It is too late, they are coming," said Eugenie.</p>

<p id="id09919">"Well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed;
you can turn their suspicions and save my life!"</p>

<p id="id09920">The two ladies, pressing closely to one another, and drawing the
bedclothes tightly around them, remained silent to this supplicating
voice, repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds.</p>

<p id="id09921">"Well, be it so," at length said Eugenie; "return by the same road you
came, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch."</p>

<p id="id09922">"Here he is, here he is!" cried a voice from the landing; "here he is!
I see him!" The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole, and had
discovered Andrea in a posture of entreaty. A violent blow from the butt
end of the musket burst open the lock, two more forced out the bolts,
and the broken door fell in. Andrea ran to the other door, leading to
the gallery, ready to rush out; but he was stopped short, and he stood
with his body a little thrown back, pale, and with the useless knife in
his clinched hand.</p>

<p id="id09923">"Fly, then!" cried Mademoiselle d'Armilly, whose pity returned as her
fears diminished; "fly!"</p>

<p id="id09924">"Or kill yourself!" said Eugenie (in a tone which a Vestal in the
amphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to
finish his vanquished adversary). Andrea shuddered, and looked on the
young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such
ferocious honor. "Kill myself?" he cried, throwing down his knife; "why
should I do so?"</p>

<p id="id09925">"Why, you said," answered Mademoiselle Danglars, "that you would be
condemned to die like the worst criminals."</p>

<p id="id09926">"Bah," said Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, "one has friends."</p>

<p id="id09927">The brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand. "Come, come," said Andrea,
"sheathe your sword, my fine fellow; there is no occasion to make such a
fuss, since I give myself up;" and he held out his hands to be manacled.
The girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis, the man
of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley-slave.
Andrea turned towards them, and with an impertinent smile asked,&#8212;"Have
you any message for your father, Mademoiselle Danglars, for in all
probability I shall return to Paris?"</p>

<p id="id09928">Eugenie covered her face with her hands. "Oh, ho!" said Andrea, "you
need not be ashamed, even though you did post after me. Was I not nearly
your husband?"</p>

<p id="id09929">And with this raillery Andrea went out, leaving the two girls a prey to
their own feelings of shame, and to the comments of the crowd. An hour
after they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire.
The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but
they were forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of
curious glances and whispering voices. Eugenie closed her eyes; but
though she could not see, she could hear, and the sneers of the crowd
reached her in the carriage. "Oh, why is not the world a wilderness?"
she exclaimed, throwing herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d'Armilly,
her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that
the Roman world had but one neck, that he might sever it at a single
blow. The next day they stopped at the Hotel de Flandre, at Brussels.
The same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie.</p>
