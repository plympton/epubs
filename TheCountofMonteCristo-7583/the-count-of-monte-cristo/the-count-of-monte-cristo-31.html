<h2 id="id08861" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 85. The Journey.</h2>

<p id="id08862">Monte Cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men
together. "Ah, ha!" said he, "I hope all is over, explained and
settled."</p>

<p id="id08863">"Yes," said Beauchamp; "the absurd reports have died away, and should
they be renewed, I would be the first to oppose them; so let us speak no
more of it."</p>

<p id="id08864">"Albert will tell you," replied the count "that I gave him the same
advice. Look," added he. "I am finishing the most execrable morning's
work."</p>

<p id="id08865">"What is it?" said Albert; "arranging your papers, apparently."</p>

<p id="id08866">"My papers, thank God, no,&#8212;my papers are all in capital order, because<br/>

I have none; but M. Cavalcanti's."<br/></p>

<p id="id08867">"M. Cavalcanti's?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id08868">"Yes; do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is
introducing?" said Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id08869">"Let us not misunderstand each other," replied Monte Cristo; "I
introduce no one, and certainly not M. Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id08870">"And who," said Albert with a forced smile, "is to marry Mademoiselle<br/>

Danglars instead of me, which grieves me cruelly."<br/></p>

<p id="id08871">"What? Cavalcanti is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?" asked<br/>

Beauchamp.<br/></p>

<p id="id08872">"Certainly; do you come from the end of the world?" said Monte Cristo;
"you, a journalist, the husband of renown? It is the talk of all Paris."</p>

<p id="id08873">"And you, count, have made this match?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id08874">"I? Silence, purveyor of gossip, do not spread that report. I make a
match? No, you do not know me; I have done all in my power to oppose
it."</p>

<p id="id08875">"Ah, I understand," said Beauchamp, "on our friend Albert's account."</p>

<p id="id08876">"On my account?" said the young man; "oh, no, indeed, the count will do
me the justice to assert that I have, on the contrary, always entreated
him to break off my engagement, and happily it is ended. The count
pretends I have not him to thank;&#8212;so be it&#8212;I will erect an altar Deo
ignoto."</p>

<p id="id08877">"Listen," said Monte Cristo; "I have had little to do with it, for I am
at variance both with the father-in-law and the young man; there is only
Mademoiselle Eugenie, who appears but little charmed with the thoughts
of matrimony, and who, seeing how little I was disposed to persuade her
to renounce her dear liberty, retains any affection for me."</p>

<p id="id08878">"And do you say this wedding is at hand?"</p>

<p id="id08879">"Oh, yes, in spite of all I could say. I do not know the young man;
he is said to be of good family and rich, but I never trust to vague
assertions. I have warned M. Danglars of it till I am tired, but he
is fascinated with his Luccanese. I have even informed him of a
circumstance I consider very serious; the young man was either charmed
by his nurse, stolen by gypsies, or lost by his tutor, I scarcely know
which. But I do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten
years; what he did during these ten years, God only knows. Well, all
that was useless. They have commissioned me to write to the major to
demand papers, and here they are. I send them, but like Pilate&#8212;washing
my hands."</p>

<p id="id08880">"And what does Mademoiselle d'Armilly say to you for robbing her of her
pupil?"</p>

<p id="id08881">"Oh, well, I don't know; but I understand that she is going to
Italy. Madame Danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the
impresari; I gave her a few lines for the director of the Valle Theatre,
who is under some obligation to me. But what is the matter, Albert? you
look dull; are you, after all, unconsciously in love with Mademoiselle
Eugenie?"</p>

<p id="id08882">"I am not aware of it," said Albert, smiling sorrowfully. Beauchamp
turned to look at some paintings. "But," continued Monte Cristo, "you
are not in your usual spirits?"</p>

<p id="id08883">"I have a dreadful headache," said Albert.</p>

<p id="id08884">"Well, my dear viscount," said Monte Cristo, "I have an infallible
remedy to propose to you."</p>

<p id="id08885">"What is that?" asked the young man.</p>

<p id="id08886">"A change."</p>

<p id="id08887">"Indeed?" said Albert.</p>

<p id="id08888">"Yes; and as I am just now excessively annoyed, I shall go from home.<br/>

Shall we go together?"<br/></p>

<p id="id08889">"You annoyed, count?" said Beauchamp; "and by what?"</p>

<p id="id08890">"Ah, you think very lightly of it; I should like to see you with a brief
preparing in your house."</p>

<p id="id08891">"What brief?"</p>

<p id="id08892">"The one M. de Villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin&#8212;some
brigand escaped from the gallows apparently."</p>

<p id="id08893">"True," said Beauchamp; "I saw it in the paper. Who is this Caderousse?"</p>

<p id="id08894">"Some provincial, it appears. M. de Villefort heard of him at
Marseilles, and M. Danglars recollects having seen him. Consequently,
the procureur is very active in the affair, and the prefect of police
very much interested; and, thanks to that interest, for which I am very
grateful, they send me all the robbers of Paris and the neighborhood,
under pretence of their being Caderousse's murderers, so that in three
months, if this continues, every robber and assassin in France will have
the plan of my house at his fingers' end. I am resolved to desert them
and go to some remote corner of the earth, and shall be happy if you
will accompany me, viscount."</p>

<p id="id08895">"Willingly."</p>

<p id="id08896">"Then it is settled?"</p>

<p id="id08897">"Yes, but where?"</p>

<p id="id08898">"I have told you, where the air is pure, where every sound soothes,
where one is sure to be humbled, however proud may be his nature. I love
that humiliation, I, who am master of the universe, as was Augustus."</p>

<p id="id08899">"But where are you really going?"</p>

<p id="id08900">"To sea, viscount; you know I am a sailor. I was rocked when an infant
in the arms of old ocean, and on the bosom of the beautiful Amphitrite;
I have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of
the other; I love the sea as a mistress, and pine if I do not often see
her."</p>

<p id="id08901">"Let us go, count."</p>

<p id="id08902">"To sea?"</p>

<p id="id08903">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id08904">"You accept my proposal?"</p>

<p id="id08905">"I do."</p>

<p id="id08906">"Well, Viscount, there will be in my court-yard this evening a good
travelling britzka, with four post-horses, in which one may rest as in a
bed. M. Beauchamp, it holds four very well, will you accompany us?"</p>

<p id="id08907">"Thank you, I have just returned from sea."</p>

<p id="id08908">"What? you have been to sea?"</p>

<p id="id08909">"Yes; I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean Islands." [*]</p>

<p id="id08910">     * Lake Maggiore.</p>

<p id="id08911">"What of that? come with us," said Albert.</p>

<p id="id08912">"No, dear Morcerf; you know I only refuse when the thing is impossible.
Besides, it is important," added he in a low tone, "that I should remain
in Paris just now to watch the paper."</p>

<p id="id08913">"Ah, you are a good and an excellent friend," said Albert; "yes, you are
right; watch, watch, Beauchamp, and try to discover the enemy who made
this disclosure." Albert and Beauchamp parted, the last pressure of
their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger.</p>

<p id="id08914">"Beauchamp is a worthy fellow," said Monte Cristo, when the journalist
was gone; "is he not, Albert?"</p>

<p id="id08915">"Yes, and a sincere friend; I love him devotedly. But now we are
alone,&#8212;although it is immaterial to me,&#8212;where are we going?"</p>

<p id="id08916">"Into Normandy, if you like."</p>

<p id="id08917">"Delightful; shall we be quite retired? have no society, no neighbors?"</p>

<p id="id08918">"Our companions will be riding-horses, dogs to hunt with, and a
fishing-boat."</p>

<p id="id08919">"Exactly what I wish for; I will apprise my mother of my intention, and
return to you."</p>

<p id="id08920">"But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy?"</p>

<p id="id08921">"I may go where I please."</p>

<p id="id08922">"Yes, I am aware you may go alone, since I once met you in Italy&#8212;but to
accompany the mysterious Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id08923">"You forget, count, that I have often told you of the deep interest my
mother takes in you."</p>

<p id="id08924">"'Woman is fickle.' said Francis I.; 'woman is like a wave of the sea,'
said Shakespeare; both the great king and the great poet ought to have
known woman's nature well."</p>

<p id="id08925">"Woman's, yes; my mother is not woman, but a woman."</p>

<p id="id08926">"As I am only a humble foreigner, you must pardon me if I do not
understand all the subtle refinements of your language."</p>

<p id="id08927">"What I mean to say is, that my mother is not quick to give her
confidence, but when she does she never changes."</p>

<p id="id08928">"Ah, yes, indeed," said Monte Cristo with a sigh; "and do you think she
is in the least interested in me?"</p>

<p id="id08929">"I repeat it, you must really be a very strange and superior man, for my
mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited, that when I am
with her she speaks of no one else."</p>

<p id="id08930">"And does she try to make you dislike me?"</p>

<p id="id08931">"On the contrary, she often says, 'Morcerf, I believe the count has a
noble nature; try to gain his esteem.'"</p>

<p id="id08932">"Indeed?" said Monte Cristo, sighing.</p>

<p id="id08933">"You see, then," said Albert, "that instead of opposing, she will
encourage me."</p>

<p id="id08934">"Adieu, then, until five o'clock; be punctual, and we shall arrive at
twelve or one."</p>

<p id="id08935">"At Treport?"</p>

<p id="id08936">"Yes; or in the neighborhood."</p>

<p id="id08937">"But can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours?"</p>

<p id="id08938">"Easily," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id08939">"You are certainly a prodigy; you will soon not only surpass the
railway, which would not be very difficult in France, but even the
telegraph."</p>

<p id="id08940">"But, viscount, since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven
or eight hours, do not keep me waiting."</p>

<p id="id08941">"Do not fear, I have little to prepare." Monte Cristo smiled as he
nodded to Albert, then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation.
But passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his revery,
he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio entered. "Bertuccio," said he, "I
intend going this evening to Normandy, instead of to-morrow or the
next day. You will have sufficient time before five o'clock; despatch a
messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station. M. de Morcerf will
accompany me." Bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to
say the travelling-carriage would arrive at six o'clock. From Pontoise
another express was sent to the next stage, and in six hours all the
horses stationed on the road were ready. Before his departure, the
count went to Haidee's apartments, told her his intention, and resigned
everything to her care. Albert was punctual. The journey soon became
interesting from its rapidity, of which Morcerf had formed no previous
idea. "Truly," said Monte Cristo, "with your posthorses going at the
rate of two leagues an hour, and that absurd law that one traveller
shall not pass another without permission, so that an invalid or
ill-tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active, it is
impossible to move; I escape this annoyance by travelling with my own
postilion and horses; do I not, Ali?"</p>

<p id="id08942">The count put his head out of the window and whistled, and the horses
appeared to fly. The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the
pavement, and every one turned to notice the dazzling meteor. Ali,
smiling, repeated the sound, grasped the reins with a firm hand, and
spurred his horses, whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze. This
child of the desert was in his element, and with his black face and
sparkling eyes appeared, in the cloud of dust he raised, like the genius
of the simoom and the god of the hurricane. "I never knew till now the
delight of speed," said Morcerf, and the last cloud disappeared from
his brow; "but where the devil do you get such horses? Are they made to
order?"</p>

<p id="id08943">"Precisely," said the count; "six years since I bought a horse in
Hungary remarkable for its swiftness. The thirty-two that we shall
use to-night are its progeny; they are all entirely black, with the
exception of a star upon the forehead."</p>

<p id="id08944">"That is perfectly admirable; but what do you do, count, with all these
horses?"</p>

<p id="id08945">"You see, I travel with them."</p>

<p id="id08946">"But you are not always travelling."</p>

<p id="id08947">"When I no longer require them, Bertuccio will sell them, and he expects
to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale."</p>

<p id="id08948">"But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them."</p>

<p id="id08949">"Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier, who will empty his
coffers to purchase them, and refill them by applying the bastinado to
his subjects."</p>

<p id="id08950">"Count, may I suggest one idea to you?"</p>

<p id="id08951">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id08952">"It is that, next to you, Bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in<br/>

Europe."<br/></p>

<p id="id08953">"You are mistaken, viscount; I believe he has not a franc in his
possession."</p>

<p id="id08954">"Then he must be a wonder. My dear count, if you tell me many more
marvellous things, I warn you I shall not believe them."</p>

<p id="id08955">"I countenance nothing that is marvellous, M. Albert. Tell me, why does
a steward rob his master?"</p>

<p id="id08956">"Because, I suppose, it is his nature to do so, for the love of
robbing."</p>

<p id="id08957">"You are mistaken; it is because he has a wife and family, and ambitious
desires for himself and them. Also because he is not sure of always
retaining his situation, and wishes to provide for the future. Now, M.
Bertuccio is alone in the world; he uses my property without accounting
for the use he makes of it; he is sure never to leave my service."</p>

<p id="id08958">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id08959">"Because I should never get a better."</p>

<p id="id08960">"Probabilities are deceptive."</p>

<p id="id08961">"But I deal in certainties; he is the best servant over whom one has the
power of life and death."</p>

<p id="id08962">"Do you possess that right over Bertuccio?"</p>

<p id="id08963">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id08964">There are words which close a conversation with an iron door; such was
the count's "yes." The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity;
the thirty-two horses, dispersed over seven stages, brought them to
their destination in eight hours. At midnight they arrived at the gate
of a beautiful park. The porter was in attendance; he had been apprised
by the groom of the last stage of the count's approach. At half past two
in the morning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments, where a bath and
supper were prepared. The servant who had travelled at the back of
the carriage waited on him; Baptistin, who rode in front, attended the
count. Albert bathed, took his supper, and went to bed. All night he was
lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf. On rising, he went to his
window, which opened on a terrace, having the sea in front, and at the
back a pretty park bounded by a small forest. In a creek lay a little
sloop, with a narrow keel and high masts, bearing on its flag the Monte
Cristo arms which were a mountain on a sea azure, with a cross gules
on the shield. Around the schooner lay a number of small fishing-boats
belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village, like humble
subjects awaiting orders from their queen. There, as in every spot where
Monte Cristo stopped, if but for two days, luxury abounded and life went
on with the utmost ease.</p>

<p id="id08965">Albert found in his anteroom two guns, with all the accoutrements for
hunting; a lofty room on the ground-floor containing all the ingenious
instruments the English&#8212;eminent in piscatory pursuits, since they
are patient and sluggish&#8212;have invented for fishing. The day passed in
pursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo excelled. They killed
a dozen pheasants in the park, as many trout in the stream, dined in a
summer-house overlooking the ocean, and took tea in the library.</p>

<p id="id08966">Towards the evening of the third day. Albert, completely exhausted
with the exercise which invigorated Monte Cristo, was sleeping in
an arm-chair near the window, while the count was designing with his
architect the plan of a conservatory in his house, when the sound of
a horse at full speed on the high road made Albert look up. He was
disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre, whom he had not
brought, that he might not inconvenience Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id08967">"Florentin here!" cried he, starting up; "is my mother ill?" And he
hastened to the door. Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the
valet, who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket, containing a
newspaper and a letter. "From whom is this?" said he eagerly. "From M.
Beauchamp," replied Florentin.</p>

<p id="id08968">"Did he send you?"</p>

<p id="id08969">"Yes, sir; he sent for me to his house, gave me money for my journey,
procured a horse, and made me promise not to stop till I had reached
you, I have come in fifteen hours."</p>

<p id="id08970">Albert opened the letter with fear, uttered a shriek on reading the
first line, and seized the paper. His sight was dimmed, his legs sank
under him, and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported him.</p>

<p id="id08971">"Poor young man," said Monte Cristo in a low voice; "it is then true
that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and
fourth generation." Meanwhile Albert had revived, and, continuing to
read, he threw back his head, saying, "Florentin, is your horse fit to
return immediately?"</p>

<p id="id08972">"It is a poor lame post-horse."</p>

<p id="id08973">"In what state was the house when you left?"</p>

<p id="id08974">"All was quiet, but on returning from M. Beauchamp's, I found madame in
tears: she had sent for me to know when you would return. I told her my
orders from M. Beauchamp; she first extended her arms to prevent me, but
after a moment's reflection, 'Yes, go, Florentin,' said she, 'and may he
come quickly.'"</p>

<p id="id08975">"Yes, my mother," said Albert, "I will return, and woe to the infamous
wretch! But first of all I must get there."</p>

<p id="id08976">He went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo. Five minutes
had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance. His
voice had become rough and hoarse; his face was furrowed with wrinkles;
his eyes burned under the blue-veined lids, and he tottered like a
drunken man. "Count," said he, "I thank you for your hospitality, which
I would gladly have enjoyed longer; but I must return to Paris."</p>

<p id="id08977">"What has happened?"</p>

<p id="id08978">"A great misfortune, more important to me than life. Don't question me,<br/>

I beg of you, but lend me a horse."<br/></p>

<p id="id08979">"My stables are at your command, viscount; but you will kill yourself by
riding on horseback. Take a post-chaise or a carriage."</p>

<p id="id08980">"No, it would delay me, and I need the fatigue you warn me of; it will
do me good." Albert reeled as if he had been shot, and fell on a chair
near the door. Monte Cristo did not see this second manifestation of
physical exhaustion; he was at the window, calling, "Ali, a horse for
M. de Morcerf&#8212;quick! he is in a hurry!" These words restored Albert;
he darted from the room, followed by the count. "Thank you!" cried he,
throwing himself on his horse. "Return as soon as you can, Florentin.
Must I use any password to procure a horse?"</p>

<p id="id08981">"Only dismount; another will be immediately saddled." Albert hesitated a
moment. "You may think my departure strange and foolish," said the young
man; "you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one.
Read that," said he, "when I am gone, that you may not be witness of my
anger."</p>

<p id="id08982">While the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse, which
leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus, and shot away
with the rapidity of an arrow. The count watched him with a feeling of
compassion, and when he had completely disappeared, read as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08983">"The French officer in the service of Ali Pasha of Yanina alluded to
three weeks since in the Impartial, who not only surrendered the castle
of Yanina, but sold his benefactor to the Turks, styled himself truly at
that time Fernand, as our esteemed contemporary states; but he has since
added to his Christian name a title of nobility and a family name. He
now calls himself the Count of Morcerf, and ranks among the peers."</p>

<p id="id08984">Thus the terrible secret, which Beauchamp had so generously destroyed,
appeared again like an armed phantom; and another paper, deriving its
information from some malicious source, had published two days after
Albert's departure for Normandy the few lines which had rendered the
unfortunate young man almost crazy.</p>

<h2 id="id08985" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 86. The Trial.</h2>

<p id="id08986">At eight o'clock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamp's
door. The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once.
Beauchamp was in his bath. "Here I am," said Albert.</p>

<p id="id08987">"Well, my poor friend," replied Beauchamp, "I expected you."</p>

<p id="id08988">"I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken
of that painful circumstance. Your having sent for me is another proof
of your affection. So, without losing time, tell me, have you the
slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds?"</p>

<p id="id08989">"I think I have some clew."</p>

<p id="id08990">"But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot." Beauchamp
proceeded to relate to the young man, who was overwhelmed with shame
and grief, the following facts. Two days previously, the article had
appeared in another paper besides the Impartial, and, what was more
serious, one that was well known as a government paper. Beauchamp was
breakfasting when he read the paragraph. He sent immediately for a
cabriolet, and hastened to the publisher's office. Although professing
diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other
paper, Beauchamp&#8212;as it sometimes, we may say often, happens&#8212;was
his intimate friend. The editor was reading, with apparent delight, a
leading article in the same paper on beet-sugar, probably a composition
of his own.</p>

<p id="id08991">"Ah, pardieu," said Beauchamp, "with the paper in your hand, my friend,<br/>

I need not tell you the cause of my visit."<br/></p>

<p id="id08992">"Are you interested in the sugar question?" asked the editor of the
ministerial paper.</p>

<p id="id08993">"No," replied Beauchamp, "I have not considered the question; a totally
different subject interests me."</p>

<p id="id08994">"What is it?"</p>

<p id="id08995">"The article relative to Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id08996">"Indeed? Is it not a curious affair?"</p>

<p id="id08997">"So curious, that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution
for defamation of character."</p>

<p id="id08998">"Not at all; we have received with the information all the requisite
proofs, and we are quite sure M. de Morcerf will not raise his voice
against us; besides, it is rendering a service to one's country to
denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed
on them." Beauchamp was thunderstruck. "Who, then, has so correctly
informed you?" asked he; "for my paper, which gave the first information
on the subject, has been obliged to stop for want of proof; and yet we
are more interested than you in exposing M. de Morcerf, as he is a peer
of France, and we are of the opposition."</p>

<p id="id08999">"Oh, that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize. This news
was brought to us. A man arrived yesterday from Yanina, bringing a
formidable array of documents; and when we hesitated to publish the
accusatory article, he told us it should be inserted in some other
paper."</p>

<p id="id09000">Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit, and left the
office to despatch a courier to Morcerf. But he had been unable to send
to Albert the following particulars, as the events had transpired after
the messenger's departure; namely, that the same day a great agitation
was manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of
that dignified assembly. Every one had arrived almost before the usual
hour, and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract
the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious
colleagues. Some were perusing the article, others making comments and
recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more. The
Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues. Like all upstarts,
he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his
position. The true nobility laughed at him, the talented repelled him,
and the honorable instinctively despised him. He was, in fact, in the
unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice; the finger of God
once pointed at him, every one was prepared to raise the hue and cry.</p>

<p id="id09001">The Count of Morcerf alone was ignorant of the news. He did not take in
the paper containing the defamatory article, and had passed the morning
in writing letters and in trying a horse. He arrived at his usual hour,
with a proud look and insolent demeanor; he alighted, passed through the
corridors, and entered the house without observing the hesitation of
the door-keepers or the coolness of his colleagues. Business had already
been going on for half an hour when he entered. Every one held the
accusing paper, but, as usual, no one liked to take upon himself the
responsibility of the attack. At length an honorable peer, Morcerf's
acknowledged enemy, ascended the tribune with that solemnity which
announced that the expected moment had arrived. There was an impressive
silence; Morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to
an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency. The
count did not notice the introduction, in which the speaker announced
that his communication would be of that vital importance that it
demanded the undivided attention of the House; but at the mention of
Yanina and Colonel Fernand, he turned so frightfully pale that every
member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him. Moral wounds have this
peculiarity,&#8212;they may be hidden, but they never close; always painful,
always ready to bleed when touched, they remain fresh and open in the
heart.</p>

<p id="id09002">The article having been read during the painful hush that followed, a
universal shudder pervaded the assembly, and immediately the closest
attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks. He stated
his scruples and the difficulties of the case; it was the honor of M.
de Morcerf, and that of the whole House, he proposed to defend, by
provoking a debate on personal questions, which are always such painful
themes of discussion. He concluded by calling for an investigation,
which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to
spread, and restore M. de Morcerf to the position he had long held in
public opinion. Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and
unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he
looked around on the assembly. This timidity, which might proceed from
the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt, conciliated
some in his favor; for men who are truly generous are always ready to
compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of
their hatred.</p>

<p id="id09003">The president put it to the vote, and it was decided that the
investigation should take place. The count was asked what time he
required to prepare his defence. Morcerf's courage had revived when he
found himself alive after this horrible blow. "My lords," answered
he, "it is not by time I could repel the attack made on me by enemies
unknown to me, and, doubtless, hidden in obscurity; it is immediately,
and by a thunderbolt, that I must repel the flash of lightning which,
for a moment, startled me. Oh, that I could, instead of taking up this
defence, shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that
I am their equal in worth." These words made a favorable impression on
behalf of the accused. "I demand, then, that the examination shall
take place as soon as possible, and I will furnish the house with all
necessary information."</p>

<p id="id09004">"What day do you fix?" asked the president.</p>

<p id="id09005">"To-day I am at your service," replied the count. The president rang
the bell. "Does the House approve that the examination should take place
to-day?"</p>

<p id="id09006">"Yes," was the unanimous answer.</p>

<p id="id09007">A committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought
forward by Morcerf. The investigation would begin at eight o'clock that
evening in the committee-room, and if postponement were necessary, the
proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour. Morcerf
asked leave to retire; he had to collect the documents he had long been
preparing against this storm, which his sagacity had foreseen.</p>

<p id="id09008">Albert listened, trembling now with hope, then with anger, and then
again with shame, for from Beauchamp's confidence he knew his father was
guilty, and he asked himself how, since he was guilty, he could prove
his innocence. Beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative. "What
next?" asked Albert.</p>

<p id="id09009">"What next? My friend, you impose a painful task on me. Must you know
all?"</p>

<p id="id09010">"Absolutely; and rather from your lips than another's."</p>

<p id="id09011">"Muster up all your courage, then, for never have you required it more."
Albert passed his hand over his forehead, as if to try his strength, as
a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends
his sword. He thought himself strong enough, for he mistook fever for
energy. "Go on," said he.</p>

<p id="id09012">"The evening arrived; all Paris was in expectation. Many said your
father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him; many
others said he would not appear; while some asserted that they had seen
him start for Brussels; and others went to the police-office to inquire
if he had taken out a passport. I used all my influence with one of the
committee, a young peer of my acquaintance, to get admission to one of
the galleries. He called for me at seven o'clock, and, before any one
had arrived, asked one of the door-keepers to place me in a box. I was
concealed by a column, and might witness the whole of the terrible
scene which was about to take place. At eight o'clock all were in their
places, and M. de Morcerf entered at the last stroke. He held some
papers in his hand; his countenance was calm, and his step firm, and he
was dressed with great care in his military uniform, which was buttoned
completely up to the chin. His presence produced a good effect. The
committee was made up of Liberals, several of whom came forward to shake
hands with him."</p>

<p id="id09013">Albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars, but gratitude
mingled with his sorrow: he would gladly have embraced those who had
given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so
powerfully attacked. "At this moment one of the door-keepers brought
in a letter for the president. 'You are at liberty to speak, M. de
Morcerf,' said the president, as he unsealed the letter; and the count
began his defence, I assure you, Albert, in a most eloquent and skilful
manner. He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up
to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence, since he had
interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor. He
produced the ring, his mark of authority, with which Ali Pasha generally
sealed his letters, and which the latter had given him, that he might,
on his return at any hour of the day or night, gain access to the
presence, even in the harem. Unfortunately, the negotiation failed, and
when he returned to defend his benefactor, he was dead. 'But,' said the
count, 'so great was Ali Pasha's confidence, that on his death-bed he
resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.'" Albert
started on hearing these words; the history of Haidee recurred to him,
and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring, and
the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave. "And what effect
did this discourse produce?" anxiously inquired Albert. "I acknowledge
it affected me, and, indeed, all the committee also," said Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id09014">"Meanwhile, the president carelessly opened the letter which had been
brought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them
again and again, and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf, 'Count,' said he,
'you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and daughter
to your care?'&#8212;'Yes, sir,' replied Morcerf; 'but in that, like all the
rest, misfortune pursued me. On my return, Vasiliki and her daughter
Haidee had disappeared.'&#8212;'Did you know them?'&#8212;'My intimacy with the
pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to
them, and I had seen them above twenty times.'</p>

<p id="id09015">"'Have you any idea what became of them?'&#8212;'Yes, sir; I heard they had
fallen victims to their sorrow, and, perhaps, to their poverty. I was
not rich; my life was in constant danger; I could not seek them, to my
great regret.' The president frowned imperceptibly. 'Gentlemen,' said
he, 'you have heard the Comte de Morcerf's defence. Can you, sir,
produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?'&#8212;'Alas,
no, monsieur,' replied the count; 'all those who surrounded the vizier,
or who knew me at his court, are either dead or gone away, I know not
where. I believe that I alone, of all my countrymen, survived that
dreadful war. I have only the letters of Ali Tepelini, which I have
placed before you; the ring, a token of his good-will, which is here;
and, lastly, the most convincing proof I can offer, after an anonymous
attack, and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and
the purity of my military life.' A murmur of approbation ran through the
assembly; and at this moment, Albert, had nothing more transpired, your
father's cause had been gained. It only remained to put it to the vote,
when the president resumed: 'Gentlemen and you, monsieur,&#8212;you will
not be displeased, I presume, to listen to one who calls himself a very
important witness, and who has just presented himself. He is, doubtless,
come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague. Here is a letter
I have just received on the subject; shall it be read, or shall it
be passed over? and shall we take no notice of this incident?' M. de
Morcerf turned pale, and clinched his hands on the papers he held.
The committee decided to hear the letter; the count was thoughtful and
silent. The president read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09016">"'Mr. President,&#8212;I can furnish the committee of inquiry into the
conduct of the Lieutenant-General the Count of Morcerf in Epirus and in
Macedonia with important particulars.'</p>

<p id="id09017">"The president paused, and the count turned pale. The president looked
at his auditors. 'Proceed,' was heard on all sides. The president
resumed:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09018">"'I was on the spot at the death of Ali Pasha. I was present during his
last moments. I know what is become of Vasiliki and Haidee. I am at the
command of the committee, and even claim the honor of being heard. I
shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you.'</p>

<p id="id09019">"'And who is this witness, or rather this enemy?' asked the count, in
a tone in which there was a visible alteration. 'We shall know,
sir,' replied the president. 'Is the committee willing to hear this
witness?'&#8212;'Yes, yes,' they all said at once. The door-keeper was
called. 'Is there any one in the lobby?' said the president.</p>

<p id="id09020">"'Yes, sir.'&#8212;'Who is it?'&#8212;'A woman, accompanied by a servant.' Every
one looked at his neighbor. 'Bring her in,' said the president. Five
minutes after the door-keeper again appeared; all eyes were fixed on
the door, and I," said Beauchamp, "shared the general expectation and
anxiety. Behind the door-keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large
veil, which completely concealed her. It was evident, from her figure
and the perfumes she had about her, that she was young and fastidious in
her tastes, but that was all. The president requested her to throw
aside her veil, and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian
costume, and was remarkably beautiful."</p>

<p id="id09021">"Ah," said Albert, "it was she."</p>

<p id="id09022">"Who?"</p>

<p id="id09023">"Haidee."</p>

<p id="id09024">"Who told you that?"</p>

<p id="id09025">"Alas, I guess it. But go on, Beauchamp. You see I am calm and strong.<br/>

And yet we must be drawing near the disclosure."<br/></p>

<p id="id09026">"M. de Morcerf," continued Beauchamp, "looked at this woman with
surprise and terror. Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or
death. To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious,
that the interest they had felt for the count's safety became now quite
a secondary matter. The president himself advanced to place a seat for
the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it. As for the
count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs refused
to support him.</p>

<p id="id09027">"'Madame,' said the president, 'you have engaged to furnish the
committee with some important particulars respecting the affair
at Yanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the
event.'&#8212;'I was, indeed,' said the stranger, with a tone of sweet
melancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.</p>

<p id="id09028">"'But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.'&#8212;'I was
four years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single
detail has escaped my memory.'&#8212;'In what manner could these events
concern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an
impression on you?'&#8212;'On them depended my father's life,' replied she.
'I am Haidee, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of
Vasiliki, his beloved wife.'</p>

<p id="id09029">"The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the
cheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly
important communication, produced an indescribable effect on the
assembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if
a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before
him. 'Madame,' replied the president, bowing with profound respect,
'allow me to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the
authenticity of what you have now stated?'&#8212;'I can, sir,' said Haidee,
drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed; 'for here
is the register of my birth, signed by my father and his principal
officers, and that of my baptism, my father having consented to my being
brought up in my mother's faith,&#8212;this latter has been sealed by the
grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus; and lastly (and perhaps the most
important), the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother
to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by the French officer, who, in his
infamous bargain with the Porte, had reserved as his part of the booty
the wife and daughter of his benefactor, whom he sold for the sum of
four hundred thousand francs.' A greenish pallor spread over the count's
cheeks, and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations,
which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence.</p>

<p id="id09030">"Haidee, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of
another would have been, handed to the president the record of her sale,
written in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might be in
the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of the
House was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar
with the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian
campaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09031">"'I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his
highness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime
emperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald
valued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young
Christian slave of eleven years of age, named Haidee, the acknowledged
daughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of
Vasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years
previously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at Constantinople,
by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali Tepelini, named
Fernand Mondego. The above-mentioned purchase was made on his highness's
account, whose mandate I had, for the sum of four hundred thousand
francs.</p>

<p id="id09032">"'Given at Constantinople, by authority of his highness, in the year
1247 of the Hegira.</p>

<p id="id09033">"'Signed El-Kobbir.'</p>

<p id="id09034">"'That this record should have all due authority, it shall bear the
imperial seal, which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it.'</p>

<p id="id09035">"Near the merchant's signature there was, indeed, the seal of the
sublime emperor. A dreadful silence followed the reading of this
document; the count could only stare, and his gaze, fixed as if
unconsciously on Haidee, seemed one of fire and blood. 'Madame,' said
the president, 'may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo,
who is now, I believe, in Paris?'&#8212;'Sir,' replied Haidee, 'the Count
of Monte Cristo, my foster-father, has been in Normandy the last three
days.'</p>

<p id="id09036">"'Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which
the court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural,
considering your birth and your misfortunes?'&#8212;'Sir,' replied Haidee,
'I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief.
Although a Christian, may God forgive me, I have always sought to
revenge my illustrious father. Since I set my foot in France, and knew
the traitor lived in Paris, I have watched carefully. I live retired
in the house of my noble protector, but I do it from choice. I love
retirement and silence, because I can live with my thoughts and
recollections of past days. But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me
with every paternal care, and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in
the world. I learn all in the silence of my apartments,&#8212;for instance, I
see all the newspapers, every periodical, as well as every new piece of
music; and by thus watching the course of the life of others, I learned
what had transpired this morning in the House of Peers, and what was to
take place this evening; then I wrote.'</p>

<p id="id09037">"'Then,' remarked the president, 'the Count of Monte Cristo knows
nothing of your present proceedings?'&#8212;'He is quite unaware of them, and
I have but one fear, which is that he should disapprove of what I
have done. But it is a glorious day for me,' continued the young girl,
raising her ardent gaze to heaven, 'that on which I find at last an
opportunity of avenging my father!'</p>

<p id="id09038">"The count had not uttered one word the whole of this time. His
colleagues looked at him, and doubtless pitied his prospects, blighted
under the perfumed breath of a woman. His misery was depicted in
sinister lines on his countenance. 'M. de Morcerf,' said the president,
'do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of
Yanina?'&#8212;'No,' said Morcerf, attempting to rise, 'it is a base plot,
contrived by my enemies.' Haidee, whose eyes had been fixed on the
door, as if expecting some one, turned hastily, and, seeing the count
standing, shrieked, 'You do not know me?' said she. 'Well, I fortunately
recognize you! You are Fernand Mondego, the French officer who led
the troops of my noble father! It is you who surrendered the castle of
Yanina! It is you who, sent by him to Constantinople, to treat with the
emperor for the life or death of your benefactor, brought back a false
mandate granting full pardon! It is you who, with that mandate, obtained
the pasha's ring, which gave you authority over Selim, the fire-keeper!
It is you who stabbed Selim. It is you who sold us, my mother and me, to
the merchant, El-Kobbir! Assassin, assassin, assassin, you have still on
your brow your master's blood! Look, gentlemen, all!'</p>

<p id="id09039">"These words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth,
that every eye was fixed on the count's forehead, and he himself passed
his hand across it, as if he felt Ali's blood still lingering there.
'You positively recognize M. de Morcerf as the officer, Fernand
Mondego?'&#8212;'Indeed I do!' cried Haidee. 'Oh, my mother, it was you who
said, "You were free, you had a beloved father, you were destined to be
almost a queen. Look well at that man; it is he who raised your father's
head on the point of a spear; it is he who sold us; it is he who forsook
us! Look well at his right hand, on which he has a large wound; if you
forgot his features, you would know him by that hand, into which fell,
one by one, the gold pieces of the merchant El-Kobbir!" I know him!
Ah, let him say now if he does not recognize me!' Each word fell like a
dagger on Morcerf, and deprived him of a portion of his energy; as she
uttered the last, he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom, and
fell back on his seat, overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair. This
scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the
accused count.</p>

<p id="id09040">"'Count of Morcerf,' said the president, 'do not allow yourself to be
cast down; answer. The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as
that of God; it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies
without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself. Shall further
inquiries be made? Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina?
Speak!' Morcerf did not reply. Then all the members looked at each other
with terror. They knew the count's energetic and violent temper; it must
be, indeed, a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend
himself. They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a
fiery outburst. 'Well,' asked the president, 'what is your decision?'</p>

<p id="id09041">"'I have no reply to make,' said the count in a low tone.</p>

<p id="id09042">"'Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth?' said the
president. 'Is she, then, the terrible witness to whose charge you dare
not plead "Not guilty"? Have you really committed the crimes of which
you are accused?' The count looked around him with an expression which
might have softened tigers, but which could not disarm his judges. Then
he raised his eyes towards the ceiling, but withdrew then, immediately,
as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view
that second tribunal called heaven, and that other judge named God.
Then, with a hasty movement, he tore open his coat, which seemed to
stifle him, and flew from the room like a madman; his footstep was heard
one moment in the corridor, then the rattling of his carriage-wheels
as he was driven rapidly away. 'Gentlemen,' said the president, when
silence was restored, 'is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony,
treason, and conduct unbecoming a member of this House?'&#8212;'Yes,' replied
all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice.</p>

<p id="id09043">"Haidee had remained until the close of the meeting. She heard the
count's sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or
pity; then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the
councillors, and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes
to his goddesses."</p>

<h2 id="id09044" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 87. The Challenge.</h2>

<p id="id09045">"Then," continued Beauchamp, "I took advantage of the silence and
the darkness to leave the house without being seen. The usher who
had introduced me was waiting for me at the door, and he conducted me
through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de
Vaugirard. I left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight. Excuse
me, Albert,&#8212;sorrow on your account, and delight with that noble girl,
thus pursuing paternal vengeance. Yes, Albert, from whatever source the
blow may have proceeded&#8212;it may be from an enemy, but that enemy is only
the agent of providence." Albert held his head between his hands;
he raised his face, red with shame and bathed in tears, and seizing
Beauchamp's arm, "My friend," said he, "my life is ended. I cannot
calmly say with you, 'Providence has struck the blow;' but I must
discover who pursues me with this hatred, and when I have found him I
shall kill him, or he will kill me. I rely on your friendship to assist
me, Beauchamp, if contempt has not banished it from your heart."</p>

<p id="id09046">"Contempt, my friend? How does this misfortune affect you? No, happily
that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for
the father's actions. Review your life, Albert; although it is only just
beginning, did a lovely summer's day ever dawn with greater purity than
has marked the commencement of your career? No, Albert, take my advice.
You are young and rich&#8212;leave Paris&#8212;all is soon forgotten in this great
Babylon of excitement and changing tastes. You will return after three
or four years with a Russian princess for a bride, and no one will think
more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years
ago."</p>

<p id="id09047">"Thank you, my dear Beauchamp, thank you for the excellent feeling
which prompts your advice; but it cannot be. I have told you my wish, or
rather my determination. You understand that, interested as I am in this
affair, I cannot see it in the same light as you do. What appears to you
to emanate from a celestial source, seems to me to proceed from one far
less pure. Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair; and
happily so, for instead of the invisible, impalpable agent of celestial
rewards and punishments, I shall find one both palpable and visible,
on whom I shall revenge myself, I assure you, for all I have suffered
during the last month. Now, I repeat, Beauchamp, I wish to return
to human and material existence, and if you are still the friend you
profess to be, help me to discover the hand that struck the blow."</p>

<p id="id09048">"Be it so," said Beauchamp; "if you must have me descend to earth, I
submit; and if you will seek your enemy, I will assist you, and I
will engage to find him, my honor being almost as deeply interested as
yours."</p>

<p id="id09049">"Well, then, you understand, Beauchamp, that we begin our search
immediately. Each moment's delay is an eternity for me. The calumniator
is not yet punished, and he may hope that he will not be; but, on my
honor, if he thinks so, he deceives himself."</p>

<p id="id09050">"Well, listen, Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id09051">"Ah, Beauchamp, I see you know something already; you will restore me to
life."</p>

<p id="id09052">"I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you, but it
is, at least, a ray of light in a dark night; by following it we may,
perhaps, discover something more certain."</p>

<p id="id09053">"Tell me; satisfy my impatience."</p>

<p id="id09054">"Well, I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from<br/>

Yanina."<br/></p>

<p id="id09055">"Say on."</p>

<p id="id09056">"I went, of course, to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries.<br/>

At the first word, before I had even mentioned your father's name"&#8212;<br/></p>

<p id="id09057">"'Ah,' said he. 'I guess what brings you here.'</p>

<p id="id09058">"'How, and why?'</p>

<p id="id09059">"'Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same subject.'</p>

<p id="id09060">"'By whom?'&#8212;'By a Paris banker, my correspondent.'</p>

<p id="id09061">"'Whose name is'&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09062">"'Danglars.'"</p>

<p id="id09063">"He!" cried Albert; "yes, it is indeed he who has so long pursued my
father with jealous hatred. He, the man who would be popular, cannot
forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer; and this marriage
broken off without a reason being assigned&#8212;yes, it is all from the same
cause."</p>

<p id="id09064">"Make inquiries, Albert, but do not be angry without reason; make
inquiries, and if it be true"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09065">"Oh, yes, if it be true," cried the young man, "he shall pay me all I
have suffered."</p>

<p id="id09066">"Beware, Morcerf, he is already an old man."</p>

<p id="id09067">"I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family; if
my father had offended him, why did he not attack him personally? Oh,
no, he was afraid to encounter him face to face."</p>

<p id="id09068">"I do not condemn you, Albert; I only restrain you. Act prudently."</p>

<p id="id09069">"Oh, do not fear; besides, you will accompany me. Beauchamp, solemn
transactions should be sanctioned by a witness. Before this day closes,
if M. Danglars is guilty, he shall cease to live, or I shall die.
Pardieu, Beauchamp, mine shall be a splendid funeral!"</p>

<p id="id09070">"When such resolutions are made, Albert, they should be promptly
executed. Do you wish to go to M. Danglars? Let us go immediately." They
sent for a cabriolet. On entering the banker's mansion, they perceived
the phaeton and servant of M. Andrea Cavalcanti. "Ah, parbleu, that's
good," said Albert, with a gloomy tone. "If M. Danglars will not fight
with me, I will kill his son-in-law; Cavalcanti will certainly fight."
The servant announced the young man; but the banker, recollecting
what had transpired the day before, did not wish him admitted. It was,
however, too late; Albert had followed the footman, and, hearing the
order given, forced the door open, and followed by Beauchamp found
himself in the banker's study. "Sir," cried the latter, "am I no longer
at liberty to receive whom I choose in my house? You appear to forget
yourself sadly."</p>

<p id="id09071">"No, sir," said Albert, coldly; "there are circumstances in which one
cannot, except through cowardice,&#8212;I offer you that refuge,&#8212;refuse to
admit certain persons at least."</p>

<p id="id09072">"What is your errand, then, with me, sir?"</p>

<p id="id09073">"I mean," said Albert, drawing near, and without apparently noticing
Cavalcanti, who stood with his back towards the fireplace&#8212;"I mean to
propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us
for ten minutes; that will be sufficient&#8212;where two men having met, one
of them will remain on the ground." Danglars turned pale; Cavalcanti
moved a step forward, and Albert turned towards him. "And you, too,"
said he, "come, if you like, monsieur; you have a claim, being almost
one of the family, and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I
can find persons willing to accept them." Cavalcanti looked at Danglars
with a stupefied air, and the latter, making an effort, arose and
stepped between the two young men. Albert's attack on Andrea had placed
him on a different footing, and he hoped this visit had another cause
than that he had at first supposed.</p>

<p id="id09074">"Indeed, sir," said he to Albert, "if you are come to quarrel with this
gentleman because I have preferred him to you, I shall resign the case
to the king's attorney."</p>

<p id="id09075">"You mistake, sir," said Morcerf with a gloomy smile; "I am not
referring in the least to matrimony, and I only addressed myself to M.
Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us. In one
respect you are right, for I am ready to quarrel with every one to-day;
but you have the first claim, M. Danglars."</p>

<p id="id09076">"Sir," replied Danglars, pale with anger and fear, "I warn you, when
I have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog, I kill it; and far from
thinking myself guilty of a crime, I believe I do society a kindness.
Now, if you are mad and try to bite me, I will kill you without pity. Is
it my fault that your father has dishonored himself?"</p>

<p id="id09077">"Yes, miserable wretch!" cried Morcerf, "it is your fault." Danglars
retreated a few steps. "My fault?" said he; "you must be mad! What do
I know of the Grecian affair? Have I travelled in that country? Did I
advise your father to sell the castle of Yanina&#8212;to betray"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09078">"Silence!" said Albert, with a thundering voice. "No; it is not you who
have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us, but you
hypocritically provoked it."</p>

<h5 id="id09079">"I?"</h5>

<p id="id09080">"Yes; you! How came it known?"</p>

<p id="id09081">"I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina?"</p>

<p id="id09082">"Who wrote to Yanina?"</p>

<p id="id09083">"To Yanina?"</p>

<p id="id09084">"Yes. Who wrote for particulars concerning my father?"</p>

<p id="id09085">"I imagine any one may write to Yanina."</p>

<p id="id09086">"But one person only wrote!"</p>

<p id="id09087">"One only?"</p>

<p id="id09088">"Yes; and that was you!"</p>

<p id="id09089">"I, doubtless, wrote. It appears to me that when about to marry your
daughter to a young man, it is right to make some inquiries respecting
his family; it is not only a right, but a duty."</p>

<p id="id09090">"You wrote, sir, knowing what answer you would receive."</p>

<p id="id09091">"I, indeed? I assure you," cried Danglars, with a confidence and
security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt
for the young man, "I solemnly declare to you, that I should never
have thought of writing to Yanina, did I know anything of Ali Pasha's
misfortunes."</p>

<p id="id09092">"Who, then, urged you to write? Tell me."</p>

<p id="id09093">"Pardieu, it was the most simple thing in the world. I was speaking of
your father's past history. I said the origin of his fortune remained
obscure. The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your
father had acquired his property? I answered, 'In Greece.'&#8212;'Then,' said
he, 'write to Yanina.'"</p>

<p id="id09094">"And who thus advised you?"</p>

<p id="id09095">"No other than your friend, Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id09096">"The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina?"</p>

<p id="id09097">"Yes; and I wrote, and will show you my correspondence, if you like."<br/>

Albert and Beauchamp looked at each other. "Sir," said Beauchamp, who<br/>

had not yet spoken, "you appear to accuse the count, who is absent from<br/>

Paris at this moment, and cannot justify himself."<br/></p>

<p id="id09098">"I accuse no one, sir," said Danglars; "I relate, and I will repeat
before the count what I have said to you."</p>

<p id="id09099">"Does the count know what answer you received?"</p>

<p id="id09100">"Yes; I showed it to him."</p>

<p id="id09101">"Did he know my father's Christian name was Fernand, and his family name<br/>

Mondego?"<br/></p>

<p id="id09102">"Yes, I had told him that long since, and I did only what any other
would have done in my circumstances, and perhaps less. When, the day
after the arrival of this answer, your father came by the advice of
Monte Cristo to ask my daughter's hand for you, I decidedly refused him,
but without any explanation or exposure. In short, why should I have
any more to do with the affair? How did the honor or disgrace of M. de
Morcerf affect me? It neither increased nor decreased my income."</p>

<p id="id09103">Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow; there was no doubt upon the
subject. Danglars defended himself with the baseness, but at the same
time with the assurance, of a man who speaks the truth, at least
in part, if not wholly&#8212;not for conscience' sake, but through fear.
Besides, what was Morcerf seeking? It was not whether Danglars or Monte
Cristo was more or less guilty; it was a man who would answer for the
offence, whether trifling or serious; it was a man who would fight,
and it was evident Danglars would not fight. And, in addition to this,
everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to
his recollection. Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the
daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars
to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert's wish
to be introduced to Haidee, and allowed the conversation to turn on
the death of Ali, and had not opposed Haidee's recital (but having,
doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to
her, not to implicate Morcerf's father). Besides, had he not begged of
Morcerf not to mention his father's name before Haidee? Lastly, he had
taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There
could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged;
Monte Cristo then was in league with his father's enemies. Albert took
Beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him.</p>

<p id="id09104">"You are right," said the latter; "M. Danglars has only been a secondary
agent in this sad affair, and it is of M. de Monte Cristo that you
must demand an explanation." Albert turned. "Sir," said he to Danglars,
"understand that I do not take a final leave of you; I must ascertain if
your insinuations are just, and am going now to inquire of the Count
of Monte Cristo." He bowed to the banker, and went out with Beauchamp,
without appearing to notice Cavalcanti. Danglars accompanied him to the
door, where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred
had influenced him against the Count of Morcerf.</p>

<h2 id="id09105" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 88. The Insult.</h2>

<p id="id09106">At the banker's door Beauchamp stopped Morcerf. "Listen," said he;
"just now I told you it was of M. de Monte Cristo you must demand an
explanation."</p>

<p id="id09107">"Yes; and we are going to his house."</p>

<p id="id09108">"Reflect, Morcerf, one moment before you go."</p>

<p id="id09109">"On what shall I reflect?"</p>

<p id="id09110">"On the importance of the step you are taking."</p>

<p id="id09111">"Is it more serious than going to M. Danglars?"</p>

<p id="id09112">"Yes; M. Danglars is a money-lover, and those who love money, you know,
think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel.
The other is, on the contrary, to all appearance a true nobleman; but do
you not fear to find him a bully?"</p>

<p id="id09113">"I only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight."</p>

<p id="id09114">"Do not be alarmed," said Beauchamp; "he will meet you. My only fear is
that he will be too strong for you."</p>

<p id="id09115">"My friend," said Morcerf, with a sweet smile, "that is what I wish. The
happiest thing that could occur to me, would be to die in my father's
stead; that would save us all."</p>

<p id="id09116">"Your mother would die of grief."</p>

<p id="id09117">"My poor mother!" said Albert, passing his hand across his eyes, "I know
she would; but better so than die of shame."</p>

<p id="id09118">"Are you quite decided, Albert?"</p>

<p id="id09119">"Yes; let us go."</p>

<p id="id09120">"But do you think we shall find the count at home?"</p>

<p id="id09121">"He intended returning some hours after me, and doubtless he is now at
home." They ordered the driver to take them to No. 30 Champs-Elysees.
Beauchamp wished to go in alone, but Albert observed that as this was
an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual
etiquette in affairs of honor. The cause which the young man espoused
was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes;
he yielded and contented himself with following Morcerf. Albert sprang
from the porter's lodge to the steps. He was received by Baptistin.
The count had, indeed, just arrived, but he was in his bath, and had
forbidden that any one should be admitted. "But after his bath?" asked
Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id09122">"My master will go to dinner."</p>

<p id="id09123">"And after dinner?"</p>

<p id="id09124">"He will sleep an hour."</p>

<p id="id09125">"Then?"</p>

<p id="id09126">"He is going to the opera."</p>

<p id="id09127">"Are you sure of it?" asked Albert.</p>

<p id="id09128">"Quite, sir; my master has ordered his horses at eight o'clock
precisely."</p>

<p id="id09129">"Very good," replied Albert; "that is all I wished to know." Then,
turning towards Beauchamp, "If you have anything to attend to,
Beauchamp, do it directly; if you have any appointment for this evening,
defer it till tomorrow. I depend on you to accompany me to the opera;
and if you can, bring Chateau-Renaud with you."</p>

<p id="id09130">Beauchamp availed himself of Albert's permission, and left him,
promising to call for him at a quarter before eight. On his return home,
Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray, and Morrel, to see them at
the opera that evening. Then he went to see his mother, who since the
events of the day before had refused to see any one, and had kept
her room. He found her in bed, overwhelmed with grief at this public
humiliation. The sight of Albert produced the effect which might
naturally be expected on Mercedes; she pressed her son's hand and sobbed
aloud, but her tears relieved her. Albert stood one moment speechless by
the side of his mother's bed. It was evident from his pale face and knit
brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker. "My
dear mother," said he, "do you know if M. de Morcerf has any enemy?"
Mercedes started; she noticed that the young man did not say "my
father." "My son," she said, "persons in the count's situation have many
secret enemies. Those who are known are not the most dangerous."</p>

<p id="id09131">"I know it, and appeal to your penetration. You are of so superior a
mind, nothing escapes you."</p>

<p id="id09132">"Why do you say so?"</p>

<p id="id09133">"Because, for instance, you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave,
that M. de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house." Mercedes raised
herself on her feverish arm. "M. de Monte Cristo!" she exclaimed; "and
how is he connected with the question you asked me?"</p>

<p id="id09134">"You know, mother, M. de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental, and it is
customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not
eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies."</p>

<p id="id09135">"Do you say M. de Monte Cristo is our enemy?" replied Mercedes, becoming
paler than the sheet which covered her. "Who told you so? Why, you are
mad, Albert! M. de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness. M. de Monte
Cristo saved your life; you yourself presented him to us. Oh, I entreat
you, my son, if you had entertained such an idea, dispel it; and my
counsel to you&#8212;nay, my prayer&#8212;is to retain his friendship."</p>

<p id="id09136">"Mother," replied the young man, "you have especial reasons for telling
me to conciliate that man."</p>

<p id="id09137">"I?" said Mercedes, blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale, and
again becoming paler than ever.</p>

<p id="id09138">"Yes, doubtless; and is it not that he may never do us any harm?"
Mercedes shuddered, and, fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze, "You
speak strangely," said she to Albert, "and you appear to have some
singular prejudices. What has the count done? Three days since you were
with him in Normandy; only three days since we looked on him as our best
friend."</p>

<p id="id09139">An ironical smile passed over Albert's lips. Mercedes saw it and with
the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all; but as she was
prudent and strong-minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears.
Albert was silent; an instant after, the countess resumed: "You came to
inquire after my health; I will candidly acknowledge that I am not well.
You should install yourself here, and cheer my solitude. I do not wish
to be left alone."</p>

<p id="id09140">"Mother," said the young man, "you know how gladly I would obey your
wish, but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the
whole evening."</p>

<p id="id09141">"Well," replied Mercedes, sighing, "go, Albert; I will not make you a
slave to your filial piety." Albert pretended he did not hear, bowed
to his mother, and quitted her. Scarcely had he shut her door, when
Mercedes called a confidential servant, and ordered him to follow Albert
wherever he should go that evening, and to come and tell her immediately
what he observed. Then she rang for her lady's maid, and, weak as she
was, she dressed, in order to be ready for whatever might happen. The
footman's mission was an easy one. Albert went to his room, and dressed
with unusual care. At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived; he had
seen Chateau-Renaud, who had promised to be in the orchestra before the
curtain was raised. Both got into Albert's coupe; and, as the young man
had no reason to conceal where he was going, he called aloud, "To
the opera." In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the
performance.</p>

<p id="id09142">Chateau-Renaud was at his post; apprised by Beauchamp of the
circumstances, he required no explanation from Albert. The conduct
of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that
Chateau-Renaud did not seek to dissuade him, and was content with
renewing his assurances of devotion. Debray was not yet come, but Albert
knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera. Albert wandered about
the theatre until the curtain was drawn up. He hoped to meet with M. de
Monte Cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs. The bell summoned
him to his seat, and he entered the orchestra with Chateau-Renaud and
Beauchamp. But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns,
which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act. At
last, as Albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time,
at the beginning of the second act the door opened, and Monte Cristo
entered, dressed in black, and, leaning over the front of the box,
looked around the pit. Morrel followed him, and looked also for his
sister and brother in-law; he soon discovered them in another box, and
kissed his hand to them.</p>
