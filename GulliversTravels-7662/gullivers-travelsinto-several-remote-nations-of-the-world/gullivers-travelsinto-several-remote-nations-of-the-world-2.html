<p>The farmer having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature had given me.&#160; He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face.&#160; He called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards learned, whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that resembled me.&#160; He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but I got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let those people see I had no intent to run away.&#160; They all sat down in a circle about me, the better to observe my motions.&#160; I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards the farmer.&#160; I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him.&#160; He received it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it.&#160; Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground.&#160; I then took the purse, and, opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.&#160; There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or thirty smaller coins.&#160; I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were.&#160; He made me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which, after offering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.</p>
<p>The farmer, by this time, was convinced I must be a rational creature.&#160; He spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like that of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough.&#160; I answered as loud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to each other.&#160; He then sent his servants to their work, and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward, making me a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a foot in thickness.&#160; I thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling, laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief, with the remainder of which he lapped me up to the head for further security, and in this manner carried me home to his house.&#160; There he called his wife, and showed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in England do at the sight of a toad or a spider.&#160; However, when she had a while seen my behaviour, and how well I observed the signs her husband made, she was soon reconciled, and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.</p>
<p>It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner.&#160; It was only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a husbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter.&#160; The company were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old grandmother.&#160; When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some distance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the floor.&#160; I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the edge, for fear of falling.&#160; The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled some bread on a trencher, and placed it before me.&#160; I made her a low bow, took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding delight.&#160; The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held about two gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the vessel with much difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner drank to her ladyship&#8217;s health, expressing the words as loud as I could in English, which made the company laugh so heartily, that I was almost deafened with the noise.&#160; This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was not unpleasant.&#160; Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher side; but as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time, as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to stumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt.&#160; I got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much concern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners,) and waving it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had got no mischief by my fall.&#160; But advancing forward towards my master (as I shall henceforth call him,) his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in the air, that I trembled every limb: but his father snatched me from him, and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as would have felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be taken from the table.&#160; But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and pointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might be pardoned.&#160; The father complied, and the lad took his seat again, whereupon I went to him, and kissed his hand, which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.</p>
<p>In the midst of dinner, my mistress&#8217;s favourite cat leaped into her lap.&#160; I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work; and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I computed by the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mistress was feeding and stroking her.&#160; The fierceness of this creature&#8217;s countenance altogether discomposed me; though I stood at the farther end of the table, above fifty feet off; and although my mistress held her fast, for fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons.&#160; But it happened there was no danger, for the cat took not the least notice of me when my master placed me within three yards of her.&#160; And as I have been always told, and found true by experience in my travels, that flying or discovering fear before a fierce animal, is a certain way to make it pursue or attack you, so I resolved, in this dangerous juncture, to show no manner of concern.&#160; I walked with intrepidity five or six times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: I had less apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the room, as it is usual in farmers&#8217; houses; one of which was a mastiff, equal in bulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller than the mastiff, but not so large.</p>
<p>When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might have heard from London-Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory of infants, to get me for a plaything.&#160; The mother, out of pure indulgence, took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently seized me by the middle, and got my head into his mouth, where I roared so loud that the urchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should infallibly have broke my neck, if the mother had not held her apron under me.&#160; The nurse, to quiet her babe, made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones, and fastened by a cable to the child&#8217;s waist: but all in vain; so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by giving it suck.&#160; I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and colour.&#160; It stood prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen in circumference.&#160; The nipple was about half the bigness of my head, and the hue both of that and the dug, so varied with spots, pimples, and freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near sight of her, she sitting down, the more conveniently to give suck, and I standing on the table.&#160; This made me reflect upon the fair skins of our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins look rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.</p>
<p>I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when I took him up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was at first a very shocking sight.&#160; He said, &#8220;he could discover great holes in my skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the bristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colours altogether disagreeable:&#8221; although I must beg leave to say for myself, that I am as fair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburnt by all my travels.&#160; On the other side, discoursing of the ladies in that emperor&#8217;s court, he used to tell me, &#8220;one had freckles; another too wide a mouth; a third too large a nose;&#8221; nothing of which I was able to distinguish.&#160; I confess this reflection was obvious enough; which, however, I could not forbear, lest the reader might think those vast creatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the justice to say, they are a comely race of people, and particularly the features of my master&#8217;s countenance, although he was but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.</p>
<p>When dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to take care of me.&#160; I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a clean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a man-of-war.</p>
<p>I slept about two hours, and dreamt I was at home with my wife and children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked, and found myself alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide.&#160; My mistress was gone about her household affairs, and had locked me in.&#160; The bed was eight yards from the floor.&#160; Some natural necessities required me to get down; I durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in vain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room where I lay to the kitchen where the family kept.&#160; While I was under these circumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed.&#160; One of them came up almost to my face, whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself.&#160; These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief.&#160; He fell down at my feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape, but not without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled, and made the blood run trickling from him.&#160; After this exploit, I walked gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of spirits.&#160; These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but infinitely more nimble and fierce; so that if I had taken off my belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured.&#160; I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet some life, but with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.</p>
<p>Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran and took me up in her hand.&#160; I pointed to the dead rat, smiling, and making other signs to show I was not hurt; whereat she was extremely rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs, and throw it out of the window.&#160; Then she set me on a table, where I showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of my coat, returned it to the scabbard.&#160; I was pressed to do more than one thing which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavoured to make my mistress understand, that I desired to be set down on the floor; which after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself farther, than by pointing to the door, and bowing several times.&#160; The good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what I would be at, and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden, where she set me down.&#160; I went on one side about two hundred yards, and beckoning to her not to look or to follow me, I hid myself between two leaves of sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.</p>
<p>I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the like particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to groveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of public as well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting this and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been chiefly studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of learning or of style.&#160; But the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in committing it to paper I did not omit one material circumstance: however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several passages.&#160; Of less moment which were in my first copy, for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling, whereof travellers are often, perhaps not without justice, accused.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00014">CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A description of the farmer&#8217;s daughter.&#160; The author carried to a market-town, and then to the metropolis.&#160; The particulars of his journey.</p>
<p>My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of towardly parts for her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her baby.&#160; Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby&#8217;s cradle for me against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats.&#160; This was my bed all the time I staid with those people, though made more convenient by degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.&#160; This young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself.&#160; She made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me with her own hands.&#160; She was likewise my school-mistress, to teach me the language: when I pointed to any thing, she told me the name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call for whatever I had a mind to.&#160; She was very good-natured, and not above forty feet high, being little for her age.&#160; She gave me the name of <i>Grildrig</i>, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.&#160; The word imports what the Latins call <i>nanunculus</i>, the Italians <i>homunceletino</i>, and the English <i>mannikin</i>.&#160; To her I chiefly owe my preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I called her my <i>Glumdalclitch</i>, or little nurse; and should be guilty of great ingratitude, if I omitted this honourable mention of her care and affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power to requite as she deserves, instead of being the innocent, but unhappy instrument of her disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.</p>
<p>It now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood, that my master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a <i>splacnuck</i>, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature; which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a little language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs, went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a complexion fairer than a nobleman&#8217;s daughter of three years old.&#160; Another farmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master, came on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.&#160; I was immediately produced, and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my master&#8217;s guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him <i>he was welcome</i>, just as my little nurse had instructed me.&#160; This man, who was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better; at which I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows.&#160; Our people, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of countenance.&#160; He had the character of a great miser; and, to my misfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master, to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which was half an hour&#8217;s riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house.&#160; I guessed there was some mischief when I observed my master and his friend whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy that I overheard and understood some of their words.&#160; But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly picked out from her mother.&#160; The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief.&#160; She apprehended some mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.&#160; She had also observed how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honour, and what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for money as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people.&#160; She said, her papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.&#160; For my own part, I may truly affirm, that I was less concerned than my nurse.&#160; I had a strong hope, which never left me, that I should one day recover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach, if ever I should return to England, since the king of Great Britain himself, in my condition, must have undergone the same distress.</p>
<p>My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the next market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him his little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.&#160; The box was close on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few gimlet holes to let in air.&#160; The girl had been so careful as to put the quilt of her baby&#8217;s bed into it, for me to lie down on.&#160; However, I was terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it was but of half an hour: for the horse went about forty feet at every step and trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.&#160; Our journey was somewhat farther than from London to St. Alban&#8217;s.&#160; My master alighted at an inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting awhile with the inn-keeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the <i>grultrud</i>, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange creature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a <i>splacnuck</i> (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six feet long,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature, could speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.</p>
<p>I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be near three hundred feet square.&#160; My little nurse stood on a low stool close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do.&#160; My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to see me.&#160; I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me questions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached, and I answered them as loud as I could.&#160; I turned about several times to the company, paid my humble respects, said <i>they were welcome</i>, and used some other speeches I had been taught.&#160; I took up a thimble filled with liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of fencers in England.&#160; My nurse gave me a part of a straw, which I exercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth.&#160; I was that day shown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation; for those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people were ready to break down the doors to come in.&#160; My master, for his own interest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse; and to prevent danger, benches were set round the table at such a distance as to put me out of every body&#8217;s reach.&#160; However, an unlucky school-boy aimed a hazel nut directly at my head, which very narrowly missed me; otherwise it came with so much violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out my brains, for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin, but I had the satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the room.</p>
<p>My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next market-day; and in the meantime he prepared a convenient vehicle for me, which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my first journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I could hardly stand upon my legs, or speak a word.&#160; It was at least three days before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at home, all the neighbouring gentlemen from a hundred miles round, hearing of my fame, came to see me at my master&#8217;s own house.&#160; There could not be fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the country is very populous;) and my master demanded the rate of a full room whenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single family; so that for some time I had but little ease every day of the week (except Wednesday, which is their Sabbath,) although I were not carried to the town.</p>
<p>My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to carry me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom.&#160; Having therefore provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th of August, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the metropolis, situate near the middle of that empire, and about three thousand miles distance from our house.&#160; My master made his daughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him.&#160; She carried me on her lap, in a box tied about her waist.&#160; The girl had lined it on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with her baby&#8217;s bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she could.&#160; We had no other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.</p>
<p>My master&#8217;s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or person of quality&#8217;s house, where he might expect custom.&#160; We made easy journeys, of not above seven or eight score miles a-day; for Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the trotting of the horse.&#160; She often took me out of my box, at my own desire, to give me air, and show me the country, but always held me fast by a leading-string.&#160; We passed over five or six rivers, many degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges: and there was hardly a rivulet so small as the Thames at London-bridge.&#160; We were ten weeks in our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many villages, and private families.</p>
<p>On the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in their language <i>Lorbrulgrud</i>, or Pride of the Universe.&#160; My master took a lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the royal palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact description of my person and parts.&#160; He hired a large room between three and four hundred feet wide.&#160; He provided a table sixty feet in diameter, upon which I was to act my part, and pallisadoed it round three feet from the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over.&#160; I was shown ten times a-day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people.&#160; I could now speak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood every word, that was spoken to me.&#160; Besides, I had learnt their alphabet, and could make a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had been my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our journey.&#160; She carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a Sanson&#8217;s Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls, giving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my letters, and interpreted the words.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00015">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author sent for to court.&#160; The queen buys him of his master the farmer, and presents him to the king.&#160; He disputes with his majesty&#8217;s great scholars.&#160; An apartment at court provided for the author.&#160; He is in high favour with the queen.&#160; He stands up for the honour of his own country.&#160; His quarrels with the queen&#8217;s dwarf.</p>
<p>The frequent labours I underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more insatiable he grew.&#160; I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced to a skeleton.&#160; The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could.&#160; While he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a <i>sardral</i>, or gentleman-usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for the diversion of the queen and her ladies.&#160; Some of the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty, behaviour, and good sense.&#160; Her majesty, and those who attended her, were beyond measure delighted with my demeanour.&#160; I fell on my knees, and begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip.&#160; She made me some general questions about my country and my travels, which I answered as distinctly, and in as few words as I could.&#160; She asked, &#8220;whether I could be content to live at court?&#8221;&#160; I bowed down to the board of the table, and humbly answered &#8220;that I was my master&#8217;s slave: but, if I were at my own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her majesty&#8217;s service.&#8221;&#160; She then asked my master, &#8220;whether he was willing to sell me at a good price?&#8221;&#160; He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England.&#160; I then said to the queen, &#8220;since I was now her majesty&#8217;s most humble creature and vassal, I must beg the favour, that Glumdalclitch, who had always tended me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and instructor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer&#8217;s consent, who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor girl herself was not able to hide her joy.&#160; My late master withdrew, bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to which I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.</p>
<p>The queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the apartment, asked me the reason.&#160; I made bold to tell her majesty, &#8220;that I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in his fields: which obligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had made in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for.&#160; That the life I had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times my strength.&#160; That my health was much impaired, by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day; and that, if my master had not thought my life in danger, her majesty would not have got so cheap a bargain.&#160; But as I was out of all fear of being ill-treated under the protection of so great and good an empress, the ornament of nature, the darling of the world, the delight of her subjects, the phoenix of the creation, so I hoped my late master&#8217;s apprehensions would appear to be groundless; for I already found my spirits revive, by the influence of her most august presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and hesitation.&#160; The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch, while she was carrying me to court.</p>
<p>The queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was, however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an animal.&#160; She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was then retired to his cabinet.&#160; His majesty, a prince of much gravity and austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked the queen after a cold manner &#8220;how long it was since she grew fond of a <i>splacnuck</i>?&#8221; for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast in her majesty&#8217;s right hand.&#160; But this princess, who has an infinite deal of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did in a very few words: and Glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and could not endure I should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my arrival at her father&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>The king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk erect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of clock-work (which is in that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some ingenious artist.&#160; But when he heard my voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his astonishment.&#160; He was by no means satisfied with the relation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me sell at a better price.&#160; Upon this imagination, he put several other questions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the language, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer&#8217;s house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.</p>
<p>His majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly waiting, according to the custom in that country.&#160; These gentlemen, after they had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of different opinions concerning me.&#160; They all agreed that I could not be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth.&#160; They observed by my teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly do.&#160; One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I might be an embryo, or abortive birth.&#160; But this opinion was rejected by the other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and that I had lived several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying glass.&#160; They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the queen&#8217;s favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was near thirty feet high.&#160; After much debate, they concluded unanimously, that I was only <i>relplum scalcath</i>, which is interpreted literally <i>lusus natur&#230;</i>; a determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavoured in vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge.</p>
<p>After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.&#160; I applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, &#8220;that I came from a country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion, and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and to find sustenance, as any of his majesty&#8217;s subjects could do here; which I took for a full answer to those gentlemen&#8217;s arguments.&#8221;&#160; To this they only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, &#8220;that the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson.&#8221;&#160; The king, who had a much better understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by good fortune was not yet gone out of town.&#160; Having therefore first examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be true. He desired the queen to order that a particular care should be taken of me; and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue in her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection for each other.&#160; A convenient apartment was provided for her at court: she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.&#160; The queen commanded her own cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon.&#160; This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London bed-chamber.&#160; The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty&#8217;s upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me.&#160; A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.&#160; The room was quilted on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt, when I went in a coach.&#160; I desired a lock for my door, to prevent rats and mice from coming in.&#160; The smith, after several attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have known a larger at the gate of a gentleman&#8217;s house in England.&#160; I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might lose it.&#160; The queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them.&#160; They were after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.</p>
<p>The queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without me.&#160; I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at her left elbow, and a chair to sit on.&#160; Glumdalclitch stood on a stool on the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me.&#160; I had an entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I have seen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as I wanted them, always cleaning them herself.&#160; No person dined with the queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the younger at that time thirteen and a month.&#160; Her majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and her diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed but a weak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous sight.&#160; She would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two twelve-penny loaves.&#160; She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at a draught.&#160; Her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon the handle.&#160; The spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the same proportion.&#160; I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had never till then beheld so terrible a sight.</p>
<p>It is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is their Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes, dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become a great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were placed at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars.&#160; This prince took a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners, religion, laws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him the best account I was able.&#160; His apprehension was so clear, and his judgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations upon all I said.&#160; But I confess, that, after I had been a little too copious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other, after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, &#8220;whether I was a whig or tory?&#8221;&#160; Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed &#8220;how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I dare engage these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a figure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray!&#8221;&#160; And thus he continued on, while my colour came and went several times, with indignation, to hear our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously treated.</p>
<p>But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature thoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no.&#160; For, after having been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people, and observed every object upon which I cast mine eyes to be of proportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from their bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I had then beheld a company of English lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day clothes, acting their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting, and bowing, and prating, to say the truth, I should have been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me.&#160; Neither, indeed, could I forbear smiling at myself, when the queen used to place me upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which both our persons appeared before me in full view together; and there could be nothing more ridiculous than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself dwindled many degrees below my usual size.</p>
<p>Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen&#8217;s dwarf; who being of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily think he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger and look big as he passed by me in the queen&#8217;s antechamber, while I was standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against which I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging him to wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages.&#160; One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her majesty&#8217;s chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was sitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could.&#160; I fell over head and ears, and, if I had not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted presence of mind to assist me.&#160; But my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.&#160; I was put to bed: however, I received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes, which was utterly spoiled.&#160; The dwarf was soundly whipt, and as a farther punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown me: neither was he ever restored to favour; for soon after the queen bestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no more, to my very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what extremities such a malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.</p>
<p>He had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing, although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede.&#160; Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone to the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous figure.&#160; I believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was become of me; for I thought it below me to cry out.&#160; But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not scalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition.&#160; The dwarf, at my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.</p>
<p>I was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards as myself?&#160; The occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered with flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with their continual humming and buzzing about mine ears.&#160; They would sometimes alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement, or spawn behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the natives of that country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine, in viewing smaller objects.&#160; Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or forehead, where they stung me to the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily trace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists tell us, enables those creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling.&#160; I had much ado to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear starting when they came on my face.&#160; It was the common practice of the dwarf, to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten me, and divert the queen.&#160; My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my knife, as they flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.</p>
<p>I remember, one morning, when Glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I durst not venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do with cages in England), after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat down at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming louder than the drones of as many bagpipes.&#160; Some of them seized my cake, and carried it piecemeal away; others flew about my head and face, confounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost terror of their stings.&#160; However, I had the courage to rise and draw my hanger, and attack them in the air.&#160; I dispatched four of them, but the rest got away, and I presently shut my window.&#160; These insects were as large as partridges: I took out their stings, found them an inch and a half long, and as sharp as needles.&#160; I carefully preserved them all; and having since shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts of Europe, upon my return to England I gave three of them to Gresham College, and kept the fourth for myself.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00016">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The country described.&#160; A proposal for correcting modern maps.&#160; The king&#8217;s palace; and some account of the metropolis.&#160; The author&#8217;s way of travelling.&#160; The chief temple described.</p>
<p>I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as far as I travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis.&#160; For the queen, whom I always attended, never went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and there staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers.&#160; The whole extent of this prince&#8217;s dominions reaches about six thousand miles in length, and from three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but conclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the great continent of Tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their maps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west parts of America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.</p>
<p>The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason of the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be inhabited at all.&#160; On the three other sides, it is bounded by the ocean.&#160; There is not one seaport in the whole kingdom: and those parts of the coasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and the sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with the smallest of their boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce with the rest of the world.&#160; But the large rivers are full of vessels, and abound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any from the sea, because the sea fish are of the same size with those in Europe, and consequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest, that nature, in the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this continent, of which I leave the reasons to be determined by philosophers.&#160; However, now and then they take a whale that happens to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on heartily.&#160; These whales I have known so large, that a man could hardly carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes, for curiosity, they are brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud; I saw one of them in a dish at the king&#8217;s table, which passed for a rarity, but I did not observe he was fond of it; for I think, indeed, the bigness disgusted him, although I have seen one somewhat larger in Greenland.</p>
<p>The country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages.&#160; To satisfy my curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud.&#160; This city stands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes through.&#160; It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six hundred thousand inhabitants.&#160; It is in length three <i>glomglungs</i> (which make about fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as I measured it myself in the royal map made by the king&#8217;s order, which was laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and, computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.</p>
<p>The king&#8217;s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty feet high, and broad and long in proportion.&#160; A coach was allowed to Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party, carried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the houses and the people, as we passed along the streets.&#160; I reckoned our coach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not altogether so high: however, I cannot be very exact.&#160; One day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where the beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach, and gave me the most horrible spectacle that ever a European eye beheld.&#160; There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled to a monstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could have easily crept, and covered my whole body.&#160; There was a fellow with a wen in his neck, larger than five wool-packs; and another, with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty feet high.&#160; But the most hateful sight of all, was the lice crawling on their clothes.&#160; I could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much better than those of a European louse through a microscope, and their snouts with which they rooted like swine.&#160; They were the first I had ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough to dissect one of them, if I had had proper instruments, which I unluckily left behind me in the ship, although, indeed, the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.</p>
<p>Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered a smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high, for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat too large for Glumdalclitch&#8217;s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was made by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance.&#160; This travelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys.&#160; On the fourth side, which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the person that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a leathern belt, and buckled it about his waist.&#160; This was always the office of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I soon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose more upon account of their majesties&#8217; favour, than any merit of my own.&#160; In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there I had a full prospect of the country on three sides, from my three windows.&#160; I had, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling, two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach.&#160; And having been long used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.</p>
<p>Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my travelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by two others in the queen&#8217;s livery.&#160; The people, who had often heard of me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand, that I might be more conveniently seen.</p>
<p>I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.&#160; Accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand feet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which, allowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in Europe, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in proportion (if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple.&#160; But, not to detract from a nation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely obliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous tower wants in height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut in marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches.&#160; I measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet and an inch in length.&#160; Glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief, and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.</p>
<p>The king&#8217;s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about six hundred feet high.&#160; The great oven is not so wide, by ten paces, as the cupola at St. Paul&#8217;s: for I measured the latter on purpose, after my return.&#160; But if I should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other particulars, perhaps I should be hardly believed; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as travellers are often suspected to do.&#160; To avoid which censure I fear I have run too much into the other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to be translated into the language of Brobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom,) and transmitted thither, the king and his people would have reason to complain that I had done them an injury, by a false and diminutive representation.</p>
<p>His majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: they are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high.&#160; But, when he goes abroad on solemn days, he is attended, for state, by a military guard of five hundred horse, which, indeed, I thought was the most splendid sight that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in battalia, whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00017">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Several adventurers that happened to the author.&#160; The execution of a criminal.&#160; The author shows his skill in navigation.</p>
<p>I should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of which I shall venture to relate.&#160; Glumdalclitch often carried me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out of it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk.&#160; I remember, before the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and I being close together, near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show my wit, by a silly allusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in their language as it does in ours.&#160; Whereupon, the malicious rogue, watching his opportunity, when I was walking under one of them, shook it directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of them near as large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my face; but I received no other hurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire, because I had given the provocation.</p>
<p>Another day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert myself, while she walked at some distance with her governess.&#160; In the meantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was immediately by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if I had been pelted with tennis-balls; however, I made a shift to creep on all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee-side of a border of lemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot, that I could not go abroad in ten days.&#160; Neither is this at all to be wondered at, because nature, in that country, observing the same proportion through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as large as one in Europe; which I can assert upon experience, having been so curious as to weigh and measure them.</p>
<p>But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when my little nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I often entreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts,) and having left my box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance.&#160; While she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I lay: the dog, following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to his master wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground.&#160; By good fortune he had been so well taught, that I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even tearing my clothes.&#160; But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright: he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me how I did? but I was so amazed and out of breath, that I could not speak a word.&#160; In a few minutes I came to myself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who, by this time, had returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she called.&#160; She severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog.&#160; But the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was afraid of the queen&#8217;s anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would not be for my reputation, that such a story should go about.</p>
<p>This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me abroad for the future out of her sight.&#160; I had been long afraid of this resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky adventures, that happened in those times when I was left by myself.&#160; Once a kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had not resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he would have certainly carried me away in his talons.&#160; Another time, walking to the top of a fresh mole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole, through which that animal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie, not worth remembering, to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes.&#160; I likewise broke my right shin against the shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble over, as I was walking alone and thinking on poor England.</p>
<p>I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in those solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard&#8217;s distance, looking for worms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no creature at all were near them.&#160; I remember, a thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast.&#160; When I attempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my fingers, which I durst not venture within their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did before.&#160; But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.&#160; However, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though I held him at arm&#8217;s-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty times thinking to let him go.&#160; But I was soon relieved by one of our servants, who wrung off the bird&#8217;s neck, and I had him next day for dinner, by the queen&#8217;s command.&#160; This linnet, as near as I can remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan.</p>
<p>The maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments, and desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me.&#160; They would often strip me naked from top to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith I was much disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell came from their skins; which I do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of respect; but I conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness, and that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers, or to each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England.&#160; And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more supportable, than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately swooned away.&#160; I cannot forget, that an intimate friend of mine in Lilliput, took the freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal of exercise, to complain of a strong smell about me, although I am as little faulty that way, as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine was to that of this people.&#160; Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady in England.</p>
<p>That which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my nurse carried me to visit then) was, to see them use me without any manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of consequence: for they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my presence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked bodies, which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight, or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust: their skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously coloured, when I saw them near, with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing farther concerning the rest of their persons.&#160; Neither did they at all scruple, while I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to the quantity of at least two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tuns.&#160; The handsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant, frolicsome girl of sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over particular.&#160; But I was so much displeased, that I entreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more.</p>
<p>One day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse&#8217;s governess, came and pressed them both to see an execution.&#160; It was of a man, who had murdered one of that gentleman&#8217;s intimate acquaintance.&#160; Glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against her inclination, for she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for myself, although I abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see something that I thought must be extraordinary.&#160; The malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose, and his head cut off at one blow, with a sword of about forty feet long.&#160; The veins and arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in the air, that the great <i>jet d&#8217;eau</i> at Versailles was not equal to it for the time it lasted: and the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce as made me start, although I was at least half an English mile distant.</p>
<p>The queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health?&#160; I answered, that I understood both very well: for although my proper employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced to work like a common mariner.&#160; But I could not see how this could be done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage would never live in any of their rivers.&#160; Her majesty said, if I would contrive a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for me to sail in.&#160; The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my instructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its tackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans.&#160; When it was finished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap to the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls, or little oars, for want of room.&#160; But the queen had before contrived another project.&#160; She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer room of the palace.&#160; It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water, when it began to grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour.&#160; Here I often used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and agility.&#160; Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and, when they were weary, some of their pages would blow my sail forward with their breath, while I showed my art by steering starboard or larboard as I pleased.&#160; When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.</p>
<p>In this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to place me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman&#8217;s stomacher; the head of the pin passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.</p>
<p>Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.&#160; The frog lay concealed till I was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent overturning.&#160; When the frog was got in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my head, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious slime.&#160; The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived.&#160; However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone.&#160; I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap out of the boat.</p>
<p>But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.&#160; Glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business, or a visit.&#160; The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.&#160; As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat, although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.&#160; I retreated to the farther corner of my room; or box; but the monkey looking in at every side, put me in such a fright, that I wanted presence of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done.&#160; After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that country silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out.&#160; He took me up in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is going to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a kitten in Europe; and when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to submit.&#160; I have good reason to believe, that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his other paw.&#160; In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening it: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours.&#160; I heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me out.&#160; The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding me like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was ridiculous enough to every body but myself.&#160; Some of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden, or else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.</p>
<p>The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile, and made his escape.&#160; Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse&#8217;s footmen, climbed up, and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.</p>
<p>I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.&#160; Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.&#160; The king, queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness.&#160; The monkey was killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the palace.</p>
<p>When I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for his favours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.&#160; He asked me, &#8220;what my thoughts and speculations were, while I lay in the monkey&#8217;s paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his manner of feeding; and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach.&#8221;&#160; He desired to know, &#8220;what I would have done upon such an occasion in my own country.&#8221;&#160; I told his majesty, &#8220;that in Europe we had no monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosity from other places, and so small, that I could deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack me.&#160; And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make use of my hanger,&#8221; (looking fiercely, and clapping my hand on the hilt, as I spoke) &#8220;when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I should have given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in.&#8221;&#160; This I delivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be called in question.&#160; However, my speech produced nothing else beside a laud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from those about him could not make them contain.&#160; This made me reflect, how vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.&#160; And yet I have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in England since my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.</p>
