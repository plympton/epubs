<p>I had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner, by what methods great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour, and prodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very modern period: however, without grating upon present times, because I would be sure to give no offence even to foreigners (for I hope the reader need not be told, that I do not in the least intend my own country, in what I say upon this occasion,) a great number of persons concerned were called up; and, upon a very slight examination, discovered such a scene of infamy, that I cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness.&#160; Perjury, oppression, subornation, fraud, pandarism, and the like infirmities, were among the most excusable arts they had to mention; and for these I gave, as it was reasonable, great allowance.&#160; But when some confessed they owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy, or incest; others, to the prostituting of their own wives and daughters; others, to the betraying of their country or their prince; some, to poisoning; more to the perverting of justice, in order to destroy the innocent, I hope I may be pardoned, if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that profound veneration, which I am naturally apt to pay to persons of high rank, who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their sublime dignity, by us their inferiors.</p>
<p>I had often read of some great services done to princes and states, and desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed.&#160; Upon inquiry I was told, &#8220;that their names were to be found on no record, except a few of them, whom history has represented as the vilest of rogues and traitors.&#8221;&#160; As to the rest, I had never once heard of them.&#160; They all appeared with dejected looks, and in the meanest habit; most of them telling me, &#8220;they died in poverty and disgrace, and the rest on a scaffold or a gibbet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among others, there was one person, whose case appeared a little singular.&#160; He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side.&#160; He told me, &#8220;he had for many years been commander of a ship; and in the sea fight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy&#8217;s great line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a fourth, which was the sole cause of Antony&#8217;s flight, and of the victory that ensued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was killed in the action.&#8221;&#160; He added, &#8220;that upon the confidence of some merit, the war being at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of Augustus to be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been killed; but, without any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a boy who had never seen the sea, the son of Libertina, who waited on one of the emperor&#8217;s mistresses.&#160; Returning back to his own vessel, he was charged with neglect of duty, and the ship given to a favourite page of Publicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a great distance from Rome, and there ended his life.&#8221;&#160; I was so curious to know the truth of this story, that I desired Agrippa might be called, who was admiral in that fight.&#160; He appeared, and confirmed the whole account: but with much more advantage to the captain, whose modesty had extenuated or concealed a great part of his merit.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that empire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which made me less wonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all kinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole praise, as well as pillage, has been engrossed by the chief commander, who perhaps had the least title to either.</p>
<p>As every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in the world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race of human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past; how the pox, under all its consequences and denominations had altered every lineament of an English countenance; shortened the size of bodies, unbraced the nerves, relaxed the sinews and muscles, introduced a sallow complexion, and rendered the flesh loose and rancid.</p>
<p>I descended so low, as to desire some English yeoman of the old stamp might be summoned to appear; once so famous for the simplicity of their manners, diet, and dress; for justice in their dealings; for their true spirit of liberty; for their valour, and love of their country.&#160; Neither could I be wholly unmoved, after comparing the living with the dead, when I considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a piece of money by their grand-children; who, in selling their votes and managing at elections, have acquired every vice and corruption that can possibly be learned in a court.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00030">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author returns to Maldonada.&#160; Sails to the kingdom of Luggnagg.&#160; The author confined.&#160; He is sent for to court.&#160; The manner of his admittance.&#160; The king&#8217;s great lenity to his subjects.</p>
<p>The day of our departure being come, I took leave of his highness, the Governor of Glubbdubdrib, and returned with my two companions to Maldonada, where, after a fortnight&#8217;s waiting, a ship was ready to sail for Luggnagg.&#160; The two gentlemen, and some others, were so generous and kind as to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board.&#160; I was a month in this voyage.&#160; We had one violent storm, and were under a necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind, which holds for above sixty leagues.&#160; On the 21st of April, 1708, we sailed into the river of Clumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the south-east point of Luggnagg.&#160; We cast anchor within a league of the town, and made a signal for a pilot.&#160; Two of them came on board in less than half an hour, by whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks, which are very dangerous in the passage, to a large basin, where a fleet may ride in safety within a cable&#8217;s length of the town-wall.</p>
<p>Some of our sailors, whether out of treachery or inadvertence, had informed the pilots &#8220;that I was a stranger, and great traveller;&#8221; whereof these gave notice to a custom-house officer, by whom I was examined very strictly upon my landing.&#160; This officer spoke to me in the language of Balnibarbi, which, by the force of much commerce, is generally understood in that town, especially by seamen and those employed in the customs.&#160; I gave him a short account of some particulars, and made my story as plausible and consistent as I could; but I thought it necessary to disguise my country, and call myself a Hollander; because my intentions were for Japan, and I knew the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to enter into that kingdom.&#160; I therefore told the officer, &#8220;that having been shipwrecked on the coast of Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was received up into Laputa, or the flying island (of which he had often heard), and was now endeavouring to get to Japan, whence I might find a convenience of returning to my own country.&#8221;&#160; The officer said, &#8220;I must be confined till he could receive orders from court, for which he would write immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight.&#8221;&#160; I was carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door; however, I had the liberty of a large garden, and was treated with humanity enough, being maintained all the time at the king&#8217;s charge.&#160; I was invited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity, because it was reported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had never heard.</p>
<p>I hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter; he was a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and was a perfect master of both languages.&#160; By his assistance, I was able to hold a conversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted only of their questions, and my answers.</p>
<p>The despatch came from court about the time we expected.&#160; It contained a warrant for conducting me and my retinue to <i>Traldragdubh</i>, or <i>Trildrogdrib</i> (for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can remember), by a party of ten horse.&#160; All my retinue was that poor lad for an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble request, we had each of us a mule to ride on.&#160; A messenger was despatched half a day&#8217;s journey before us, to give the king notice of my approach, and to desire, &#8220;that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour, when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have the honour to lick the dust before his footstool.&#8221;&#160; This is the court style, and I found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the floor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a stranger, care was taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was not offensive.&#160; However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but persons of the highest rank, when they desire an admittance.&#160; Nay, sometimes the floor is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be admitted happens to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the throne; he was not able to speak a word.&#160; Neither is there any remedy; because it is capital for those, who receive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths in his majesty&#8217;s presence.&#160; There is indeed another custom, which I cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to put any of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition, which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours.&#160; But in justice to this prince&#8217;s great clemency, and the care he has of his subjects&#8217; lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of Europe would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well washed after every such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure.&#160; I myself heard him give directions, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but maliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great hopes, coming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the king at that time had no design against his life.&#160; But this good prince was so gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise that he would do so no more, without special orders.</p>
<p>To return from this digression.&#160; When I had crept within four yards of the throne, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my forehead seven times against the ground, I pronounced the following words, as they had been taught me the night before, <i>Inckpling gloffthrobb squut serummblhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkuffh slhiophad gurdlubh asht</i>.&#160; This is the compliment, established by the laws of the land, for all persons admitted to the king&#8217;s presence.&#160; It may be rendered into English thus: &#8220;May your celestial majesty outlive the sun, eleven moons and a half!&#8221;&#160; To this the king returned some answer, which, although I could not understand, yet I replied as I had been directed: <i>Fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush</i>, which properly signifies, &#8220;My tongue is in the mouth of my friend;&#8221; and by this expression was meant, that I desired leave to bring my interpreter; whereupon the young man already mentioned was accordingly introduced, by whose intervention I answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour.&#160; I spoke in the Balnibarbian tongue, and my interpreter delivered my meaning in that of Luggnagg.</p>
<p>The king was much delighted with my company, and ordered his <i>bliffmarklub</i>, or high-chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court for me and my interpreter; with a daily allowance for my table, and a large purse of gold for my common expenses.</p>
<p>I staid three months in this country, out of perfect obedience to his majesty; who was pleased highly to favour me, and made me very honourable offers.&#160; But I thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00031">CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Luggnaggians commended.&#160; A particular description of the Struldbrugs, with many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon that subject.</p>
<p>The Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people; and although they are not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all Eastern countries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers, especially such who are countenanced by the court.&#160; I had many acquaintance, and among persons of the best fashion; and being always attended by my interpreter, the conversation we had was not disagreeable.</p>
<p>One day, in much good company, I was asked by a person of quality, &#8220;whether I had seen any of their <i>struldbrugs</i>, or immortals?&#8221;&#160; I said, &#8220;I had not;&#8221; and desired he would explain to me &#8220;what he meant by such an appellation, applied to a mortal creature.&#8221;&#160; He told me &#8220;that sometimes, though very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family, with a red circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was an infallible mark that it should never die.&#8221;&#160; The spot, as he described it, &#8220;was about the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of time grew larger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it became green, so continued till five and twenty, then turned to a deep blue: at five and forty it grew coal black, and as large as an English shilling; but never admitted any further alteration.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;these births were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs, of both sexes, in the whole kingdom; of which he computed about fifty in the metropolis, and, among the rest, a young girl born; about three years ago: that these productions were not peculiar to any family, but a mere effect of chance; and the children of the <i>struldbrugs</i> themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight, upon hearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to understand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I could not forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little too extravagant.&#160; I cried out, as in a rapture, &#8220;Happy nation, where every child hath at least a chance for being immortal!&#160; Happy people, who enjoy so many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready to instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but happiest, beyond all comparison, are those excellent <i>struldbrugs</i>, who, being born exempt from that universal calamity of human nature, have their minds free and disengaged, without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the continual apprehensions of death!&#8221;&#160; I discovered my admiration that I had not observed any of these illustrious persons at court; the black spot on the forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not have easily overlooked it: and it was impossible that his majesty, a most judicious prince, should not provide himself with a good number of such wise and able counsellors.&#160; Yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court: and we often find by experience, that young men are too opinionated and volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors.&#160; However, since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was resolved, upon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on this matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and whether he would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing I was determined, that his majesty having frequently offered me an establishment in this country, I would, with great thankfulness, accept the favour, and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior beings the <i>struldbrugs</i>, if they would please to admit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have already observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me, with a sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant, &#8220;that he was glad of any occasion to keep me among them, and desired my permission to explain to the company what I had spoke.&#8221;&#160; He did so, and they talked together for some time in their own language, whereof I understood not a syllable, neither could I observe by their countenances, what impression my discourse had made on them.&#160; After a short silence, the same person told me, &#8220;that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express himself) were very much pleased with the judicious remarks I had made on the great happiness and advantages of immortal life, and they were desirous to know, in a particular manner, what scheme of living I should have formed to myself, if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a <i>struldbrug</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered, &#8220;it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a subject, especially to me, who had been often apt to amuse myself with visions of what I should do, if I were a king, a general, or a great lord: and upon this very case, I had frequently run over the whole system how I should employ myself, and pass the time, if I were sure to live for ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;That, if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a <i>struldbrug</i>, as soon as I could discover my own happiness, by understanding the difference between life and death, I would first resolve, by all arts and methods, whatsoever, to procure myself riches.&#160; In the pursuit of which, by thrift and management, I might reasonably expect, in about two hundred years, to be the wealthiest man in the kingdom.&#160; In the second place, I would, from my earliest youth, apply myself to the study of arts and sciences, by which I should arrive in time to excel all others in learning.&#160; Lastly, I would carefully record every action and event of consequence, that happened in the public, impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and great ministers of state, with my own observations on every point.&#160; I would exactly set down the several changes in customs, language, fashions of dress, diet, and diversions.&#160; By all which acquirements, I should be a living treasure of knowledge and wisdom, and certainly become the oracle of the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable manner, yet still on the saving side.&#160; I would entertain myself in forming and directing the minds of hopeful young men, by convincing them, from my own remembrance, experience, and observation, fortified by numerous examples, of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life.&#160; But my choice and constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood; among whom, I would elect a dozen from the most ancient, down to my own contemporaries.&#160; Where any of these wanted fortunes, I would provide them with convenient lodges round my own estate, and have some of them always at my table; only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals, whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance, and treat your posterity after the same manner; just as a man diverts himself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden, without regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year.</p>
<p>&#8220;These <i>struldbrugs</i> and I would mutually communicate our observations and memorials, through the course of time; remark the several gradations by which corruption steals into the world, and oppose it in every step, by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind; which, added to the strong influence of our own example, would probably prevent that continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Add to this, the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states and empires; the changes in the lower and upper world; ancient cities in ruins, and obscure villages become the seats of kings; famous rivers lessening into shallow brooks; the ocean leaving one coast dry, and overwhelming another; the discovery of many countries yet unknown; barbarity overrunning the politest nations, and the most barbarous become civilized.&#160; I should then see the discovery of the longitude, the perpetual motion, the universal medicine, and many other great inventions, brought to the utmost perfection.</p>
<p>&#8220;What wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy, by outliving and confirming our own predictions; by observing the progress and return of comets, with the changes of motion in the sun, moon, and stars!&#8221;</p>
<p>I enlarged upon many other topics, which the natural desire of endless life, and sublunary happiness, could easily furnish me with.&#160; When I had ended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted, as before, to the rest of the company, there was a good deal of talk among them in the language of the country, not without some laughter at my expense.&#160; At last, the same gentleman who had been my interpreter, said, &#8220;he was desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes, which I had fallen into through the common imbecility of human nature, and upon that allowance was less answerable for them.&#160; That this breed of <i>struldbrugs</i> was peculiar to their country, for there were no such people either in Balnibarbi or Japan, where he had the honour to be ambassador from his majesty, and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to believe that the fact was possible: and it appeared from my astonishment when he first mentioned the matter to me, that I received it as a thing wholly new, and scarcely to be credited.&#160; That in the two kingdoms above mentioned, where, during his residence, he had conversed very much, he observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind.&#160; That whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as strongly as he could.&#160; That the oldest had still hopes of living one day longer, and looked on death as the greatest evil, from which nature always prompted him to retreat.&#160; Only in this island of Luggnagg the appetite for living was not so eager, from the continual example of the <i>struldbrugs</i> before their eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That the system of living contrived by me, was unreasonable and unjust; because it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and vigour, which no man could be so foolish to hope, however extravagant he may be in his wishes.&#160; That the question therefore was not, whether a man would choose to be always in the prime of youth, attended with prosperity and health; but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages which old age brings along with it.&#160; For although few men will avow their desires of being immortal, upon such hard conditions, yet in the two kingdoms before mentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed that every man desired to put off death some time longer, let it approach ever so late: and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly, except he were incited by the extremity of grief or torture.&#160; And he appealed to me, whether in those countries I had travelled, as well as my own, I had not observed the same general disposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this preface, he gave me a particular account of the <i>struldbrugs</i> among them.&#160; He said, &#8220;they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty years old; after which, by degrees, they grew melancholy and dejected, increasing in both till they came to fourscore.&#160; This he learned from their own confession: for otherwise, there not being above two or three of that species born in an age, they were too few to form a general observation by.&#160; When they came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the extremity of living in this country, they had not only all the follies and infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the dreadful prospect of never dying.&#160; They were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of friendship, and dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their grandchildren.&#160; Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions.&#160; But those objects against which their envy seems principally directed, are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old.&#160; By reflecting on the former, they find themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they themselves never can hope to arrive.&#160; They have no remembrance of anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and middle-age, and even that is very imperfect; and for the truth or particulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than upon their best recollections.&#160; The least miserable among them appear to be those who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet with more pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities which abound in others.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a <i>struldbrug</i> happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage is dissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the younger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it a reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any fault of their own, to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their misery doubled by the load of a wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as they have completed the term of eighty years, they are looked on as dead in law; their heirs immediately succeed to their estates; only a small pittance is reserved for their support; and the poor ones are maintained at the public charge.&#160; After that period, they are held incapable of any employment of trust or profit; they cannot purchase lands, or take leases; neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any cause, either civil or criminal, not even for the decision of meers and bounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;At ninety, they lose their teeth and hair; they have at that age no distinction of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without relish or appetite.&#160; The diseases they were subject to still continue, without increasing or diminishing.&#160; In talking, they forget the common appellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are their nearest friends and relations.&#160; For the same reason, they never can amuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve to carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and by this defect, they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might otherwise be capable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The language of this country being always upon the flux, the <i>struldbrugs</i> of one age do not understand those of another; neither are they able, after two hundred years, to hold any conversation (farther than by a few general words) with their neighbours the mortals; and thus they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own country.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the account given me of the <i>struldbrugs</i>, as near as I can remember.&#160; I afterwards saw five or six of different ages, the youngest not above two hundred years old, who were brought to me at several times by some of my friends; but although they were told, &#8220;that I was a great traveller, and had seen all the world,&#8221; they had not the least curiosity to ask me a question; only desired &#8220;I would give them <i>slumskudask</i>,&#8221; or a token of remembrance; which is a modest way of begging, to avoid the law, that strictly forbids it, because they are provided for by the public, although indeed with a very scanty allowance.</p>
<p>They are despised and hated by all sorts of people.&#160; When one of them is born, it is reckoned ominous, and their birth is recorded very particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register, which, however, has not been kept above a thousand years past, or at least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances.&#160; But the usual way of computing how old they are, is by asking them what kings or great persons they can remember, and then consulting history; for infallibly the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were fourscore years old.</p>
<p>They were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld; and the women more horrible than the men.&#160; Besides the usual deformities in extreme old age, they acquired an additional ghastliness, in proportion to their number of years, which is not to be described; and among half a dozen, I soon distinguished which was the eldest, although there was not above a century or two between them.</p>
<p>The reader will easily believe, that from what I had hear and seen, my keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated.&#160; I grew heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed; and thought no tyrant could invent a death into which I would not run with pleasure, from such a life.&#160; The king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends upon this occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing I could send a couple of <i>struldbrugs</i> to my own country, to arm our people against the fear of death; but this, it seems, is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the kingdom, or else I should have been well content with the trouble and expense of transporting them.</p>
<p>I could not but agree, that the laws of this kingdom relative to the <i>struldbrugs</i> were founded upon the strongest reasons, and such as any other country would be under the necessity of enacting, in the like circumstances.&#160; Otherwise, as avarice is the necessary consequence of old age, those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole nation, and engross the civil power, which, for want of abilities to manage, must end in the ruin of the public.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00032">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author leaves Luggnagg, and sails to Japan.&#160; From thence he returns in a Dutch ship to Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam to England.</p>
<p>I thought this account of the <i>struldbrugs</i> might be some entertainment to the reader, because it seems to be a little out of the common way; at least I do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that has come to my hands: and if I am deceived, my excuse must be, that it is necessary for travellers who describe the same country, very often to agree in dwelling on the same particulars, without deserving the censure of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them.</p>
<p>There is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great empire of Japan; and it is very probable, that the Japanese authors may have given some account of the <i>struldbrugs</i>; but my stay in Japan was so short, and I was so entirely a stranger to the language, that I was not qualified to make any inquiries.&#160; But I hope the Dutch, upon this notice, will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.</p>
<p>His majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his court, and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native country, was pleased to give me his license to depart; and honoured me with a letter of recommendation, under his own hand, to the Emperor of Japan.&#160; He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large pieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers), and a red diamond, which I sold in England for eleven hundred pounds.</p>
<p>On the 6th of May, 1709, I took a solemn leave of his majesty, and all my friends.&#160; This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct me to Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the south-west part of the island.&#160; In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me to Japan, and spent fifteen days in the voyage.&#160; We landed at a small port-town called Xamoschi, situated on the south-east part of Japan; the town lies on the western point, where there is a narrow strait leading northward into along arm of the sea, upon the north-west part of which, Yedo, the metropolis, stands.&#160; At landing, I showed the custom-house officers my letter from the king of Luggnagg to his imperial majesty.&#160; They knew the seal perfectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand.&#160; The impression was, <i>A king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth</i>.&#160; The magistrates of the town, hearing of my letter, received me as a public minister.&#160; They provided me with carriages and servants, and bore my charges to Yedo; where I was admitted to an audience, and delivered my letter, which was opened with great ceremony, and explained to the Emperor by an interpreter, who then gave me notice, by his majesty&#8217;s order, &#8220;that I should signify my request, and, whatever it were, it should be granted, for the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg.&#8221;&#160; This interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the Hollanders.&#160; He soon conjectured, by my countenance, that I was a European, and therefore repeated his majesty&#8217;s commands in Low Dutch, which he spoke perfectly well.&#160; I answered, as I had before determined, &#8220;that I was a Dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country, whence I had travelled by sea and land to Luggnagg, and then took shipping for Japan; where I knew my countrymen often traded, and with some of these I hoped to get an opportunity of returning into Europe: I therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour, to give order that I should be conducted in safety to Nangasac.&#8221;&#160; To this I added another petition, &#8220;that for the sake of my patron the king of Luggnagg, his majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on my countrymen, of trampling upon the crucifix: because I had been thrown into his kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading.&#8221;&#160; When this latter petition was interpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a little surprised; and said, &#8220;he believed I was the first of my countrymen who ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt, whether I was a real Hollander, or not; but rather suspected I must be a Christian.&#160; However, for the reasons I had offered, but chiefly to gratify the king of Luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour, he would comply with the singularity of my humour; but the affair must be managed with dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let me pass, as it were by forgetfulness.&#160; For he assured me, that if the secret should be discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the voyage.&#8221;&#160; I returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a favour; and some troops being at that time on their march to Nangasac, the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither, with particular instructions about the business of the crucifix.</p>
<p>On the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long and troublesome journey.&#160; I soon fell into the company of some Dutch sailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons.&#160; I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke Dutch well.&#160; The seamen soon knew whence I came last: they were curious to inquire into my voyages and course of life.&#160; I made up a story as short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part.&#160; I knew many persons in Holland.&#160; I was able to invent names for my parents, whom I pretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland.&#160; I would have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask for my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was contented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve him in the way of my calling.&#160; Before we took shipping, I was often asked by some of the crew, whether I had performed the ceremony above mentioned?&#160; I evaded the question by general answers; &#8220;that I had satisfied the Emperor and court in all particulars.&#8221;&#160; However, a malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer, and pointing to me, told him, &#8220;I had not yet trampled on the crucifix;&#8221; but the other, who had received instructions to let me pass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on the shoulders with a bamboo; after which I was no more troubled with such questions.</p>
<p>Nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage.&#160; We sailed with a fair wind to the Cape of Good Hope, where we staid only to take in fresh water.&#160; On the 10th of April, 1710, we arrived safe at Amsterdam, having lost only three men by sickness in the voyage, and a fourth, who fell from the foremast into the sea, not far from the coast of Guinea.&#160; From Amsterdam I soon after set sail for England, in a small vessel belonging to that city.</p>
<p>On the 16th of April we put in at the Downs.&#160; I landed next morning, and saw once more my native country, after an absence of five years and six months complete.&#160; I went straight to Redriff, where I arrived the same day at two in the afternoon, and found my wife and family in good health.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00033">PART IV.&#160; A VOYAGE TO THE COUNTRY OF THE HOUYHNHNMS.</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00034">CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author sets out as captain of a ship.&#160; His men conspire against him, confine him a long time to his cabin, and set him on shore in an unknown land.&#160; He travels up into the country.&#160; The Yahoos, a strange sort of animal, described.&#160; The author meets two Houyhnhnms.</p>
<p>I continued at home with my wife and children about five months, in a very happy condition, if I could have learned the lesson of knowing when I was well.&#160; I left my poor wife big with child, and accepted an advantageous offer made me to be captain of the Adventurer, a stout merchantman of 350 tons: for I understood navigation well, and being grown weary of a surgeon&#8217;s employment at sea, which, however, I could exercise upon occasion, I took a skilful young man of that calling, one Robert Purefoy, into my ship.&#160; We set sail from Portsmouth upon the 7th day of September, 1710; on the 14th we met with Captain Pocock, of Bristol, at Teneriffe, who was going to the bay of Campechy to cut logwood.&#160; On the 16th, he was parted from us by a storm; I heard since my return, that his ship foundered, and none escaped but one cabin boy.&#160; He was an honest man, and a good sailor, but a little too positive in his own opinions, which was the cause of his destruction, as it has been with several others; for if he had followed my advice, he might have been safe at home with his family at this time, as well as myself.</p>
<p>I had several men who died in my ship of calentures, so that I was forced to get recruits out of Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, where I touched, by the direction of the merchants who employed me; which I had soon too much cause to repent: for I found afterwards, that most of them had been buccaneers.&#160; I had fifty hands onboard; and my orders were, that I should trade with the Indians in the South-Sea, and make what discoveries I could.&#160; These rogues, whom I had picked up, debauched my other men, and they all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship, and secure me; which they did one morning, rushing into my cabin, and binding me hand and foot, threatening to throw me overboard, if I offered to stir.&#160; I told them, &#8220;I was their prisoner, and would submit.&#8221;&#160; This they made me swear to do, and then they unbound me, only fastening one of my legs with a chain, near my bed, and placed a sentry at my door with his piece charged, who was commanded to shoot me dead if I attempted my liberty.&#160; They sent me own victuals and drink, and took the government of the ship to themselves.&#160; Their design was to turn pirates and, plunder the Spaniards, which they could not do till they got more men.&#160; But first they resolved to sell the goods the ship, and then go to Madagascar for recruits, several among them having died since my confinement.&#160; They sailed many weeks, and traded with the Indians; but I knew not what course they took, being kept a close prisoner in my cabin, and expecting nothing less than to be murdered, as they often threatened me.</p>
<p>Upon the 9th day of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my cabin, and said, &#8220;he had orders from the captain to set me ashore.&#8221;&#160; I expostulated with him, but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me who their new captain was.&#160; They forced me into the long-boat, letting me put on my best suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take a small bundle of linen, but no arms, except my hanger; and they were so civil as not to search my pockets, into which I conveyed what money I had, with some other little necessaries.&#160; They rowed about a league, and then set me down on a strand.&#160; I desired them to tell me what country it was.&#160; They all swore, &#8220;they knew no more than myself;&#8221; but said, &#8220;that the captain&#8221; (as they called him) &#8220;was resolved, after they had sold the lading, to get rid of me in the first place where they could discover land.&#8221;&#160; They pushed off immediately, advising me to make haste for fear of being overtaken by the tide, and so bade me farewell.</p>
<p>In this desolate condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon firm ground, where I sat down on a bank to rest myself, and consider what I had best do.&#160; When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the country, resolving to deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and purchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other toys, which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages, and whereof I had some about me.&#160; The land was divided by long rows of trees, not regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was great plenty of grass, and several fields of oats.&#160; I walked very circumspectly, for fear of being surprised, or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind, or on either side.&#160; I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracts of human feet, and some of cows, but most of horses.&#160; At last I beheld several animals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees.&#160; Their shape was very singular and deformed, which a little discomposed me, so that I lay down behind a thicket to observe them better.&#160; Some of them coming forward near the place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of distinctly marking their form.&#160; Their heads and breasts were covered with a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats, and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see their skins, which were of a brown buff colour.&#160; They had no tails, nor any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus, which, I presume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the ground, for this posture they used, as well as lying down, and often stood on their hind feet.&#160; They climbed high trees as nimbly as a squirrel, for they had strong extended claws before and behind, terminating in sharp points, and hooked.&#160; They would often spring, and bound, and leap, with prodigious agility.&#160; The females were not so large as the males; they had long lank hair on their heads, but none on their faces, nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their bodies, except about the anus and pudenda.&#160; The dugs hung between their fore feet, and often reached almost to the ground as they walked.&#160; The hair of both sexes was of several colours, brown, red, black, and yellow.&#160; Upon the whole, I never beheld, in all my travels, so disagreeable an animal, or one against which I naturally conceived so strong an antipathy.&#160; So that, thinking I had seen enough, full of contempt and aversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct me to the cabin of some Indian.&#160; I had not got far, when I met one of these creatures full in my way, and coming up directly to me.&#160; The ugly monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways, every feature of his visage, and stared, as at an object he had never seen before; then approaching nearer, lifted up his fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or mischief I could not tell; but I drew my hanger, and gave him a good blow with the flat side of it, for I durst not strike with the edge, fearing the inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know that I had killed or maimed any of their cattle.&#160; When the beast felt the smart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty came flocking about me from the next field, howling and making odious faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it, kept them off by waving my hanger.&#160; Several of this cursed brood, getting hold of the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began to discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with the filth, which fell about me on every side.</p>
<p>In the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a sudden as fast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and pursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this fright.&#160; But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in the field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of their flight.&#160; The horse started a little, when he came near me, but soon recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times.&#160; I would have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the way, yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least violence.&#160; We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took the boldness to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going to handle a strange horse.&#160; But this animal seemed to receive my civilities with disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right fore-foot to remove my hand.&#160; Then he neighed three or four times, but in so different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to himself, in some language of his own.</p>
<p>While he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying himself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each other&#8217;s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying the sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.&#160; They went some paces off, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backward and forward, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but often turning their eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might not escape.&#160; I was amazed to see such actions and behaviour in brute beasts; and concluded with myself, that if the inhabitants of this country were endued with a proportionable degree of reason, they must needs be the wisest people upon earth.&#160; This thought gave me so much comfort, that I resolved to go forward, until I could discover some house or village, or meet with any of the natives, leaving the two horses to discourse together as they pleased.&#160; But the first, who was a dapple gray, observing me to steal off, neighed after me in so expressive a tone, that I fancied myself to understand what he meant; whereupon I turned back, and came near to him to expect his farther commands: but concealing my fear as much as I could, for I began to be in some pain how this adventure might terminate; and the reader will easily believe I did not much like my present situation.</p>
<p>The two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon my face and hands.&#160; The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust it better by taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and his companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised: the latter felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about me, they both looked with new signs of wonder.&#160; He stroked my right hand, seeming to admire the softness and colour; but he squeezed it so hard between his hoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; after which they both touched me with all possible tenderness.&#160; They were under great perplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt very often, neighing to each other, and using various gestures, not unlike those of a philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult phenomenon.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and rational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must needs be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some design, and seeing a stranger in the way, resolved to divert themselves with him; or, perhaps, were really amazed at the sight of a man so very different in habit, feature, and complexion, from those who might probably live in so remote a climate.&#160; Upon the strength of this reasoning, I ventured to address them in the following manner: &#8220;Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you can understand my language; therefore I make bold to let your worships know that I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes upon your coast; and I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved.&#160; In return of which favour, I will make you a present of this knife and bracelet,&#8221; taking them out of my pocket.&#160; The two creatures stood silent while I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and when I had ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were engaged in serious conversation.&#160; I plainly observed that their language expressed the passions very well, and the words might, with little pains, be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the Chinese.</p>
<p>I could frequently distinguish the word <i>Yahoo</i>, which was repeated by each of them several times: and although it was impossible for me to conjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in conversation, I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue; and as soon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced <i>Yahoo</i> in a loud voice, imitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of a horse; at which they were both visibly surprised; and the gray repeated the same word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right accent; wherein I spoke after him as well as I could, and found myself perceivably to improve every time, though very far from any degree of perfection.&#160; Then the bay tried me with a second word, much harder to be pronounced; but reducing it to the English orthography, may be spelt thus, <i>Houyhnhnm</i>.&#160; I did not succeed in this so well as in the former; but after two or three farther trials, I had better fortune; and they both appeared amazed at my capacity.</p>
<p>After some further discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to me, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of striking each other&#8217;s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should walk before him; wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could find a better director.&#160; When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry <i>hhuun hhuun</i>: I guessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as well as I could, &#8220;that I was weary, and not able to walk faster;&#8221; upon which he would stand awhile to let me rest.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00035">CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author conducted by a Houyhnhnm to his house.&#160; The house described.&#160; The author&#8217;s reception.&#160; The food of the Houyhnhnms.&#160; The author in distress for want of meat.&#160; Is at last relieved.&#160; His manner of feeding in this country.</p>
<p>Having travelled about three miles, we came to a long kind of building, made of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was low and covered with straw.&#160; I now began to be a little comforted; and took out some toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage Indians of America, and other parts, in hopes the people of the house would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly.&#160; The horse made me a sign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor, and a rack and manger, extending the whole length on one side.&#160; There were three nags and two mares, not eating, but some of them sitting down upon their hams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more to see the rest employed in domestic business; these seemed but ordinary cattle.&#160; However, this confirmed my first opinion, that a people who could so far civilise brute animals, must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the world.&#160; The gray came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill treatment which the others might have given me.&#160; He neighed to them several times in a style of authority, and received answers.</p>
<p>Beyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the house, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other, in the manner of a vista.&#160; We went through the second room towards the third.&#160; Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend: I waited in the second room, and got ready my presents for the master and mistress of the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false pearls, a small looking-glass, and a bead necklace.&#160; The horse neighed three or four times, and I waited to hear some answers in a human voice, but I heard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one or two a little shriller than his.&#160; I began to think that this house must belong to some person of great note among them, because there appeared so much ceremony before I could gain admittance.&#160; But, that a man of quality should be served all by horses, was beyond my comprehension.&#160; I feared my brain was disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes.&#160; I roused myself, and looked about me in the room where I was left alone: this was furnished like the first, only after a more elegant manner.&#160; I rubbed my eyes often, but the same objects still occurred.&#160; I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself, hoping I might be in a dream.&#160; I then absolutely concluded, that all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic.&#160; But I had no time to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to the door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where I saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches upon mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and clean.</p>
<p>The mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close, after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most contemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard the word <i>Yahoo</i> often repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then comprehend, although it was the first I had learned to pronounce.&#160; But I was soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the horse, beckoning to me with his head, and repeating the <i>hhuun</i>, <i>hhuun</i>, as he did upon the road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into a kind of court, where was another building, at some distance from the house.&#160; Here we entered, and I saw three of those detestable creatures, which I first met after my landing, feeding upon roots, and the flesh of some animals, which I afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs, and now and then a cow, dead by accident or disease.&#160; They were all tied by the neck with strong withes fastened to a beam; they held their food between the claws of their fore feet, and tore it with their teeth.</p>
<p>The master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie the largest of these animals, and take him into the yard.&#160; The beast and I were brought close together, and by our countenances diligently compared both by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several times the word <i>Yahoo</i>.&#160; My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I observed in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure: the face of it indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed, the lips large, and the mouth wide; but these differences are common to all savage nations, where the lineaments of the countenance are distorted, by the natives suffering their infants to lie grovelling on the earth, or by carrying them on their backs, nuzzling with their face against the mothers&#8217; shoulders.&#160; The fore-feet of the <i>Yahoo</i> differed from my hands in nothing else but the length of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and the hairiness on the backs.&#160; There was the same resemblance between our feet, with the same differences; which I knew very well, though the horses did not, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour, which I have already described.</p>
<p>The great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see the rest of my body so very different from that of a <i>Yahoo</i>, for which I was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception.&#160; The sorrel nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we shall describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I took it in my hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as I could.&#160; He brought out of the <i>Yahoos</i>&#8217; kennel a piece of ass&#8217;s flesh; but it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with loathing: he then threw it to the <i>Yahoo</i>, by whom it was greedily devoured.&#160; He afterwards showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of oats; but I shook my head, to signify that neither of these were food for me.&#160; And indeed I now apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if I did not get to some of my own species; for as to those filthy <i>Yahoos</i>, although there were few greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself, yet I confess I never saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and the more I came near them the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in that country.&#160; This the master horse observed by my behaviour, and therefore sent the <i>Yahoo</i> back to his kennel.&#160; He then put his fore-hoof to his mouth, at which I was much surprised, although he did it with ease, and with a motion that appeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to know what I would eat; but I could not return him such an answer as he was able to apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how it was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment.&#160; While we were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to her, and expressed a desire to go and milk her.&#160; This had its effect; for he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a room, where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after a very orderly and cleanly manner.&#160; She gave me a large bowlful, of which I drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.</p>
<p>About noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a sledge by four <i>Yahoos</i>.&#160; There was in it an old steed, who seemed to be of quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by accident got a hurt in his left fore-foot.&#160; He came to dine with our horse, who received him with great civility.&#160; They dined in the best room, and had oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old horse ate warm, but the rest cold.&#160; Their mangers were placed circular in the middle of the room, and divided into several partitions, round which they sat on their haunches, upon bosses of straw.&#160; In the middle was a large rack, with angles answering to every partition of the manger; so that each horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk, with much decency and regularity.&#160; The behaviour of the young colt and foal appeared very modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely cheerful and complaisant to their guest.&#160; The gray ordered me to stand by him; and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me, as I found by the stranger&#8217;s often looking on me, and the frequent repetition of the word <i>Yahoo</i>.</p>
<p>I happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed perplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my fore-feet.&#160; He put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify, that I should reduce them to their former shape, which I presently did, pulling off both my gloves, and putting them into my pocket.&#160; This occasioned farther talk; and I saw the company was pleased with my behaviour, whereof I soon found the good effects.&#160; I was ordered to speak the few words I understood; and while they were at dinner, the master taught me the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and some others, which I could readily pronounce after him, having from my youth a great facility in learning languages.</p>
<p>When dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and words made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to eat.&#160; Oats in their tongue are called <i>hlunnh</i>.&#160; This word I pronounced two or three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon second thoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a kind of bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of my own species.&#160; The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray.&#160; These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain.&#160; I ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and made them into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk.&#160; It was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough in many parts of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often reduced to hard fare in my life, this was not the first experiment I had made how easily nature is satisfied.&#160; And I cannot but observe, that I never had one hours sickness while I stayed in this island.&#160; It is true, I sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or bird, by springs made of <i>Yahoo&#8217;s</i> hairs; and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled, and ate as salads with my bread; and now and then, for a rarity, I made a little butter, and drank the whey.&#160; I was at first at a great loss for salt, but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it; and I am confident that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was first introduced only as a provocative to drink, except where it is necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages, or in places remote from great markets; for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man, and as to myself, when I left this country, it was a great while before I could endure the taste of it in anything that I ate.</p>
<p>This is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other travellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally concerned whether we fare well or ill.&#160; However, it was necessary to mention this matter, lest the world should think it impossible that I could find sustenance for three years in such a country, and among such inhabitants.</p>
<p>When it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me to lodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separated from the stable of the <i>Yahoos</i>.&#160; Here I got some straw, and covering myself with my own clothes, slept very sound.&#160; But I was in a short time better accommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when I come to treat more particularly about my way of living.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00036">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author studies to learn the language.&#160; The Houyhnhnm, his master, assists in teaching him.&#160; The language described.&#160; Several Houyhnhnms of quality come out of curiosity to see the author.&#160; He gives his master a short account of his voyage.</p>
<p>My principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for so I shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every servant of his house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy, that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature.&#160; I pointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which I wrote down in my journal-book when I was alone, and corrected my bad accent by desiring those of the family to pronounce it often.&#160; In this employment, a sorrel nag, one of the under-servants, was very ready to assist me.</p>
<p>In speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their language approaches nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I know in Europe; but is much more graceful and significant.&#160; The emperor Charles V. made almost the same observation, when he said &#8220;that if he were to speak to his horse, it should be in High-Dutch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he spent many hours of his leisure to instruct me.&#160; He was convinced (as he afterwards told me) that I must be a <i>Yahoo</i>; but my teachableness, civility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities altogether opposite to those animals.&#160; He was most perplexed about my clothes, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a part of my body: for I never pulled them off till the family were asleep, and got them on before they waked in the morning.&#160; My master was eager to learn &#8220;whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason, which I discovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth, which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in learning and pronouncing their words and sentences.&#8221;&#160; To help my memory, I formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words down, with the translations.&#160; This last, after some time, I ventured to do in my master&#8217;s presence.&#160; It cost me much trouble to explain to him what I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or literature.</p>
<p>In about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his questions; and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.&#160; He was extremely curious to know &#8220;from what part of the country I came, and how I was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the <i>Yahoos</i> (whom he saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face, that were only visible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition to mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.&#8221;&#160; I answered, &#8220;that I came over the sea, from a far place, with many others of my own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees: that my companions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to shift for myself.&#8221;&#160; It was with some difficulty, and by the help of many signs, that I brought him to understand me.&#160; He replied, &#8220;that I must needs be mistaken, or that I said the thing which was not;&#8221; for they have no word in their language to express lying or falsehood.&#160; &#8220;He knew it was impossible that there could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel of brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water.&#160; He was sure no <i>Houyhnhnm</i> alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust <i>Yahoos</i> to manage it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The word <i>Houyhnhnm</i>, in their tongue, signifies a <i>horse</i>, and, in its etymology, the <i>perfection of nature</i>.&#160; I told my master, &#8220;that I was at a loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped, in a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.&#8221;&#160; He was pleased to direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the family, to take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for two or three hours, he was at the same pains himself.&#160; Several horses and mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon the report spread of &#8220;a wonderful <i>Yahoo</i>, that could speak like a <i>Houyhnhnm</i>, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some glimmerings of reason.&#8221;&#160; These delighted to converse with me: they put many questions, and received such answers as I was able to return.&#160; By all these advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months from my arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express myself tolerably well.</p>
<p>The <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right <i>Yahoo</i>, because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.&#160; They were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on my head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master upon an accident which happened about a fortnight before.</p>
<p>I have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes.&#160; It happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by the sorrel nag, who was his valet.&#160; When he came I was fast asleep, my clothes fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist.&#160; I awaked at the noise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder; after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very confused account of what he had seen.&#160; This I presently discovered, for, going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he asked me &#8220;the meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to be at other times; that his vale assured him, some part of me was white, some yellow, at least not so white, and some brown.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to distinguish myself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of <i>Yahoos</i>; but now I found it in vain to do so any longer.&#160; Besides, I considered that my clothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining condition, and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of <i>Yahoos</i>, or other brutes; whereby the whole secret would be known.&#160; I therefore told my master, &#8220;that in the country whence I came, those of my kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals prepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air, both hot and cold; of which, as to my own person, I would give him immediate conviction, if he pleased to command me: only desiring his excuse, if I did not expose those parts that nature taught us to conceal.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;my discourse was all very strange, but especially the last part; for he could not understand, why nature should teach us to conceal what nature had given; that neither himself nor family were ashamed of any parts of their bodies; but, however, I might do as I pleased.&#8221;&#160; Whereupon I first unbuttoned my coat, and pulled it off.&#160; I did the same with my waistcoat.&#160; I drew off my shoes, stockings, and breeches.&#160; I let my shirt down to my waist, and drew up the bottom; fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my nakedness.</p>
<p>My master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity and admiration.&#160; He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body very gently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said, it was plain I must be a perfect <i>Yahoo</i>; but that I differed very much from the rest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin; my want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and shortness of my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking continually on my two hinder feet.&#160; He desired to see no more; and gave me leave to put on my clothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.</p>
<p>I expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of <i>Yahoo</i>, an odious animal, for which I had so utter a hatred and contempt: I begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and make the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to see me.&#160; I requested likewise, &#8220;that the secret of my having a false covering to my body, might be known to none but himself, at least as long as my present clothing should last; for as to what the sorrel nag, his valet, had observed, his honour might command him to conceal it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this my master very graciously consented to; and thus the secret was kept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to supply by several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned.&#160; In the meantime, he desired &#8220;I would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their language, because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and reason, than at the figure of my body, whether it were covered or not;&#8221; adding, &#8220;that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which I promised to tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me: he brought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility; &#8220;because,&#8221; as he told them, privately, &#8220;this would put me into good humour, and make me more diverting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every day, when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in teaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I answered as well as I could, and by these means he had already received some general ideas, though very imperfect.&#160; It would be tedious to relate the several steps by which I advanced to a more regular conversation; but the first account I gave of myself in any order and length was to this purpose:</p>
<p>&#8220;That I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to tell him, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travelled upon the seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honour&#8217;s house.&#160; I described the ship to him in the best terms I could, and explained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it was driven forward by the wind.&#160; That upon a quarrel among us, I was set on shore on this coast, where I walked forward, without knowing whither, till he delivered me from the persecution of those execrable <i>Yahoos</i>.&#8221;&#160; He asked me, &#8220;who made the ship, and how it was possible that the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> of my country would leave it to the management of brutes?&#8221;&#160; My answer was, &#8220;that I durst proceed no further in my relation, unless he would give me his word and honour that he would not be offended, and then I would tell him the wonders I had so often promised.&#8221;&#160; He agreed; and I went on by assuring him, that the ship was made by creatures like myself; who, in all the countries I had travelled, as well as in my own, were the only governing rational animals; and that upon my arrival hither, I was as much astonished to see the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> act like rational beings, as he, or his friends, could be, in finding some marks of reason in a creature he was pleased to call a <i>Yahoo</i>; to which I owned my resemblance in every part, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature.&#160; I said farther, &#8220;that if good fortune ever restored me to my native country, to relate my travels hither, as I resolved to do, everybody would believe, that I said the thing that was not, that I invented the story out of my own head; and (with all possible respect to himself, his family, and friends, and under his promise of not being offended) our countrymen would hardly think it probable that a <i>Houyhnhnm</i> should be the presiding creature of a nation, and a <i>Yahoo</i> the brute.&#8221;</p>
