<p>I desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor; and to let him know, &#8220;that I thought it would not become me, who was a foreigner, to interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the hazard of my life, to defend his person and state against all invaders.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00008">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author, by an extraordinary stratagem, prevents an invasion.&#160; A high title of honour is conferred upon him.&#160; Ambassadors arrive from the emperor of Blefuscu, and sue for peace.&#160; The empress&#8217;s apartment on fire by an accident; the author instrumental in saving the rest of the palace.</p>
<p>The empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the north-east of Lilliput, from which it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred yards wide.&#160; I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended invasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of being discovered, by some of the enemy&#8217;s ships, who had received no intelligence of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been strictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever.&#160; I communicated to his majesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy&#8217;s whole fleet; which, as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbour, ready to sail with the first fair wind.&#160; I consulted the most experienced seamen upon the depth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told me, that in the middle, at high-water, it was seventy <i>glumgluffs</i> deep, which is about six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty <i>glumgluffs</i> at most.&#160; I walked towards the north-east coast, over against Blefuscu, where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small perspective glass, and viewed the enemy&#8217;s fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty men of war, and a great number of transports: I then came back to my house, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron.&#160; The cable was about as thick as packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle.&#160; I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted three of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook.&#160; Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the north-east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea, in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high water.&#160; I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about thirty yards, till I felt ground.&#160; I arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour.&#160; The enemy was so frightened when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand souls.&#160; I then took my tackling, and, fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords together at the end.&#160; While I was thus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face, and, beside the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work.&#160; My greatest apprehension was for mine eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient.&#160; I kept, among other little necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I observed before, had escaped the emperor&#8217;s searchers.&#160; These I took out and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on boldly with my work, in spite of the enemy&#8217;s arrows, many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect, further than a little to discompose them.&#160; I had now fastened all the hooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained.&#160; I therefore let go the cord, and leaving the looks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred shots in my face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables, to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy&#8217;s largest men of war after me.</p>
<p>The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended, were at first confounded with astonishment.&#160; They had seen me cut the cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of grief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceive.&#160; When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face; and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned.&#160; I then took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the royal port of Lilliput.</p>
<p>The emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting the issue of this great adventure.&#160; They saw the ships move forward in a large half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.&#160; When I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in pain, because I was under water to my neck.&#160; The emperor concluded me to be drowned, and that the enemy&#8217;s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner: but he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud voice, &#8220;Long live the most puissant king of Lilliput!&#8221;&#160; This great prince received me at my landing with all possible encomiums, and created me a <i>nardac</i> upon the spot, which is the highest title of honour among them.</p>
<p>His majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all the rest of his enemy&#8217;s ships into his ports.&#160; And so unmeasureable is the ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than reducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it, by a viceroy; of destroying the Big-endian exiles, and compelling that people to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain the sole monarch of the whole world.&#160; But I endeavoured to divert him from this design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as well as justice; and I plainly protested, &#8220;that I would never be an instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.&#8221;&#160; And, when the matter was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my opinion.</p>
<p>This open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and politics of his imperial majesty, that he could never forgive me.&#160; He mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told that some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some expressions which, by a side-wind, reflected on me.&#160; And from this time began an intrigue between his majesty and a junto of ministers, maliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months, and had like to have ended in my utter destruction.&#160; Of so little weight are the greatest services to princes, when put into the balance with a refusal to gratify their passions.</p>
<p>About three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy from Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace, which was soon concluded, upon conditions very advantageous to our emperor, wherewith I shall not trouble the reader.&#160; There were six ambassadors, with a train of about five hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to the grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business.&#160; When their treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices by the credit I now had, or at least appeared to have, at court, their excellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend, made me a visit in form.&#160; They began with many compliments upon my valour and generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their master&#8217;s name, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength, of which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily obliged them, but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.</p>
<p>When I had for some time entertained their excellencies, to their infinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the honour to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master, the renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with admiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend, before I returned to my own country.&#160; Accordingly, the next time I had the honour to see our emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the Blefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could perceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the reason, till I had a whisper from a certain person, &#8220;that Flimnap and Bolgolam had represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of disaffection;&#8221; from which I am sure my heart was wholly free.&#160; And this was the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and ministers.</p>
<p>It is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me, by an interpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each other as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the antiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongue, with an avowed contempt for that of their neighbour; yet our emperor, standing upon the advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to deliver their credentials, and make their speech, in the Lilliputian tongue.&#160; And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of trade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of exiles which is mutual among them, and from the custom, in each empire, to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in order to polish themselves by seeing the world, and understanding men and manners; there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or seamen, who dwell in the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation in both tongues; as I found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to the emperor of Blefuscu, which, in the midst of great misfortunes, through the malice of my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in its proper place.</p>
<p>The reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I recovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked, upon account of their being too servile; neither could anything but an extreme necessity have forced me to submit.&#160; But being now a <i>nardac</i> of the highest rank in that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and the emperor (to do him justice), never once mentioned them to me.&#160; However, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his majesty, at least as I then thought, a most signal service.&#160; I was alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door; by which, being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror.&#160; I heard the word <i>Burglum</i> repeated incessantly: several of the emperor&#8217;s court, making their way through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to the palace, where her imperial majesty&#8217;s apartment was on fire, by the carelessness of a maid of honour, who fell asleep while she was reading a romance.&#160; I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the way before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get to the palace without trampling on any of the people.&#160; I found they had already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and were well provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance.&#160; These buckets were about the size of large thimbles, and the poor people supplied me with them as fast as they could: but the flame was so violent that they did little good.&#160; I might easily have stifled it with my coat, which I unfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in my leathern jerkin.&#160; The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable; and this magnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground, if, by a presence of mind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an expedient.&#160; I had, the evening before, drunk plentifully of a most delicious wine called <i>glimigrim</i>, (the Blefuscudians call it <i>flunec</i>, but ours is esteemed the better sort,) which is very diuretic.&#160; By the luckiest chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of it.&#160; The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by labouring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate by urine; which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places, that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from destruction.</p>
<p>It was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to congratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever, to make water within the precincts of the palace.&#160; But I was a little comforted by a message from his majesty, &#8220;that he would give orders to the grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form:&#8221; which, however, I could not obtain; and I was privately assured, &#8220;that the empress, conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the most distant side of the court, firmly resolved that those buildings should never be repaired for her use: and, in the presence of her chief confidents could not forbear vowing revenge.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00009">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Of the inhabitants of Lilliput; their learning, laws, and customs; the manner of educating their children.&#160; The author&#8217;s way of living in that country.&#160; His vindication of a great lady.</p>
<p>Although I intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular treatise, yet, in the mean time, I am content to gratify the curious reader with some general ideas.&#160; As the common size of the natives is somewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact proportion in all other animals, as well as plants and trees: for instance, the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches in height, the sheep an inch and half, more or less: their geese about the bigness of a sparrow, and so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallest, which to my sight, were almost invisible; but nature has adapted the eyes of the Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view: they see with great exactness, but at no great distance.&#160; And, to show the sharpness of their sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased with observing a cook pulling a lark, which was not so large as a common fly; and a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk.&#160; Their tallest trees are about seven feet high: I mean some of those in the great royal park, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my fist clenched.&#160; The other vegetables are in the same proportion; but this I leave to the reader&#8217;s imagination.</p>
<p>I shall say but little at present of their learning, which, for many ages, has flourished in all its branches among them: but their manner of writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the right, like the Europeans, nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians, nor from up to down, like the Chinese, but aslant, from one corner of the paper to the other, like ladies in England.</p>
<p>They bury their dead with their heads directly downward, because they hold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise again; in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection, be found ready standing on their feet.&#160; The learned among them confess the absurdity of this doctrine; but the practice still continues, in compliance to the vulgar.</p>
<p>There are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if they were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, I should be tempted to say a little in their justification.&#160; It is only to be wished they were as well executed.&#160; The first I shall mention, relates to informers.&#160; All crimes against the state, are punished here with the utmost severity; but, if the person accused makes his innocence plainly to appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an ignominious death; and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he underwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for all the charges he has been at in making his defence; or, if that fund be deficient, it is largely supplied by the crown.&#160; The emperor also confers on him some public mark of his favour, and proclamation is made of his innocence through the whole city.</p>
<p>They look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a man&#8217;s goods from thieves, but honesty has no defence against superior cunning; and, since it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying and selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted and connived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest dealer is always undone, and the knave gets the advantage.&#160; I remember, when I was once interceding with the emperor for a criminal who had wronged his master of a great sum of money, which he had received by order and ran away with; and happening to tell his majesty, by way of extenuation, that it was only a breach of trust, the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer as a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime; and truly I had little to say in return, farther than the common answer, that different nations had different customs; for, I confess, I was heartily ashamed. <a id="citation330"></a><a href="gullivers-travelsinto-several-remote-nations-of-the-world-7.html#footnote330" class="citation dlinternal">[330]</a></p>
<p>Although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which all government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be put in practice by any nation except that of Lilliput.&#160; Whoever can there bring sufficient proof, that he has strictly observed the laws of his country for seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain privileges, according to his quality or condition of life, with a proportionable sum of money out of a fund appropriated for that use: he likewise acquires the title of <i>snilpall</i>, or legal, which is added to his name, but does not descend to his posterity.&#160; And these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy among us, when I told them that our laws were enforced only by penalties, without any mention of reward.&#160; It is upon this account that the image of Justice, in their courts of judicature, is formed with six eyes, two before, as many behind, and on each side one, to signify circumspection; with a bag of gold open in her right hand, and a sword sheathed in her left, to show she is more disposed to reward than to punish.</p>
<p>In choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to good morals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to mankind, they believe, that the common size of human understanding is fitted to some station or other; and that Providence never intended to make the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended only by a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born in an age: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to be in every man&#8217;s power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by experience and a good intention, would qualify any man for the service of his country, except where a course of study is required.&#160; But they thought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by superior endowments of the mind, that employments could never be put into such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and, at least, that the mistakes committed by ignorance, in a virtuous disposition, would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the practices of a man, whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and who had great abilities to manage, to multiply, and defend his corruptions.</p>
<p>In like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man incapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow themselves to be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think nothing can be more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority under which he acts.</p>
<p>In relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood to mean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous corruptions, into which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man.&#160; For, as to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing on the ropes, or badges of favour and distinction by leaping over sticks and creeping under them, the reader is to observe, that they were first introduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning, and grew to the present height by the gradual increase of party and faction.</p>
<p>Ingratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have been in some other countries: for they reason thus; that whoever makes ill returns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of mankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and therefore such a man is not fit to live.</p>
<p>Their notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ extremely from ours.&#160; For, since the conjunction of male and female is founded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and continue the species, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are joined together, like other animals, by the motives of concupiscence; and that their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural principle: for which reason they will never allow that a child is under any obligation to his father for begetting him, or to his mother for bringing him into the world; which, considering the miseries of human life, was neither a benefit in itself, nor intended so by his parents, whose thoughts, in their love encounters, were otherwise employed.&#160; Upon these, and the like reasonings, their opinion is, that parents are the last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own children; and therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where all parents, except cottagers and labourers, are obliged to send their infants of both sexes to be reared and educated, when they come to the age of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some rudiments of docility.&#160; These schools are of several kinds, suited to different qualities, and both sexes.&#160; They have certain professors well skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the rank of their parents, and their own capacities, as well as inclinations.&#160; I shall first say something of the male nurseries, and then of the female.</p>
<p>The nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth, are provided with grave and learned professors, and their several deputies.&#160; The clothes and food of the children are plain and simple.&#160; They are bred up in the principles of honour, justice, courage, modesty, clemency, religion, and love of their country; they are always employed in some business, except in the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and two hours for diversions consisting of bodily exercises.&#160; They are dressed by men till four years of age, and then are obliged to dress themselves, although their quality be ever so great; and the women attendant, who are aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial offices.&#160; They are never suffered to converse with servants, but go together in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions, and always in the presence of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice, to which our children are subject.&#160; Their parents are suffered to see them only twice a year; the visit is to last but an hour; they are allowed to kiss the child at meeting and parting; but a professor, who always stands by on those occasions, will not suffer them to whisper, or use any fondling expressions, or bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like.</p>
<p>The pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a child, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the emperor&#8217;s officers.</p>
<p>The nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants, traders, and handicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same manner; only those designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old, whereas those of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteen, which answers to twenty-one with us: but the confinement is gradually lessened for the last three years.</p>
<p>In the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated much like the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own sex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy, till they come to dress themselves, which is at five years old.&#160; And if it be found that these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or foolish stories, or the common follies practised by chambermaids among us, they are publicly whipped thrice about the city, imprisoned for a year, and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country.&#160; Thus the young ladies are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools as the men, and despise all personal ornaments, beyond decency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any difference in their education made by their difference of sex, only that the exercises of the females were not altogether so robust; and that some rules were given them relating to domestic life, and a smaller compass of learning was enjoined them: for their maxim is, that among peoples of quality, a wife should be always a reasonable and agreeable companion, because she cannot always be young.&#160; When the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the marriageable age, their parents or guardians take them home, with great expressions of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of the young lady and her companions.</p>
<p>In the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their several degrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years old, the rest are kept to eleven.</p>
<p>The meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are obliged, besides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to return to the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings, to be a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are limited in their expenses by the law.&#160; For the Lilliputians think nothing can be more unjust, than for people, in subservience to their own appetites, to bring children into the world, and leave the burthen of supporting them on the public.&#160; As to persons of quality, they give security to appropriate a certain sum for each child, suitable to their condition; and these funds are always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justice.</p>
<p>The cottagers and labourers keep their children at home, their business being only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their education is of little consequence to the public: but the old and diseased among them, are supported by hospitals; for begging is a trade unknown in this empire.</p>
<p>And here it may, perhaps, divert the curious reader, to give some account of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a residence of nine months, and thirteen days.&#160; Having a head mechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal park.&#160; Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn.&#160; Their linen is usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece.&#160; The sempstresses took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch long.&#160; Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me exactly.&#160; Three hundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my measure.&#160; I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat: but my waist and arms I measured myself.&#160; When my clothes were finished, which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England, only that mine were all of a colour.</p>
<p>I had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient huts built about my house, where they and their families lived, and prepared me two dishes a-piece.&#160; I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and placed them on the table: a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on their shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up, as I wanted, in a very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we draw the bucket up a well in Europe.&#160; A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught.&#160; Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent.&#160; I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been forced to make three bites of it; but this is rare.&#160; My servants were astonished to see me eat it, bones and all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark.&#160; Their geese and turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and I confess they far exceed ours.&#160; Of their smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at the end of my knife.</p>
<p>One day his imperial majesty, being informed of my way of living, desired &#8220;that himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of the blood of both sexes, might have the happiness,&#8221; as he was pleased to call it, &#8220;of dining with me.&#8221;&#160; They came accordingly, and I placed them in chairs of state, upon my table, just over against me, with their guards about them.&#160; Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise with his white staff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour countenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual, in honour to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with admiration.&#160; I have some private reasons to believe, that this visit from his majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his master.&#160; That minister had always been my secret enemy, though he outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his nature.&#160; He represented to the emperor &#8220;the low condition of his treasury; that he was forced to take up money at a great discount; that exchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent. below par; that I had cost his majesty above a million and a half of <i>sprugs</i>&#8221; (their greatest gold coin, about the bigness of a spangle) &#8220;and, upon the whole, that it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasion of dismissing me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who was an innocent sufferer upon my account.&#160; The treasurer took a fancy to be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who informed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person; and the court scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to my lodging.&#160; This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood, without any grounds, further than that her grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship.&#160; I own she came often to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the court.&#160; And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time saw a coach at my door, without knowing what persons were in it.&#160; On those occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go immediately to the door, and, after paying my respects, to take up the coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for, if there were six horses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and place them on a table, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of five inches high, to prevent accidents.&#160; And I have often had four coaches and horses at once on my table, full of company, while I sat in my chair, leaning my face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen would gently drive the others round my table.&#160; I have passed many an afternoon very agreeably in these conversations.&#160; But I defy the treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make the best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me <i>incognito</i>, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express command of his imperial majesty, as I have before related.&#160; I should not have dwelt so long upon this particular, if it had not been a point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to say nothing of my own; though I then had the honour to be a <i>nardac</i>, which the treasurer himself is not; for all the world knows, that he is only a <i>glumglum</i>, a title inferior by one degree, as that of a marquis is to a duke in England; yet I allow he preceded me in right of his post.&#160; These false informations, which I afterwards came to the knowledge of by an accident not proper to mention, made the treasurer show his lady for some time an ill countenance, and me a worse; and although he was at last undeceived and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and found my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself, who was, indeed, too much governed by that favourite.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00010">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author, being informed of a design to accuse him of high-treason, makes his escape to Blefuscu.&#160; His reception there.</p>
<p>Before I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may be proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two months forming against me.</p>
<p>I had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts, for which I was unqualified by the meanness of my condition.&#160; I had indeed heard and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers, but never expected to have found such terrible effects of them, in so remote a country, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims from those in Europe.</p>
<p>When I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of Blefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very serviceable, at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his imperial majesty) came to my house very privately at night, in a close chair, and, without sending his name, desired admittance.&#160; The chairmen were dismissed; I put the chair, with his lordship in it, into my coat-pocket: and, giving orders to a trusty servant, to say I was indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed the chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by it.&#160; After the common salutations were over, observing his lordship&#8217;s countenance full of concern, and inquiring into the reason, he desired &#8220;I would hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my honour and my life.&#8221;&#160; His speech was to the following effect, for I took notes of it as soon as he left me:&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that several committees of council have been lately called, in the most private manner, on your account; and it is but two days since his majesty came to a full resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam&#8221; (<i>galbet</i>, or high-admiral) &#8220;has been your mortal enemy, almost ever since your arrival.&#160; His original reasons I know not; but his hatred is increased since your great success against Blefuscu, by which his glory as admiral is much obscured.&#160; This lord, in conjunction with Flimnap the high-treasurer, whose enmity against you is notorious on account of his lady, Limtoc the general, Lalcon the chamberlain, and Balmuff the grand justiciary, have prepared articles of impeachment against you, for treason and other capital crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>This preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits and innocence, that I was going to interrupt him; when he entreated me to be silent, and thus proceeded:&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of gratitude for the favours you have done me, I procured information of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles; wherein I venture my head for your service.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Articles of Impeachment against</i> QUINBUS FLESTRIN, (<i>the Man-Mountain</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whereas, by a statute made in the reign of his imperial majesty Calin Deffar Plune, it is enacted, that, whoever shall make water within the precincts of the royal palace, shall be liable to the pains and penalties of high-treason; notwithstanding, the said Quinbus Flestrin, in open breach of the said law, under colour of extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his majesty&#8217;s most dear imperial consort, did maliciously, traitorously, and devilishly, by discharge of his urine, put out the said fire kindled in the said apartment, lying and being within the precincts of the said royal palace, against the statute in that case provided, etc. against the duty, etc.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> II.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That the said Quinbus Flestrin, having brought the imperial fleet of Blefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards commanded by his imperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire of Blefuscu, and reduce that empire to a province, to be governed by a viceroy from hence, and to destroy and put to death, not only all the Big-endian exiles, but likewise all the people of that empire who would not immediately forsake the Big-endian heresy, he, the said Flestrin, like a false traitor against his most auspicious, serene, imperial majesty, did petition to be excused from the said service, upon pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences, or destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent people.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> III.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That, whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the Court of Blefuscu, to sue for peace in his majesty&#8217;s court, he, the said Flestrin, did, like a false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert, the said ambassadors, although he knew them to be servants to a prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty, and in an open war against his said majesty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> IV.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a faithful subject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire of Blefuscu, for which he has received only verbal license from his imperial majesty; and, under colour of the said license, does falsely and traitorously intend to take the said voyage, and thereby to aid, comfort, and abet the emperor of Blefuscu, so lately an enemy, and in open war with his imperial majesty aforesaid.&#8217;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There are some other articles; but these are the most important, of which I have read you an abstract.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be confessed that his majesty gave many marks of his great lenity; often urging the services you had done him, and endeavouring to extenuate your crimes.&#160; The treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most painful and ignominious death, by setting fire to your house at night, and the general was to attend with twenty thousand men, armed with poisoned arrows, to shoot you on the face and hands.&#160; Some of your servants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your shirts and sheets, which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and die in the utmost torture.&#160; The general came into the same opinion; so that for a long time there was a majority against you; but his majesty resolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last brought off the chamberlain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, who always approved himself your true friend, was commanded by the emperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and therein justified the good thoughts you have of him.&#160; He allowed your crimes to be great, but that still there was room for mercy, the most commendable virtue in a prince, and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated.&#160; He said, the friendship between you and him was so well known to the world, that perhaps the most honourable board might think him partial; however, in obedience to the command he had received, he would freely offer his sentiments.&#160; That if his majesty, in consideration of your services, and pursuant to his own merciful disposition, would please to spare your life, and only give orders to put out both your eyes, he humbly conceived, that by this expedient justice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor, as well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour to be his counsellors.&#160; That the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to your bodily strength, by which you might still be useful to his majesty; that blindness is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers from us; that the fear you had for your eyes, was the greatest difficulty in bringing over the enemy&#8217;s fleet, and it would be sufficient for you to see by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest princes do no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;This proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole board.&#160; Bolgolam, the admiral, could not preserve his temper, but, rising up in fury, said, he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give his opinion for preserving the life of a traitor; that the services you had performed were, by all true reasons of state, the great aggravation of your crimes; that you, who were able to extinguish the fire by discharge of urine in her majesty&#8217;s apartment (which he mentioned with horror), might, at another time, raise an inundation by the same means, to drown the whole palace; and the same strength which enabled you to bring over the enemy&#8217;s fleet, might serve, upon the first discontent, to carry it back; that he had good reasons to think you were a Big-endian in your heart; and, as treason begins in the heart, before it appears in overt-acts, so he accused you as a traitor on that account, and therefore insisted you should be put to death.</p>
<p>&#8220;The treasurer was of the same opinion: he showed to what straits his majesty&#8217;s revenue was reduced, by the charge of maintaining you, which would soon grow insupportable; that the secretary&#8217;s expedient of putting out your eyes, was so far from being a remedy against this evil, that it would probably increase it, as is manifest from the common practice of blinding some kind of fowls, after which they fed the faster, and grew sooner fat; that his sacred majesty and the council, who are your judges, were, in their own consciences, fully convinced of your guilt, which was a sufficient argument to condemn you to death, without the formal proofs required by the strict letter of the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;But his imperial majesty, fully determined against capital punishment, was graciously pleased to say, that since the council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a censure, some other way may be inflicted hereafter.&#160; And your friend the secretary, humbly desiring to be heard again, in answer to what the treasurer had objected, concerning the great charge his majesty was at in maintaining you, said, that his excellency, who had the sole disposal of the emperor&#8217;s revenue, might easily provide against that evil, by gradually lessening your establishment; by which, for want of sufficient for you would grow weak and faint, and lose your appetite, and consequently, decay, and consume in a few months; neither would the stench of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should become more than half diminished; and immediately upon your death five or six thousand of his majesty&#8217;s subjects might, in two or three days, cut your flesh from your bones, take it away by cart-loads, and bury it in distant parts, to prevent infection, leaving the skeleton as a monument of admiration to posterity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus, by the great friendship of the secretary, the whole affair was compromised.&#160; It was strictly enjoined, that the project of starving you by degrees should be kept a secret; but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the books; none dissenting, except Bolgolam the admiral, who, being a creature of the empress, was perpetually instigated by her majesty to insist upon your death, she having borne perpetual malice against you, on account of that infamous and illegal method you took to extinguish the fire in her apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;In three days your friend the secretary will be directed to come to your house, and read before you the articles of impeachment; and then to signify the great lenity and favour of his majesty and council, whereby you are only condemned to the loss of your eyes, which his majesty does not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to; and twenty of his majesty&#8217;s surgeons will attend, in order to see the operation well performed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into the balls of your eyes, as you lie on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I leave to your prudence what measures you will take; and to avoid suspicion, I must immediately return in as private a manner as I came.&#8221;</p>
<p>His lordship did so; and I remained alone, under many doubts and perplexities of mind.</p>
<p>It was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very different, as I have been assured, from the practice of former times,) that after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to gratify the monarch&#8217;s resentment, or the malice of a favourite, the emperor always made a speech to his whole council, expressing his great lenity and tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all the world.&#160; This speech was immediately published throughout the kingdom; nor did any thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty&#8217;s mercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent.&#160; Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never been designed for a courtier, either by my birth or education, I was so ill a judge of things, that I could not discover the lenity and favour of this sentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous than gentle.&#160; I sometimes thought of standing my trial, for, although I could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped they would admit of some extenuation.&#160; But having in my life perused many state-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought fit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so critical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies.&#160; Once I was strongly bent upon resistance, for, while I had liberty the whole strength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project with horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the emperor, the favours I received from him, and the high title of <i>nardac</i> he conferred upon me.&#160; Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers, to persuade myself, that his majesty&#8217;s present seventies acquitted me of all past obligations.</p>
<p>At last, I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may incur some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the preserving of mine eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want of experience; because, if I had then known the nature of princes and ministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should, with great alacrity and readiness, have submitted to so easy a punishment.&#160; But hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial majesty&#8217;s license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I took this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a letter to my friend the secretary, signifying my resolution of setting out that morning for Blefuscu, pursuant to the leave I had got; and, without waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where our fleet lay.&#160; I seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow, and, lifting up the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together with my coverlet, which I carried under my arm) into the vessel, and, drawing it after me, between wading and swimming arrived at the royal port of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me: they lent me two guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name.&#160; I held them in my hands, till I came within two hundred yards of the gate, and desired them &#8220;to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and let him know, I there waited his majesty&#8217;s command.&#8221;&#160; I had an answer in about an hour, &#8220;that his majesty, attended by the royal family, and great officers of the court, was coming out to receive me.&#8221;&#160; I advanced a hundred yards.&#160; The emperor and his train alighted from their horses, the empress and ladies from their coaches, and I did not perceive they were in any fright or concern.&#160; I lay on the ground to kiss his majesty&#8217;s and the empress&#8217;s hands.&#160; I told his majesty, &#8220;that I was come according to my promise, and with the license of the emperor my master, to have the honour of seeing so mighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my power, consistent with my duty to my own prince;&#8221; not mentioning a word of my disgrace, because I had hitherto no regular information of it, and might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I reasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret, while I was out of his power; wherein, however, it soon appeared I was deceived.</p>
<p>I shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my reception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so great a prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house and bed, being forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00011">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author, by a lucky accident, finds means to leave Blefuscu; and, after some difficulties, returns safe to his native country.</p>
<p>Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north-east coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea, somewhat that looked like a boat overturned.&#160; I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, I found the object to approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship.&#160; Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and desired his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the command of his vice-admiral.&#160; This fleet sailed round, while I went back the shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat.&#160; I found the tide had driven it still nearer.&#160; The seamen were all provided with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength.&#160; When the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a hundred yards off the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it.&#160; The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a hole in the fore-part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but I found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I was not able to work.&#160; In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and push the boat forward, as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the tide favouring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin and feel the ground.&#160; I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the boat another shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my arm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being over, I took out my other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the wind being favourable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived within forty yards of the shore; and, waiting till the tide was out, I got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it was but little damaged.</p>
<p>I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under, by the help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people appeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel.&#160; I told the emperor &#8220;that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way, to carry me to some place whence I might return into my native country; and begged his majesty&#8217;s orders for getting materials to fit it up, together with his license to depart;&#8221; which, after some kind expostulations, he was pleased to grant.</p>
<p>I did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any express relating to me from our emperor to the court of Blefuscu.&#160; But I was afterward given privately to understand, that his imperial majesty, never imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was only gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the license he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would return in a few days, when the ceremony was ended.&#160; But he was at last in pain at my long absence; and after consulting with the treasurer and the rest of that cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of the articles against me.&#160; This envoy had instructions to represent to the monarch of Blefuscu, &#8220;the great lenity of his master, who was content to punish me no farther than with the loss of mine eyes; that I had fled from justice; and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived of my title of <i>nardac</i>, and declared a traitor.&#8221;&#160; The envoy further added, &#8220;that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both empires, his master expected that his brother of Blefuscu would give orders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be punished as a traitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an answer consisting of many civilities and excuses.&#160; He said, &#8220;that as for sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that, although I had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace.&#160; That, however, both their majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction; and he hoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so insupportable an encumbrance.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput; and the monarch of Blefuscu related to me all that had passed; offering me at the same time (but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection, if I would continue in his service; wherein, although I believed him sincere, yet I resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgments for his favourable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused.&#160; I told him, &#8220;that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my way, I was resolved to venture myself on the ocean, rather than be an occasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs.&#8221;&#160; Neither did I find the emperor at all displeased; and I discovered, by a certain accident, that he was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of his ministers.</p>
<p>These considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily contributed.&#160; Five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds of their strongest linen together.&#160; I was at the pains of making ropes and cables, by twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest and strongest of theirs.&#160; A great stone that I happened to find, after a long search, by the sea-shore, served me for an anchor.&#160; I had the tallow of three hundred cows, for greasing my boat, and other uses.&#160; I was at incredible pains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees, for oars and masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted by his majesty&#8217;s ship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them, after I had done the rough work.</p>
<p>In about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty&#8217;s commands, and to take my leave.&#160; The emperor and royal family came out of the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very graciously gave me: so did the empress and young princes of the blood.&#160; His majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred <i>sprugs</i> a-piece, together with his picture at full length, which I put immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt.&#160; The ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at this time.</p>
<p>I stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three hundred sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready dressed as four hundred cooks could provide.&#160; I took with me six cows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into my own country, and propagate the breed.&#160; And to feed them on board, I had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn.&#160; I would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the emperor would by no means permit; and, besides a diligent search into my pockets, his majesty engaged my honour &#8220;not to carry away any of his subjects, although with their own consent and desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on the twenty-fourth day of September 1701, at six in the morning; and when I had gone about four-leagues to the northward, the wind being at south-east, at six in the evening I descried a small island, about half a league to the north-west.&#160; I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the lee-side of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited.&#160; I then took some refreshment, and went to my rest.&#160; I slept well, and as I conjectured at least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked.&#160; It was a clear night.&#160; I ate my breakfast before the sun was up; and heaving anchor, the wind being favourable, I steered the same course that I had done the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket compass.&#160; My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands which I had reason to believe lay to the north-east of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land.&#160; I discovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the afternoon, when I had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the south-east; my course was due east.&#160; I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slackened.&#160; I made all the sail I could, and in half an hour she spied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun.&#160; It is not easy to express the joy I was in, upon the unexpected hope of once more seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I left in it.&#160; The ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in the evening, September 26th; but my heart leaped within me to see her English colours.&#160; I put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets, and got on board with all my little cargo of provisions.&#160; The vessel was an English merchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South seas; the captain, Mr. John Biddel, of Deptford, a very civil man, and an excellent sailor.</p>
<p>We were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty men in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter Williams, who gave me a good character to the captain.&#160; This gentleman treated me with kindness, and desired I would let him know what place I came from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in a few words, but he thought I was raving, and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed my head; whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity.&#160; I then showed him the gold given me by the emperor of Blefuscu, together with his majesty&#8217;s picture at full length, and some other rarities of that country.&#160; I gave him two purses of two hundreds <i>sprugs</i> each, and promised, when we arrived in England, to make him a present of a cow and a sheep big with young.</p>
<p>I shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage, which was very prosperous for the most part.&#160; We arrived in the Downs on the 13th of April, 1702.&#160; I had only one misfortune, that the rats on board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked clean from the flesh.&#160; The rest of my cattle I got safe ashore, and set them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared the contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a voyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit, which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their constant food.&#160; The short time I continued in England, I made a considerable profit by showing my cattle to many persons of quality and others: and before I began my second voyage, I sold them for six hundred pounds.&#160; Since my last return I find the breed is considerably increased, especially the sheep, which I hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.</p>
<p>I stayed but two months with my wife and family, for my insatiable desire of seeing foreign countries, would suffer me to continue no longer.&#160; I left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a good house at Redriff.&#160; My remaining stock I carried with me, part in money and part in goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes.&#160; My eldest uncle John had left me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty pounds a-year; and I had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter-Lane, which yielded me as much more; so that I was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the parish.&#160; My son Johnny, named so after his uncle, was at the grammar-school, and a towardly child.&#160; My daughter Betty (who is now well married, and has children) was then at her needle-work.&#160; I took leave of my wife, and boy and girl, with tears on both sides, and went on board the Adventure, a merchant ship of three hundred tons, bound for Surat, captain John Nicholas, of Liverpool, commander.&#160; But my account of this voyage must be referred to the Second Part of my Travels.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">A great storm described; the long boat sent to fetch water; the author goes with it to discover the country.&#160; He is left on shore, is seized by one of the natives, and carried to a farmer&#8217;s house.&#160; His reception, with several accidents that happened there.&#160; A description of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>Having been condemned, by nature and fortune, to active and restless life, in two months after my return, I again left my native country, and took shipping in the Downs, on the 20th day of June, 1702, in the Adventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornish man, commander, bound for Surat.&#160; We had a very prosperous gale, till we arrived at the Cape of Good Hope, where we landed for fresh water; but discovering a leak, we unshipped our goods and wintered there; for the captain falling sick of an ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March.&#160; We then set sail, and had a good voyage till we passed the Straits of Madagascar; but having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south latitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed to blow a constant equal gale between the north and west, from the beginning of December to the beginning of May, on the 19th of April began to blow with much greater violence, and more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty days together: during which time, we were driven a little to the east of the Molucca Islands, and about three degrees northward of the line, as our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of May, at which time the wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little rejoiced.&#160; But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly happened the day following: for the southern wind, called the southern monsoon, began to set in.</p>
<p>Finding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns were all fast, and handed the mizen.&#160; The ship lay very broad off, so we thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling.&#160; We reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm was hard a-weather.&#160; The ship wore bravely.&#160; We belayed the fore down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it.&#160; It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous.&#160; We hauled off upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped the man at the helm.&#160; We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we had sea-room.&#160; When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail, and brought the ship to.&#160; Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail.&#160; Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at south-west.&#160; We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie.</p>
<p>During this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west, we were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the east, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of the world we were.&#160; Our provisions held out well, our ship was staunch, and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for water.&#160; We thought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn more northerly, which might have brought us to the north-west part of Great Tartary, and into the Frozen Sea.</p>
<p>On the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top-mast discovered land.&#160; On the 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we knew not whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above one hundred tons.&#160; We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long-boat, with vessels for water, if any could be found.&#160; I desired his leave to go with them, that I might see the country, and make what discoveries I could.&#160; When we came to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of inhabitants.&#160; Our men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the sea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I observed the country all barren and rocky.&#160; I now began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned gently down towards the creek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing for life to the ship.&#160; I was going to holla after them, although it had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge creature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had the start of him half a league, and, the sea thereabouts being full of sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.&#160; This I was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the issue of the adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and then climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country.&#160; I found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the length of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high.</p>
<p>I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley.&#160; Here I walked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet.&#160; I was an hour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could make no computation of their altitude.&#160; There was a stile to pass from this field into the next.&#160; It had four steps, and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost.&#160; It was impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about twenty.&#160; I was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our boat.&#160; He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess.&#160; I was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn, whence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field on the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a speaking-trumpet: but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I certainly thought it was thunder.&#160; Whereupon seven monsters, like himself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook about the largeness of six scythes.&#160; These people were not so well clad as the first, whose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay.&#160; I kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt them.&#160; However, I made a shift to go forward, till I came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind.&#160; Here it was impossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven, that I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed, that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh.&#160; At the same time I heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me.&#160; Being quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and dispair, I lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my days.&#160; I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children.&#160; I lamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage, against the advice of all my friends and relations.&#160; In this terrible agitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world; where I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and perform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the chronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested by millions.&#160; I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single Lilliputian would be among us.&#160; But this I conceived was to be the least of my misfortunes; for, as human creatures are observed to be more savage and cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that should happen to seize me?&#160; Undoubtedly philosophers are in the right, when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by comparison.&#160; It might have pleased fortune, to have let the Lilliputians find some nation, where the people were as diminutive with respect to them, as they were to me.&#160; And who knows but that even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery.</p>
<p>Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these reflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping-hook.&#160; And therefore, when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as fear could make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking round about under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground.&#160; He considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavours to lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not be able either to scratch or bite him, as I myself have sometimes done with a weasel in England.&#160; At length he ventured to take me behind, by the middle, between his fore-finger and thumb, and brought me within three yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly.&#160; I guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the air above sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers.&#160; All I ventured was to raise mine eyes towards the sun, and place my hands together in a supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy tone, suitable to the condition I then was in: for I apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any little hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy.&#160; But my good star would have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and began to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words, although he could not understand them.&#160; In the mean time I was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning my head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger.&#160; He seemed to apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was a substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.</p>
