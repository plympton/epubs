<p>Those to whom the king had entrusted me, observing how ill I was clad, ordered a tailor to come next morning, and take measure for a suit of clothes.&#160; This operator did his office after a different manner from those of his trade in Europe.&#160; He first took my altitude by a quadrant, and then, with a rule and compasses, described the dimensions and outlines of my whole body, all which he entered upon paper; and in six days brought my clothes very ill made, and quite out of shape, by happening to mistake a figure in the calculation.&#160; But my comfort was, that I observed such accidents very frequent, and little regarded.</p>
<p>During my confinement for want of clothes, and by an indisposition that held me some days longer, I much enlarged my dictionary; and when I went next to court, was able to understand many things the king spoke, and to return him some kind of answers.&#160; His majesty had given orders, that the island should move north-east and by east, to the vertical point over Lagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom below, upon the firm earth.&#160; It was about ninety leagues distant, and our voyage lasted four days and a half.&#160; I was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made in the air by the island.&#160; On the second morning, about eleven o&#8217;clock, the king himself in person, attended by his nobility, courtiers, and officers, having prepared all their musical instruments, played on them for three hours without intermission, so that I was quite stunned with the noise; neither could I possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor informed me.&#160; He said that, the people of their island had their ears adapted to hear &#8220;the music of the spheres, which always played at certain periods, and the court was now prepared to bear their part, in whatever instrument they most excelled.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our journey towards Lagado, the capital city, his majesty ordered that the island should stop over certain towns and villages, from whence he might receive the petitions of his subjects.&#160; And to this purpose, several packthreads were let down, with small weights at the bottom.&#160; On these packthreads the people strung their petitions, which mounted up directly, like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of the string that holds their kite.&#160; Sometimes we received wine and victuals from below, which were drawn up by pulleys.</p>
<p>The knowledge I had in mathematics, gave me great assistance in acquiring their phraseology, which depended much upon that science, and music; and in the latter I was not unskilled.&#160; Their ideas are perpetually conversant in lines and figures.&#160; If they would, for example, praise the beauty of a woman, or any other animal, they describe it by rhombs, circles, parallelograms, ellipses, and other geometrical terms, or by words of art drawn from music, needless here to repeat.&#160; I observed in the king&#8217;s kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments, after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his majesty&#8217;s table.</p>
<p>Their houses are very ill built, the walls bevil, without one right angle in any apartment; and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to practical geometry, which they despise as vulgar and mechanic; those instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their workmen, which occasions perpetual mistakes.&#160; And although they are dexterous enough upon a piece of paper, in the management of the rule, the pencil, and the divider, yet in the common actions and behaviour of life, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward, and unhandy people, nor so slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects, except those of mathematics and music.&#160; They are very bad reasoners, and vehemently given to opposition, unless when they happen to be of the right opinion, which is seldom their case.&#160; Imagination, fancy, and invention, they are wholly strangers to, nor have any words in their language, by which those ideas can be expressed; the whole compass of their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned sciences.</p>
<p>Most of them, and especially those who deal in the astronomical part, have great faith in judicial astrology, although they are ashamed to own it publicly.&#160; But what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether unaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in them towards news and politics, perpetually inquiring into public affairs, giving their judgments in matters of state, and passionately disputing every inch of a party opinion.&#160; I have indeed observed the same disposition among most of the mathematicians I have known in Europe, although I could never discover the least analogy between the two sciences; unless those people suppose, that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the largest, therefore the regulation and management of the world require no more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe; but I rather take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature, inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have least concern, and for which we are least adapted by study or nature.</p>
<p>These people are under continual disquietudes, never enjoying a minutes peace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little affect the rest of mortals.&#160; Their apprehensions arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies: for instance, that the earth, by the continual approaches of the sun towards it, must, in course of time, be absorbed, or swallowed up; that the face of the sun, will, by degrees, be encrusted with its own effluvia, and give no more light to the world; that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the tail of the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes; and that the next, which they have calculated for one-and-thirty years hence, will probably destroy us.&#160; For if, in its perihelion, it should approach within a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations they have reason to dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron, and in its absence from the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long, through which, if the earth should pass at the distance of one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus, or main body of the comet, it must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes: that the sun, daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will at last be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attended with the destruction of this earth, and of all the planets that receive their light from it.</p>
<p>They are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these, and the like impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in their beds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of life.&#160; When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the first question is about the sun&#8217;s health, how he looked at his setting and rising, and what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet.&#160; This conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits and hobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to bed for fear.</p>
<p>The women of the island have abundance of vivacity: they, contemn their husbands, and are exceedingly fond of strangers, whereof there is always a considerable number from the continent below, attending at court, either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations, or their own particular occasions, but are much despised, because they want the same endowments.&#160; Among these the ladies choose their gallants: but the vexation is, that they act with too much ease and security; for the husband is always so rapt in speculation, that the mistress and lover may proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face, if he be but provided with paper and implements, and without his flapper at his side.</p>
<p>The wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island, although I think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world; and although they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence, and are allowed to do whatever they please, they long to see the world, and take the diversions of the metropolis, which they are not allowed to do without a particular license from the king; and this is not easy to be obtained, because the people of quality have found, by frequent experience, how hard it is to persuade their women to return from below.&#160; I was told that a great court lady, who had several children,&#8212;is married to the prime minister, the richest subject in the kingdom, a very graceful person, extremely fond of her, and lives in the finest palace of the island,&#8212;went down to Lagado on the pretence of health, there hid herself for several months, till the king sent a warrant to search for her; and she was found in an obscure eating-house all in rags, having pawned her clothes to maintain an old deformed footman, who beat her every day, and in whose company she was taken, much against her will.&#160; And although her husband received her with all possible kindness, and without the least reproach, she soon after contrived to steal down again, with all her jewels, to the same gallant, and has not been heard of since.</p>
<p>This may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an European or English story, than for one of a country so remote.&#160; But he may please to consider, that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate or nation, and that they are much more uniform, than can be easily imagined.</p>
<p>In about a month&#8217;s time, I had made a tolerable proficiency in their language, and was able to answer most of the king&#8217;s questions, when I had the honour to attend him.&#160; His majesty discovered not the least curiosity to inquire into the laws, government, history, religion, or manners of the countries where I had been; but confined his questions to the state of mathematics, and received the account I gave him with great contempt and indifference, though often roused by his flapper on each side.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00024">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy.&#160; The Laputians&#8217; great improvements in the latter.&#160; The king&#8217;s method of suppressing insurrections.</p>
<p>I desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island, which he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to attend me.&#160; I chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in nature, it owed its several motions, whereof I will now give a philosophical account to the reader.</p>
<p>The flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837 yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten thousand acres.&#160; It is three hundred yards thick.&#160; The bottom, or under surface, which appears to those who view it below, is one even regular plate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards.&#160; Above it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over all is a coat of rich mould, ten or twelve feet deep.&#160; The declivity of the upper surface, from the circumference to the centre, is the natural cause why all the dews and rains, which fall upon the island, are conveyed in small rivulets toward the middle, where they are emptied into four large basins, each of about half a mile in circuit, and two hundred yards distant from the centre.&#160; From these basins the water is continually exhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually prevents their overflowing.&#160; Besides, as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the island above the region of clouds and vapours, he can prevent the falling of dews and rain whenever he pleases.&#160; For the highest clouds cannot rise above two miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were never known to do so in that country.</p>
<p>At the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in diameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is therefore called <i>flandona gagnole</i>, or the astronomer&#8217;s cave, situated at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant.&#160; In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which, from the reflection of the adamant, cast a strong light into every part.&#160; The place is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes, astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments.&#160; But the greatest curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver&#8217;s shuttle.&#160; It is in length six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over.&#160; This magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its middle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest hand can turn it.&#160; It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant, four feet yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by eight adamantine feet, each six yards high.&#160; In the middle of the concave side, there is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the extremities of the axle are lodged, and turned round as there is occasion.</p>
<p>The stone cannot be removed from its place by any force, because the hoop and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which constitutes the bottom of the island.</p>
<p>By means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and move from one place to another.&#160; For, with respect to that part of the earth over which the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of its sides with an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.&#160; Upon placing the magnet erect, with its attracting end towards the earth, the island descends; but when the repelling extremity points downwards, the island mounts directly upwards.&#160; When the position of the stone is oblique, the motion of the island is so too: for in this magnet, the forces always act in lines parallel to its direction.</p>
<p>By this oblique motion, the island is conveyed to different parts of the monarch&#8217;s dominions.&#160; To explain the manner of its progress, let <i>A</i> <i>B</i> represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line <i>c</i> <i>d</i> represent the loadstone, of which let <i>d</i> be the repelling end, and <i>c</i> the attracting end, the island being over <i>C</i>: let the stone be placed in position <i>c</i> <i>d</i>, with its repelling end downwards; then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards <i>D</i>.&#160; When it is arrived at <i>D</i>, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end points towards <i>E</i>, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards <i>E</i>; where, if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in the position <i>E</i> <i>F</i>, with its repelling point downwards, the island will rise obliquely towards <i>F</i>, where, by directing the attracting end towards <i>G</i>, the island may be carried to <i>G</i>, and from <i>G</i> to <i>H</i>, by turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point directly downward.&#160; And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as often as there is occasion, the island is made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other.</p>
<p>But it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent of the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.&#160; For which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the stone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does not extend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral, which acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six leagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe, but terminated with the limits of the king&#8217;s dominions; and it was easy, from the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of that magnet.</p>
<p>When the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island stands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal distance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing downwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can ensue.</p>
<p>This loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who, from time to time, give it such positions as the monarch directs.&#160; They spend the greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which they do by the assistance of glasses, far excelling ours in goodness.&#160; For, although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they magnify much more than those of a hundred with us, and show the stars with greater clearness.&#160; This advantage has enabled them to extend their discoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe; for they have made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of ours do not contain above one third part of that number.&#160; They have likewise discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars; whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost, five; the former revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one and a half; so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of Mars; which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>They have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their periods with great exactness.&#160; If this be true (and they affirm it with great confidence) it is much to be wished, that their observations were made public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very lame and defective, might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of astronomy.</p>
<p>The king would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he could but prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these having their estates below on the continent, and considering that the office of a favourite has a very uncertain tenure, would never consent to the enslaving of their country.</p>
<p>If any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent factions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods of reducing them to obedience.&#160; The first and the mildest course is, by keeping the island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it, whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain, and consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases: and if the crime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with great stones, against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars or caves, while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces.&#160; But if they still continue obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections, he proceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly upon their heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men.&#160; However, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven, neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare his ministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them odious to the people, so it would be a great damage to their own estates, which all lie below; for the island is the king&#8217;s demesne.</p>
<p>But there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action, unless upon the utmost necessity.&#160; For, if the town intended to be destroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in the larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view to prevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires, or pillars of stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the island, which, although it consist, as I have said, of one entire adamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a shock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below, as the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in our chimneys.&#160; Of all this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.&#160; And the king, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a city to rubbish, orders the island to descend with great gentleness, out of a pretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for fear of breaking the adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their philosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the whole mass would fall to the ground.</p>
<p>By a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his two eldest sons, are permitted to leave the island; nor the queen, till she is past child-bearing.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00025">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author leaves Laputa; is conveyed to Balnibarbi; arrives at the metropolis.&#160; A description of the metropolis, and the country adjoining.&#160; The author hospitably received by a great lord.&#160; His conversation with that lord.</p>
<p>Although I cannot say that I was ill treated in this island, yet I must confess I thought myself too much neglected, not without some degree of contempt; for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any part of knowledge, except mathematics and music, wherein I was far their inferior, and upon that account very little regarded.</p>
<p>On the other side, after having seen all the curiosities of the island, I was very desirous to leave it, being heartily weary of those people.&#160; They were indeed excellent in two sciences for which I have great esteem, and wherein I am not unversed; but, at the same time, so abstracted and involved in speculation, that I never met with such disagreeable companions.&#160; I conversed only with women, tradesmen, flappers, and court-pages, during two months of my abode there; by which, at last, I rendered myself extremely contemptible; yet these were the only people from whom I could ever receive a reasonable answer.</p>
<p>I had obtained, by hard study, a good degree of knowledge in their language: I was weary of being confined to an island where I received so little countenance, and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity.</p>
<p>There was a great lord at court, nearly related to the king, and for that reason alone used with respect.&#160; He was universally reckoned the most ignorant and stupid person among them.&#160; He had performed many eminent services for the crown, had great natural and acquired parts, adorned with integrity and honour; but so ill an ear for music, that his detractors reported, &#8220;he had been often known to beat time in the wrong place;&#8221; neither could his tutors, without extreme difficulty, teach him to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics.&#160; He was pleased to show me many marks of favour, often did me the honour of a visit, desired to be informed in the affairs of Europe, the laws and customs, the manners and learning of the several countries where I had travelled.&#160; He listened to me with great attention, and made very wise observations on all I spoke.&#160; He had two flappers attending him for state, but never made use of them, except at court and in visits of ceremony, and would always command them to withdraw, when we were alone together.</p>
<p>I entreated this illustrious person, to intercede in my behalf with his majesty, for leave to depart; which he accordingly did, as he was pleased to tell me, with regret: for indeed he had made me several offers very advantageous, which, however, I refused, with expressions of the highest acknowledgment.</p>
<p>On the 16th of February I took leave of his majesty and the court.&#160; The king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds English, and my protector, his kinsman, as much more, together with a letter of recommendation to a friend of his in Lagado, the metropolis.&#160; The island being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it, I was let down from the lowest gallery, in the same manner as I had been taken up.</p>
<p>The continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying island, passes under the general name of <i>Balnibarbi</i>; and the metropolis, as I said before, is called <i>Lagado</i>.&#160; I felt some little satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground.&#160; I walked to the city without any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and sufficiently instructed to converse with them.&#160; I soon found out the person&#8217;s house to whom I was recommended, presented my letter from his friend the grandee in the island, and was received with much kindness.&#160; This great lord, whose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his own house, where I continued during my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable manner.</p>
<p>The next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the town, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very strangely built, and most of them out of repair.&#160; The people in the streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in rags.&#160; We passed through one of the town gates, and went about three miles into the country, where I saw many labourers working with several sorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they were about: neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass, although the soil appeared to be excellent.&#160; I could not forbear admiring at these odd appearances, both in town and country; and I made bold to desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me, what could be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the streets and the fields, because I did not discover any good effects they produced; but, on the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily cultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.</p>
<p>This lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some years governor of Lagado; but, by a cabal of ministers, was discharged for insufficiency.&#160; However, the king treated him with tenderness, as a well-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.</p>
<p>When I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he made no further answer than by telling me, &#8220;that I had not been long enough among them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of the world had different customs;&#8221; with other common topics to the same purpose.&#160; But, when we returned to his palace, he asked me &#8220;how I liked the building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with the dress or looks of his domestics?&#8221;&#160; This he might safely do; because every thing about him was magnificent, regular, and polite.&#160; I answered, &#8220;that his excellency&#8217;s prudence, quality, and fortune, had exempted him from those defects, which folly and beggary had produced in others.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;if I would go with him to his country-house, about twenty miles distant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this kind of conversation.&#8221;&#160; I told his excellency &#8220;that I was entirely at his disposal;&#8221; and accordingly we set out next morning.</p>
<p>During our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers in managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable; for, except in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of corn or blade of grass.&#160; But, in three hours travelling, the scene was wholly altered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers&#8217; houses, at small distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards, corn-grounds, and meadows.&#160; Neither do I remember to have seen a more delightful prospect.&#160; His excellency observed my countenance to clear up; he told me, with a sigh, &#8220;that there his estate began, and would continue the same, till we should come to his house: that his countrymen ridiculed and despised him, for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so ill an example to the kingdom; which, however, was followed by very few, such as were old, and wilful, and weak like himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>We came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure, built according to the best rules of ancient architecture.&#160; The fountains, gardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with exact judgment and taste.&#160; I gave due praises to every thing I saw, whereof his excellency took not the least notice till after supper; when, there being no third companion, he told me with a very melancholy air &#8220;that he doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country, to rebuild them after the present mode; destroy all his plantations, and cast others into such a form as modern usage required, and give the same directions to all his tenants, unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride, singularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and perhaps increase his majesty&#8217;s displeasure; that the admiration I appeared to be under would cease or diminish, when he had informed me of some particulars which, probably, I never heard of at court, the people there being too much taken up in their own speculations, to have regard to what passed here below.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sum of his discourse was to this effect: &#8220;That about forty years ago, certain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or diversion, and, after five months continuance, came back with a very little smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that airy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to dislike the management of every thing below, and fell into schemes of putting all arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot.&#160; To this end, they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in Lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy.&#160; In these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to last for ever without repairing.&#160; All the fruits of the earth shall come to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a hundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy proposals.&#160; The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are yet brought to perfection; and in the mean time, the whole country lies miserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or clothes.&#160; By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are fifty times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes, driven equally on by hope and despair: that as for himself, being not of an enterprising spirit, he was content to go on in the old forms, to live in the houses his ancestors had built, and act as they did, in every part of life, without innovation: that some few other persons of quality and gentry had done the same, but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill-will, as enemies to art, ignorant, and ill common-wealth&#8217;s men, preferring their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their country.&#8221;</p>
<p>His lordship added, &#8220;That he would not, by any further particulars, prevent the pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand academy, whither he was resolved I should go.&#8221;&#160; He only desired me to observe a ruined building, upon the side of a mountain about three miles distant, of which he gave me this account: &#8220;That he had a very convenient mill within half a mile of his house, turned by a current from a large river, and sufficient for his own family, as well as a great number of his tenants; that about seven years ago, a club of those projectors came to him with proposals to destroy this mill, and build another on the side of that mountain, on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut, for a repository of water, to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply the mill, because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water, and thereby made it fitter for motion, and because the water, descending down a declivity, would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose course is more upon a level.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;that being then not very well with the court, and pressed by many of his friends, he complied with the proposal; and after employing a hundred men for two years, the work miscarried, the projectors went off, laying the blame entirely upon him, railing at him ever since, and putting others upon the same experiment, with equal assurance of success, as well as equal disappointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few days we came back to town; and his excellency, considering the bad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but recommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither.&#160; My lord was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects, and a person of much curiosity and easy belief; which, indeed, was not without truth; for I had myself been a sort of projector in my younger days.</p>

<p>This academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of several houses on both sides of a street, which growing waste, was purchased and applied to that use.</p>
<p>I was received very kindly by the warden, and went for many days to the academy.&#160; Every room has in it one or more projectors; and I believe I could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms.</p>
<p>The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face, his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places.&#160; His clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour.&#160; He has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers.&#160; He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should be able to supply the governor&#8217;s gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low, and entreated me &#8220;to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.&#8221;&#160; I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.</p>
<p>I went into another chamber, but was ready to hasten back, being almost overcome with a horrible stink.&#160; My conductor pressed me forward, conjuring me in a whisper &#8220;to give no offence, which would be highly resented;&#8221; and therefore I durst not so much as stop my nose.&#160; The projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his face and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over with filth.&#160; When I was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a compliment I could well have excused.&#160; His employment, from his first coming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to its original food, by separating the several parts, removing the tincture which it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and scumming off the saliva.&#160; He had a weekly allowance, from the society, of a vessel filled with human ordure, about the bigness of a Bristol barrel.</p>
<p>I saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise showed me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire, which he intended to publish.</p>
<p>There was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method for building houses, by beginning at the roof, and working downward to the foundation; which he justified to me, by the like practice of those two prudent insects, the bee and the spider.</p>
<p>There was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own condition: their employment was to mix colours for painters, which their master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling.&#160; It was indeed my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their lessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken.&#160; This artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity.</p>
<p>In another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had found a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges of ploughs, cattle, and labour.&#160; The method is this: in an acre of ground you bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity of acorns, dates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are fondest; then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field, where, in a few days, they will root up the whole ground in search of their food, and make it fit for sowing, at the same time manuring it with their dung: it is true, upon experiment, they found the charge and trouble very great, and they had little or no crop.&#160; However it is not doubted, that this invention may be capable of great improvement.</p>
<p>I went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all hung round with cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out.&#160; At my entrance, he called aloud to me, &#8220;not to disturb his webs.&#8221;&#160; He lamented &#8220;the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of using silkworms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely excelled the former, because they understood how to weave, as well as spin.&#8221;&#160; And he proposed further, &#8220;that by employing spiders, the charge of dyeing silks should be wholly saved;&#8221; whereof I was fully convinced, when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured, wherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us &#8220;that the webs would take a tincture from them; and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit everybody&#8217;s fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the flies, of certain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter, to give a strength and consistence to the threads.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an astronomer, who had undertaken to place a sun-dial upon the great weathercock on the town-house, by adjusting the annual and diurnal motions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide with all accidental turnings of the wind.</p>
<p>I was complaining of a small fit of the colic, upon which my conductor led me into a room where a great physician resided, who was famous for curing that disease, by contrary operations from the same instrument.&#160; He had a large pair of bellows, with a long slender muzzle of ivory: this he conveyed eight inches up the anus, and drawing in the wind, he affirmed he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder.&#160; But when the disease was more stubborn and violent, he let in the muzzle while the bellows were full of wind, which he discharged into the body of the patient; then withdrew the instrument to replenish it, clapping his thumb strongly against the orifice of then fundament; and this being repeated three or four times, the adventitious wind would rush out, bringing the noxious along with it, (like water put into a pump), and the patient recovered.&#160; I saw him try both experiments upon a dog, but could not discern any effect from the former.&#160; After the latter the animal was ready to burst, and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my companion.&#160; The dog died on the spot, and we left the doctor endeavouring to recover him, by the same operation.</p>
<p>I visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader with all the curiosities I observed, being studious of brevity.</p>
<p>I had hitherto seen only one side of the academy, the other being appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall say something, when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is called among them &#8220;the universal artist.&#8221;&#160; He told us &#8220;he had been thirty years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life.&#8221;&#160; He had two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at work.&#160; Some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting the nitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others softening marble, for pillows and pin-cushions; others petrifying the hoofs of a living horse, to preserve them from foundering.&#160; The artist himself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not skilful enough to comprehend.&#160; The other was, by a certain composition of gums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped, in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep, all over the kingdom.</p>
<p>We crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have already said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.</p>
<p>The first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils about him.&#160; After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of the room, he said, &#8220;Perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical operations.&#160; But the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness; and he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in any other man&#8217;s head.&#160; Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.&#8221;&#160; He then led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in ranks.&#160; It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room.&#160; The superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but some larger than others.&#160; They were all linked together by slender wires.&#160; These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without any order.&#160; The professor then desired me &#8220;to observe; for he was going to set his engine at work.&#8221;&#160; The pupils, at his command, took each of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed.&#160; He then commanded six-and-thirty of the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were scribes.&#160; This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn, the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as the square bits of wood moved upside down.</p>
<p class="c1"><a>The frame</a></p>
<p>Six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour; and the professor showed me several volumes in large folio, already collected, of broken sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of those rich materials, to give the world a complete body of all arts and sciences; which, however, might be still improved, and much expedited, if the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such frames in Lagado, and oblige the managers to contribute in common their several collections.</p>
<p>He assured me &#8220;that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his youth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame, and made the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books between the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other parts of speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>I made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for his great communicativeness; and promised, &#8220;if ever I had the good fortune to return to my native country, that I would do him justice, as the sole inventor of this wonderful machine;&#8221; the form and contrivance of which I desired leave to delineate on paper, as in the figure here annexed.&#160; I told him, &#8220;although it were the custom of our learned in Europe to steal inventions from each other, who had thereby at least this advantage, that it became a controversy which was the right owner; yet I would take such caution, that he should have the honour entire, without a rival.&#8221;</p>
<p>We next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat in consultation upon improving that of their own country.</p>
<p>The first project was, to shorten discourse, by cutting polysyllables into one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because, in reality, all things imaginable are but norms.</p>
<p>The other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words whatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health, as well as brevity.&#160; For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in some degree, a diminution of our lunge by corrosion, and, consequently, contributes to the shortening of our lives.&#160; An expedient was therefore offered, &#8220;that since words are only names for things, it would be more convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary to express a particular business they are to discourse on.&#8221;&#160; And this invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people.&#160; However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this inconvenience attending it, that if a man&#8217;s business be very great, and of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend him.&#160; I have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements, help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.</p>
<p>But for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets, and under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be at a loss.&#160; Therefore the room where company meet who practise this art, is full of all things, ready at hand, requisite to furnish matter for this kind of artificial converse.</p>
<p>Another great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would serve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilised nations, whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or nearly resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended.&#160; And thus ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or ministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.</p>
<p>I was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils after a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe.&#160; The proposition, and demonstration, were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed of a cephalic tincture.&#160; This, the student was to swallow upon a fasting stomach, and for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.&#160; As the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the proposition along with it.&#160; But the success has not hitherto been answerable, partly by some error in the <i>quantum</i> or composition, and partly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous, that they generally steal aside, and discharge it upwards, before it can operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an abstinence, as the prescription requires.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00027">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A further account of the academy.&#160; The author proposes some improvements, which are honourably received.</p>
<p>In the school of political projectors, I was but ill entertained; the professors appearing, in my judgment, wholly out of their senses, which is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy.&#160; These unhappy people were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon the score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching ministers to consult the public good; of rewarding merit, great abilities, eminent services; of instructing princes to know their true interest, by placing it on the same foundation with that of their people; of choosing for employments persons qualified to exercise them, with many other wild, impossible chimeras, that never entered before into the heart of man to conceive; and confirmed in me the old observation, &#8220;that there is nothing so extravagant and irrational, which some philosophers have not maintained for truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, however, I shall so far do justice to this part of the Academy, as to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary.&#160; There was a most ingenious doctor, who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature and system of government.&#160; This illustrious person had very usefully employed his studies, in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are subject, by the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as by the licentiousness of those who are to obey.&#160; For instance: whereas all writers and reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal resemblance between the natural and the political body; can there be any thing more evident, than that the health of both must be preserved, and the diseases cured, by the same prescriptions?&#160; It is allowed, that senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient, and other peccant humours; with many diseases of the head, and more of the heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the nerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the right; with spleen, flatus, vertigos, and deliriums; with scrofulous tumours, full of fetid purulent matter; with sour frothy ructations: with canine appetites, and crudeness of digestion, besides many others, needless to mention.&#160; This doctor therefore proposed, &#8220;that upon the meeting of the senate, certain physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting, and at the close of each day&#8217;s debate feel the pulses of every senator; after which, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the several maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth day return to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries stored with proper medicines; and before the members sat, administer to each of them lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives, restringents, palliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics, acoustics, as their several cases required; and, according as these medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them, at the next meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>This project could not be of any great expense to the public; and might in my poor opinion, be of much use for the despatch of business, in those countries where senates have any share in the legislative power; beget unanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now closed, and close many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of the young, and correct the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid, and damp the pert.</p>
<p>Again: because it is a general complaint, that the favourites of princes are troubled with short and weak memories; the same doctor proposed, &#8220;that whoever attended a first minister, after having told his business, with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words, should, at his departure, give the said minister a tweak by the nose, or a kick in the belly, or tread on his corns, or lug him thrice by both ears, or run a pin into his breech; or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent forgetfulness; and at every levee day, repeat the same operation, till the business were done, or absolutely refused.&#8221;</p>
<p>He likewise directed, &#8220;that every senator in the great council of a nation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the defence of it, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if that were done, the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>When parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance to reconcile them.&#160; The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of each party; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest of a size; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple at the same time, in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided.&#160; Let the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the head of his opposite party-man.&#160; It seems indeed to be a work that requires some exactness, but the professor assured us, &#8220;that if it were dexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.&#8221;&#160; For he argued thus: &#8220;that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between themselves within the space of one skull, would soon come to a good understanding, and produce that moderation, as well as regularity of thinking, so much to be wished for in the heads of those, who imagine they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion: and as to the difference of brains, in quantity or quality, among those who are directors in faction, the doctor assured us, from his own knowledge, that &#8220;it was a perfect trifle.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money, without grieving the subject.&#160; The first affirmed, &#8220;the justest method would be, to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly; and the sum fixed upon every man to be rated, after the fairest manner, by a jury of his neighbours.&#8221;&#160; The second was of an opinion directly contrary; &#8220;to tax those qualities of body and mind, for which men chiefly value themselves; the rate to be more or less, according to the degrees of excelling; the decision whereof should be left entirely to their own breast.&#8221;&#160; The highest tax was upon men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex, and the assessments, according to the number and nature of the favours they have received; for which, they are allowed to be their own vouchers.&#160; Wit, valour, and politeness, were likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and collected in the same manner, by every person&#8217;s giving his own word for the quantum of what he possessed.&#160; But as to honour, justice, wisdom, and learning, they should not be taxed at all; because they are qualifications of so singular a kind, that no man will either allow them in his neighbour or value them in himself.</p>
<p>The women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill in dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be determined by their own judgment.&#160; But constancy, chastity, good sense, and good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge of collecting.</p>
<p>To keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the members should raffle for employment; every man first taking an oath, and giving security, that he would vote for the court, whether he won or not; after which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of raffling upon the next vacancy.&#160; Thus, hope and expectation would be kept alive; none would complain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments wholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of a ministry.</p>
<p>Another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering plots and conspiracies against the government.&#160; He advised great statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons; their times of eating; upon which side they lay in bed; with which hand they wipe their posteriors; take a strict view of their excrements, and, from the colour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity of digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts and designs; because men are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent, as when they are at stool, which he found by frequent experiment; for, in such conjunctures, when he used, merely as a trial, to consider which was the best way of murdering the king, his ordure would have a tincture of green; but quite different, when he thought only of raising an insurrection, or burning the metropolis.</p>
<p>The whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing many observations, both curious and useful for politicians; but, as I conceived, not altogether complete.&#160; This I ventured to tell the author, and offered, if he pleased, to supply him with some additions.&#160; He received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers, especially those of the projecting species, professing &#8220;he would be glad to receive further information.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him, &#8220;that in the kingdom of Tribnia, <a id="citation454a"></a><a href="gullivers-travelsinto-several-remote-nations-of-the-world-7.html#footnote454a" class="citation dlinternal">[454a]</a> by the natives called Langdon, <a id="citation454b"></a><a href="gullivers-travelsinto-several-remote-nations-of-the-world-7.html#footnote454b" class="citation dlinternal">[454b]</a> where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers, witnesses, informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the colours, the conduct, and the pay of ministers of state, and their deputies.&#160; The plots, in that kingdom, are usually the workmanship of those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound politicians; to restore new vigour to a crazy administration; to stifle or divert general discontents; to fill their coffers with forfeitures; and raise, or sink the opinion of public credit, as either shall best answer their private advantage.&#160; It is first agreed and settled among them, what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then, effectual care is taken to secure all their letters and papers, and put the owners in chains.&#160; These papers are delivered to a set of artists, very dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words, syllables, and letters: for instance, they can discover a close stool, to signify a privy council; a flock of geese, a senate; a lame dog, an invader; the plague, a standing army; a buzzard, a prime minister; the gout, a high priest; a gibbet, a secretary of state; a chamber pot, a committee of grandees; a sieve, a court lady; a broom, a revolution; a mouse-trap, an employment; a bottomless pit, a treasury; a sink, a court; a cap and bells, a favourite; a broken reed, a court of justice; an empty tun, a general; a running sore, the administration. <a id="citation455"></a><a href="gullivers-travelsinto-several-remote-nations-of-the-world-7.html#footnote455" class="citation dlinternal">[455]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;When this method fails, they have two others more effectual, which the learned among them call acrostics and anagrams.&#160; First, they can decipher all initial letters into political meanings.&#160; Thus <i>N</i>, shall signify a plot; <i>B</i>, a regiment of horse; <i>L</i>, a fleet at sea; or, secondly, by transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper, they can lay open the deepest designs of a discontented party.&#160; So, for example, if I should say, in a letter to a friend, &#8216;Our brother Tom has just got the piles,&#8217; a skilful decipherer would discover, that the same letters which compose that sentence, may be analysed into the following words, &#8216;Resist ---, a plot is brought home&#8212;The tour.&#8217;&#160; And this is the anagrammatic method.&#8221;</p>
<p>The professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these observations, and promised to make honourable mention of me in his treatise.</p>
<p>I saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer continuance, and began to think of returning home to England.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00028">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author leaves Lagado: arrives at Maldonada.&#160; No ship ready.&#160; He takes a short voyage to Glubbdubdrib.&#160; His reception by the governor.</p>
<p>The continent, of which this kingdom is apart, extends itself, as I have reason to believe, eastward, to that unknown tract of America westward of California; and north, to the Pacific Ocean, which is not above a hundred and fifty miles from Lagado; where there is a good port, and much commerce with the great island of Luggnagg, situated to the north-west about 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude.&#160; This island of Luggnagg stands south-eastward of Japan, about a hundred leagues distant.&#160; There is a strict alliance between the Japanese emperor and the king of Luggnagg; which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island to the other.&#160; I determined therefore to direct my course this way, in order to my return to Europe.&#160; I hired two mules, with a guide, to show me the way, and carry my small baggage.&#160; I took leave of my noble protector, who had shown me so much favour, and made me a generous present at my departure.</p>
<p>My journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating.&#160; When I arrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there was no ship in the harbour bound for Luggnagg, nor likely to be in some time.&#160; The town is about as large as Portsmouth.&#160; I soon fell into some acquaintance, and was very hospitably received.&#160; A gentleman of distinction said to me, &#8220;that since the ships bound for Luggnagg could not be ready in less than a month, it might be no disagreeable amusement for me to take a trip to the little island of Glubbdubdrib, about five leagues off to the south-west.&#8221;&#160; He offered himself and a friend to accompany me, and that I should be provided with a small convenient bark for the voyage.</p>
<p>Glubbdubdrib, as nearly as I can interpret the word, signifies the island of sorcerers or magicians.&#160; It is about one third as large as the Isle of Wight, and extremely fruitful: it is governed by the head of a certain tribe, who are all magicians.&#160; This tribe marries only among each other, and the eldest in succession is prince or governor.&#160; He has a noble palace, and a park of about three thousand acres, surrounded by a wall of hewn stone twenty feet high.&#160; In this park are several small enclosures for cattle, corn, and gardening.</p>
<p>The governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a kind somewhat unusual.&#160; By his skill in necromancy he has a power of calling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service for twenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons up again in less than three months, except upon very extraordinary occasions.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the island, which was about eleven in the morning, one of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor, and desired admittance for a stranger, who came on purpose to have the honour of attending on his highness.&#160; This was immediately granted, and we all three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards, armed and dressed after a very antic manner, and with something in their countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot express.&#160; We passed through several apartments, between servants of the same sort, ranked on each side as before, till we came to the chamber of presence; where, after three profound obeisances, and a few general questions, we were permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest step of his highness&#8217;s throne.&#160; He understood the language of Balnibarbi, although it was different from that of this island.&#160; He desired me to give him some account of my travels; and, to let me see that I should be treated without ceremony, he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his finger; at which, to my great astonishment, they vanished in an instant, like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.&#160; I could not recover myself in some time, till the governor assured me, &#8220;that I should receive no hurt:&#8221; and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had been often entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and related to his highness a short history of my several adventures; yet not without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place where I had seen those domestic spectres.&#160; I had the honour to dine with the governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at table.&#160; I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the morning.&#160; I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace.&#160; My two friends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the capital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay our duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.</p>
<p>After this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of every day with the governor, and at night in our lodging.&#160; I soon grew so familiarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth time they gave me no emotion at all: or, if I had any apprehensions left, my curiosity prevailed over them.&#160; For his highness the governor ordered me &#8220;to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever numbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the present time, and command them to answer any questions I should think fit to ask; with this condition, that my questions must be confined within the compass of the times they lived in.&#160; And one thing I might depend upon, that they would certainly tell me the truth, for lying was a talent of no use in the lower world.&#8221;</p>
<p>I made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour.&#160; We were in a chamber, from whence there was a fair prospect into the park.&#160; And because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes of pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great at the head of his army, just after the battle of Arbela: which, upon a motion of the governor&#8217;s finger, immediately appeared in a large field, under the window where we stood.&#160; Alexander was called up into the room: it was with great difficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but little of my own.&#160; He assured me upon his honour &#8220;that he was not poisoned, but died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me &#8220;he had not a drop of vinegar in his camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw C&#230;sar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to engage.&#160; I saw the former, in his last great triumph.&#160; I desired that the senate of Rome might appear before me, in one large chamber, and an assembly of somewhat a later age in counterview, in another.&#160; The first seemed to be an assembly of heroes and demigods; the other, a knot of pedlars, pick-pockets, highwayman, and bullies.</p>
<p>The governor, at my request, gave the sign for C&#230;sar and Brutus to advance towards us.&#160; I was struck with a profound veneration at the sight of Brutus, and could easily discover the most consummate virtue, the greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind, the truest love of his country, and general benevolence for mankind, in every lineament of his countenance.&#160; I observed, with much pleasure, that these two persons were in good intelligence with each other; and C&#230;sar freely confessed to me, &#8220;that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal, by many degrees, to the glory of taking it away.&#8221;&#160; I had the honour to have much conversation with Brutus; and was told, &#8220;that his ancestor Junius, Socrates, Epaminondas, Cato the younger, Sir Thomas More, and himself were perpetually together:&#8221; a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the world cannot add a seventh.</p>
<p>It would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire I had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me.&#160; I chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and usurpers, and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations.&#160; But it is impossible to express the satisfaction I received in my own mind, after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the reader.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00029">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A further account of Glubbdubdrib.&#160; Ancient and modern history corrected.</p>
<p>Having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and learning, I set apart one day on purpose.&#160; I proposed that Homer and Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these were so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court, and outward rooms of the palace.&#160; I knew, and could distinguish those two heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.&#160; Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever beheld.&#160; Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff.&#160; His visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow.&#160; I soon discovered that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless, &#8220;that these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.&#8221;&#160; I introduced Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet.&#160; But Aristotle was out of all patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented them to him; and he asked them, &#8220;whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as themselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>I then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom I prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle.&#160; This great philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy, because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must do; and he found that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus as palatable as he could, and the vortices of Descartes, were equally to be exploded.&#160; He predicted the same fate to <i>attraction</i>, whereof the present learned are such zealous asserters.&#160; He said, &#8220;that new systems of nature were but new fashions, which would vary in every age; and even those, who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles, would flourish but a short period of time, and be out of vogue when that was determined.&#8221;</p>
<p>I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.&#160; I saw most of the first Roman emperors.&#160; I prevailed on the governor to call up Heliogabalus&#8217;s cooks to dress us a dinner, but they could not show us much of their skill, for want of materials.&#160; A helot of Agesilaus made us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able to get down a second spoonful.</p>
<p>The two gentlemen, who conducted me to the island, were pressed by their private affairs to return in three days, which I employed in seeing some of the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure, for two or three hundred years past, in our own and other countries of Europe; and having been always a great admirer of old illustrious families, I desired the governor would call up a dozen or two of kings, with their ancestors in order for eight or nine generations.&#160; But my disappointment was grievous and unexpected.&#160; For, instead of a long train with royal diadems, I saw in one family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an Italian prelate.&#160; In another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals.&#160; I have too great a veneration for crowned heads, to dwell any longer on so nice a subject.&#160; But as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was not so scrupulous.&#160; And I confess, it was not without some pleasure, that I found myself able to trace the particular features, by which certain families are distinguished, up to their originals.&#160; I could plainly discover whence one family derives a long chin; why a second has abounded with knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a third happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence it came, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, <i>Nec vir fortis</i>, <i>nec foemina casta</i>; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice, grew to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much as by their coats of arms; who first brought the pox into a noble house, which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity.&#160; Neither could I wonder at all this, when I saw such an interruption of lineages, by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen, gamesters, fiddlers, players, captains, and pickpockets.</p>
<p>I was chiefly disgusted with modern history.&#160; For having strictly examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes, for a hundred years past, I found how the world had been misled by prostitute writers, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war, to cowards; the wisest counsel, to fools; sincerity, to flatterers; Roman virtue, to betrayers of their country; piety, to atheists; chastity, to sodomites; truth, to informers: how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the corruption of judges, and the malice of factions: how many villains had been exalted to the highest places of trust, power, dignity, and profit: how great a share in the motions and events of courts, councils, and senates might be challenged by bawds, whores, pimps, parasites, and buffoons.&#160; How low an opinion I had of human wisdom and integrity, when I was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and revolutions in the world, and of the contemptible accidents to which they owed their success.</p>
<p>Here I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write anecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their graves with a cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief minister, where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and cabinets of ambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the perpetual misfortune to be mistaken.&#160; Here I discovered the true causes of many great events that have surprised the world; how a whore can govern the back-stairs, the back-stairs a council, and the council a senate.&#160; A general confessed, in my presence, &#8220;that he got a victory purely by the force of cowardice and ill conduct;&#8221; and an admiral, &#8220;that, for want of proper intelligence, he beat the enemy, to whom he intended to betray the fleet.&#8221;&#160; Three kings protested to me, &#8220;that in their whole reigns they never did once prefer any person of merit, unless by mistake, or treachery of some minister in whom they confided; neither would they do it if they were to live again:&#8221; and they showed, with great strength of reason, &#8220;that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption, because that positive, confident, restiff temper, which virtue infused into a man, was a perpetual clog to public business.&#8221;</p>
