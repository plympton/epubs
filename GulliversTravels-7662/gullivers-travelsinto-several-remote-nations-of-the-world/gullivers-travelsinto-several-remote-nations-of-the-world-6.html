<h2 id="dlepubid00037">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Houyhnhnm&#8217;s notion of truth and falsehood.&#160; The author&#8217;s discourse disapproved by his master.&#160; The author gives a more particular account of himself, and the accidents of his voyage.</p>
<p>My master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his countenance; because doubting, or not believing, are so little known in this country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves under such circumstances.&#160; And I remember, in frequent discourses with my master concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world, having occasion to talk of lying and false representation, it was with much difficulty that he comprehended what I meant, although he had otherwise a most acute judgment.&#160; For he argued thus: &#8220;that the use of speech was to make us understand one another, and to receive information of facts; now, if any one said the thing which was not, these ends were defeated, because I cannot properly be said to understand him; and I am so far from receiving information, that he leaves me worse than in ignorance; for I am led to believe a thing black, when it is white, and short, when it is long.&#8221;&#160; And these were all the notions he had concerning that faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood, and so universally practised, among human creatures.</p>
<p>To return from this digression.&#160; When I asserted that the <i>Yahoos</i> were the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was altogether past his conception, he desired to know, &#8220;whether we had <i>Houyhnhnms</i> among us, and what was their employment?&#8221;&#160; I told him, &#8220;we had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where <i>Yahoo</i> servants were employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet, serve them with food, and make their beds.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;I understand you well,&#8221; said my master: &#8220;it is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that whatever share of reason the <i>Yahoos</i> pretend to, the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> are your masters; I heartily wish our <i>Yahoos</i> would be so tractable.&#8221;&#160; I begged &#8220;his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further, because I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be highly displeasing.&#8221;&#160; But he insisted in commanding me to let him know the best and the worst.&#160; I told him &#8220;he should be obeyed.&#8221;&#160; I owned &#8220;that the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness; and when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till they died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey.&#160; But the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept by farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to greater labour, and fed them worse.&#8221;&#160; I described, as well as I could, our way of riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of harness and wheels.&#160; I added, &#8220;that we fastened plates of a certain hard substance, called iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their hoofs from being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.&#8221;</p>
<p>My master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered &#8220;how we dared to venture upon a <i>Houyhnhnm&#8217;s</i> back; for he was sure, that the weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest <i>Yahoo</i>; or by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze the brute to death.&#8221;&#160; I answered &#8220;that our horses were trained up, from three or four years old, to the several uses we intended them for; that if any of them proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they were severely beaten, while they were young, for any mischievous tricks; that the males, designed for the common use of riding or draught, were generally castrated about two years after their birth, to take down their spirits, and make them more tame and gentle; that they were indeed sensible of rewards and punishments; but his honour would please to consider, that they had not the least tincture of reason, any more than the <i>Yahoos</i> in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>It put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of words, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us.&#160; But it is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of the <i>Houyhnhnm</i> race; particularly after I had explained the manner and use of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from propagating their kind, and to render them more servile.&#160; He said, &#8220;if it were possible there could be any country where <i>Yahoos</i> alone were endued with reason, they certainly must be the governing animal; because reason in time will always prevail against brutal strength.&#160; But, considering the frame of our bodies, and especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk was so ill-contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of life;&#8221; whereupon he desired to know &#8220;whether those among whom I lived resembled me, or the <i>Yahoos</i> of his country?&#8221;&#160; I assured him, &#8220;that I was as well shaped as most of my age; but the younger, and the females, were much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as white as milk.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;I differed indeed from other <i>Yahoos</i>, being much more cleanly, and not altogether so deformed; but, in point of real advantage, he thought I differed for the worse: that my nails were of no use either to my fore or hinder feet; as to my fore feet, he could not properly call them by that name, for he never observed me to walk upon them; that they were too soft to bear the ground; that I generally went with them uncovered; neither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of the same shape, or so strong as that on my feet behind: that I could not walk with any security, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must inevitably fail.&#8221;&#160; He then began to find fault with other parts of my body: &#8220;the flatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, mine eyes placed directly in front, so that I could not look on either side without turning my head: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one of my fore-feet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints to answer that necessity.&#160; He knew not what could be the use of those several clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering made from the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence against heat and cold, which I was forced to put on and off every day, with tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every animal in this country naturally to abhor the <i>Yahoos</i>, whom the weaker avoided, and the stronger drove from them.&#160; So that, supposing us to have the gift of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural antipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor consequently how we could tame and render them serviceable.&#160; However, he would,&#8221; as he said, &#8220;debate the matter no farther, because he was more desirous to know my own story, the country where I was born, and the several actions and events of my life, before I came hither.&#8221;</p>
<p>I assured him, &#8220;how extremely desirous I was that he should be satisfied on every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be possible for me to explain myself on several subjects, whereof his honour could have no conception; because I saw nothing in his country to which I could resemble them; that, however, I would do my best, and strive to express myself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted proper words;&#8221; which he was pleased to promise me.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England; which was remote from his country, as many days&#8217; journey as the strongest of his honour&#8217;s servants could travel in the annual course of the sun; that I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in the body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country was governed by a female man, whom we called queen; that I left it to get riches, whereby I might maintain myself and family, when I should return; that, in my last voyage, I was commander of the ship, and had about fifty <i>Yahoos</i> under me, many of which died at sea, and I was forced to supply them by others picked out from several nations; that our ship was twice in danger of being sunk, the first time by a great storm, and the second by striking against a rock.&#8221;&#160; Here my master interposed, by asking me, &#8220;how I could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with me, after the losses I had sustained, and the hazards I had run?&#8221;&#160; I said, &#8220;they were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.&#160; Some were undone by lawsuits; others spent all they had in drinking, whoring, and gaming; others fled for treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning, robbery, perjury, forgery, coining false money, for committing rapes, or sodomy; for flying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and most of them had broken prison; none of these durst return to their native countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other places.&#8221;</p>
<p>During this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several times.&#160; I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced to fly their country.&#160; This labour took up several days&#8217; conversation, before he was able to comprehend me.&#160; He was wholly at a loss to know what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices.&#160; To clear up which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and riches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy.&#160; All this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making suppositions.&#160; After which, like one whose imagination was struck with something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with amazement and indignation.&#160; Power, government, war, law, punishment, and a thousand other things, had no terms wherein that language could express them, which made the difficulty almost insuperable, to give my master any conception of what I meant.&#160; But being of an excellent understanding, much improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a competent knowledge of what human nature, in our parts of the world, is capable to perform, and desired I would give him some particular account of that land which we call Europe, but especially of my own country.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00038">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author at his master&#8217;s command, informs him of the state of England. The causes of war among the princes of Europe.&#160; The author begins to explain the English constitution.</p>
<p>The reader may please to observe, that the following extract of many conversations I had with my master, contains a summary of the most material points which were discoursed at several times for above two years; his honour often desiring fuller satisfaction, as I farther improved in the <i>Houyhnhnm</i> tongue.&#160; I laid before him, as well as I could, the whole state of Europe; I discoursed of trade and manufactures, of arts and sciences; and the answers I gave to all the questions he made, as they arose upon several subjects, were a fund of conversation not to be exhausted.&#160; But I shall here only set down the substance of what passed between us concerning my own country, reducing it in order as well as I can, without any regard to time or other circumstances, while I strictly adhere to truth.&#160; My only concern is, that I shall hardly be able to do justice to my master&#8217;s arguments and expressions, which must needs suffer by my want of capacity, as well as by a translation into our barbarous English.</p>
<p>In obedience, therefore, to his honour&#8217;s commands, I related to him the Revolution under the Prince of Orange; the long war with France, entered into by the said prince, and renewed by his successor, the present queen, wherein the greatest powers of Christendom were engaged, and which still continued: I computed, at his request, &#8220;that about a million of <i>Yahoos</i> might have been killed in the whole progress of it; and perhaps a hundred or more cities taken, and five times as many ships burnt or sunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>He asked me, &#8220;what were the usual causes or motives that made one country go to war with another?&#8221;&#160; I answered &#8220;they were innumerable; but I should only mention a few of the chief.&#160; Sometimes the ambition of princes, who never think they have land or people enough to govern; sometimes the corruption of ministers, who engage their master in a war, in order to stifle or divert the clamour of the subjects against their evil administration.&#160; Difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives: for instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the juice of a certain berry be blood or wine; whether whistling be a vice or a virtue; whether it be better to kiss a post, or throw it into the fire; what is the best colour for a coat, whether black, white, red, or gray; and whether it should be long or short, narrow or wide, dirty or clean; with many more.&#160; Neither are any wars so furious and bloody, or of so long a continuance, as those occasioned by difference in opinion, especially if it be in things indifferent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them shall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them pretend to any right.&#160; Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the other should quarrel with him.&#160; Sometimes a war is entered upon, because the enemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too weak.&#160; Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the things which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us theirs.&#160; It is a very justifiable cause of a war, to invade a country after the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or embroiled by factions among themselves.&#160; It is justifiable to enter into war against our nearest ally, when one of his towns lies convenient for us, or a territory of land, that would render our dominions round and complete.&#160; If a prince sends forces into a nation, where the people are poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make slaves of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their barbarous way of living.&#160; It is a very kingly, honourable, and frequent practice, when one prince desires the assistance of another, to secure him against an invasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out the invader, should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or banish, the prince he came to relieve.&#160; Alliance by blood, or marriage, is a frequent cause of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the greater their disposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry, and rich nations are proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at variance.&#160; For these reasons, the trade of a soldier is held the most honourable of all others; because a soldier is a <i>Yahoo</i> hired to kill, in cold blood, as many of his own species, who have never offended him, as possibly he can.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in Europe, not able to make war by themselves, who hire out their troops to richer nations, for so much a day to each man; of which they keep three-fourths to themselves, and it is the best part of their maintenance: such are those in many northern parts of Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you have told me,&#8221; said my master, &#8220;upon the subject of war, does indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to: however, it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and that nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief.&#160; For, your mouths lying flat with your faces, you can hardly bite each other to any purpose, unless by consent.&#160; Then as to the claws upon your feet before and behind, they are so short and tender, that one of our <i>Yahoos</i> would drive a dozen of yours before him.&#160; And therefore, in recounting the numbers of those who have been killed in battle, I cannot but think you have said the thing which is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not forbear shaking my head, and smiling a little at his ignorance.&#160; And being no stranger to the art of war, I gave him a description of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols, bullets, powder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines, countermines, bombardments, sea fights, ships sunk with a thousand men, twenty thousand killed on each side, dying groans, limbs flying in the air, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death under horses&#8217; feet, flight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with carcases, left for food to dogs and wolves and birds of prey; plundering, stripping, ravishing, burning, and destroying.&#160; And to set forth the valour of my own dear countrymen, I assured him, &#8220;that I had seen them blow up a hundred enemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and beheld the dead bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great diversion of the spectators.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me silence.&#160; He said, &#8220;whoever understood the nature of <i>Yahoos</i>, might easily believe it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action I had named, if their strength and cunning equalled their malice.&#160; But as my discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species, so he found it gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a stranger before.&#160; He thought his ears, being used to such abominable words, might, by degrees, admit them with less detestation: that although he hated the <i>Yahoos</i> of this country, yet he no more blamed them for their odious qualities, than he did a <i>gnnayh</i> (a bird of prey) for its cruelty, or a sharp stone for cutting his hoof.&#160; But when a creature pretending to reason could be capable of such enormities, he dreaded lest the corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself.&#160; He seemed therefore confident, that, instead of reason we were only possessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices; as the reflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill shapen body, not only larger but more distorted.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;that he had heard too much upon the subject of war, both in this and some former discourses.&#160; There was another point, which a little perplexed him at present.&#160; I had informed him, that some of our crew left their country on account of being ruined by law; that I had already explained the meaning of the word; but he was at a loss how it should come to pass, that the law, which was intended for every man&#8217;s preservation, should be any man&#8217;s ruin.&#160; Therefore he desired to be further satisfied what I meant by law, and the dispensers thereof, according to the present practice in my own country; because he thought nature and reason were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal, as we pretended to be, in showing us what he ought to do, and what to avoid.&#8221;</p>
<p>I assured his honour, &#8220;that the law was a science in which I had not much conversed, further than by employing advocates, in vain, upon some injustices that had been done me: however, I would give him all the satisfaction I was able.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth in the art of proving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is black, and black is white, according as they are paid.&#160; To this society all the rest of the people are slaves.&#160; For example, if my neighbour has a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow from me.&#160; I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself.&#160; Now, in this case, I, who am the right owner, lie under two great disadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practised almost from his cradle in defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an advocate for justice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts with great awkwardness, if not with ill-will.&#160; The second disadvantage is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else he will be reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that would lessen the practice of the law.&#160; And therefore I have but two methods to preserve my cow.&#160; The first is, to gain over my adversary&#8217;s lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray his client by insinuating that he hath justice on his side.&#160; The second way is for my lawyer to make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong to my adversary: and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly bespeak the favour of the bench.&#160; Now your honour is to know, that these judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property, as well as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most dexterous lawyers, who are grown old or lazy; and having been biassed all their lives against truth and equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of favouring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have known some of them refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure the faculty, by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before, may legally be done again: and therefore they take special care to record all the decisions formerly made against common justice, and the general reason of mankind.&#160; These, under the name of precedents, they produce as authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions; and the judges never fail of directing accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the cause; but are loud, violent, and tedious, in dwelling upon all circumstances which are not to the purpose.&#160; For instance, in the case already mentioned; they never desire to know what claim or title my adversary has to my cow; but whether the said cow were red or black; her horns long or short; whether the field I graze her in be round or square; whether she was milked at home or abroad; what diseases she is subject to, and the like; after which they consult precedents, adjourn the cause from time to time, and in ten, twenty, or thirty years, come to an issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is likewise to be observed, that this society has a peculiar cant and jargon of their own, that no other mortal can understand, and wherein all their laws are written, which they take special care to multiply; whereby they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood, of right and wrong; so that it will take thirty years to decide, whether the field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me, or to a stranger three hundred miles off.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state, the method is much more short and commendable: the judge first sends to sound the disposition of those in power, after which he can easily hang or save a criminal, strictly preserving all due forms of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here my master interposing, said, &#8220;it was a pity, that creatures endowed with such prodigious abilities of mind, as these lawyers, by the description I gave of them, must certainly be, were not rather encouraged to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge.&#8221;&#160; In answer to which I assured his honour, &#8220;that in all points out of their own trade, they were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us, the most despicable in common conversation, avowed enemies to all knowledge and learning, and equally disposed to pervert the general reason of mankind in every other subject of discourse as in that of their own profession.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00039">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A continuation of the state of England under Queen Anne.&#160; The character of a first minister of state in European courts.</p>
<p>My master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could incite this race of lawyers to perplex, disquiet, and weary themselves, and engage in a confederacy of injustice, merely for the sake of injuring their fellow-animals; neither could he comprehend what I meant in saying, they did it for hire.&#160; Whereupon I was at much pains to describe to him the use of money, the materials it was made of, and the value of the metals; &#8220;that when a <i>Yahoo</i> had got a great store of this precious substance, he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to; the finest clothing, the noblest houses, great tracts of land, the most costly meats and drinks, and have his choice of the most beautiful females.&#160; Therefore since money alone was able to perform all these feats, our <i>Yahoos</i> thought they could never have enough of it to spend, or to save, as they found themselves inclined, from their natural bent either to profusion or avarice; that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man&#8217;s labour, and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former; that the bulk of our people were forced to live miserably, by labouring every day for small wages, to make a few live plentifully.&#8221;</p>
<p>I enlarged myself much on these, and many other particulars to the same purpose; but his honour was still to seek; for he went upon a supposition, that all animals had a title to their share in the productions of the earth, and especially those who presided over the rest.&#160; Therefore he desired I would let him know, &#8220;what these costly meats were, and how any of us happened to want them?&#8221;&#160; Whereupon I enumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods of dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by sea to every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces and innumerable other conveniences.&#160; I assured him &#8220;that this whole globe of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better female <i>Yahoos</i> could get her breakfast, or a cup to put it in.&#8221;&#160; He said &#8220;that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its own inhabitants.&#160; But what he chiefly wondered at was, how such vast tracts of ground as I described should be wholly without fresh water, and the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink.&#8221;&#160; I replied &#8220;that England (the dear place of my nativity) was computed to produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are able to consume, as well as liquors extracted from grain, or pressed out of the fruit of certain trees, which made excellent drink, and the same proportion in every other convenience of life.&#160; But, in order to feed the luxury and intemperance of the males, and the vanity of the females, we sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries, whence, in return, we brought the materials of diseases, folly, and vice, to spend among ourselves.&#160; Hence it follows of necessity, that vast numbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging, robbing, stealing, cheating, pimping, flattering, suborning, forswearing, forging, gaming, lying, fawning, hectoring, voting, scribbling, star-gazing, poisoning, whoring, canting, libelling, freethinking, and the like occupations:&#8221; every one of which terms I was at much pains to make him understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply the want of water or other drinks, but because it was a sort of liquid which made us merry by putting us out of our senses, diverted all melancholy thoughts, begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain, raised our hopes and banished our fears, suspended every office of reason for a time, and deprived us of the use of our limbs, till we fell into a profound sleep; although it must be confessed, that we always awaked sick and dispirited; and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseases which made our lives uncomfortable and short.</p>
<p>&#8220;But beside all this, the bulk of our people supported themselves by furnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to each other.&#160; For instance, when I am at home, and dressed as I ought to be, I carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen; the building and furniture of my house employ as many more, and five times the number to adorn my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was going on to tell him of another sort of people, who get their livelihood by attending the sick, having, upon some occasions, informed his honour that many of my crew had died of diseases.&#160; But here it was with the utmost difficulty that I brought him to apprehend what I meant.&#160; &#8220;He could easily conceive, that a <i>Houyhnhnm</i>, grew weak and heavy a few days before his death, or by some accident might hurt a limb; but that nature, who works all things to perfection, should suffer any pains to breed in our bodies, he thought impossible, and desired to know the reason of so unaccountable an evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him &#8220;we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each other; that we ate when we were not hungry, and drank without the provocation of thirst; that we sat whole nights drinking strong liquors, without eating a bit, which disposed us to sloth, inflamed our bodies, and precipitated or prevented digestion; that prostitute female <i>Yahoos</i> acquired a certain malady, which bred rottenness in the bones of those who fell into their embraces; that this, and many other diseases, were propagated from father to son; so that great numbers came into the world with complicated maladies upon them; that it would be endless to give him a catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies, for they would not be fewer than five or six hundred, spread over every limb and joint&#8212;in short, every part, external and intestine, having diseases appropriated to itself.&#160; To remedy which, there was a sort of people bred up among us in the profession, or pretence, of curing the sick.&#160; And because I had some skill in the faculty, I would, in gratitude to his honour, let him know the whole mystery and method by which they proceed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their fundamental is, that all diseases arise from repletion; whence they conclude, that a great evacuation of the body is necessary, either through the natural passage or upwards at the mouth.&#160; Their next business is from herbs, minerals, gums, oils, shells, salts, juices, sea-weed, excrements, barks of trees, serpents, toads, frogs, spiders, dead men&#8217;s flesh and bones, birds, beasts, and fishes, to form a composition, for smell and taste, the most abominable, nauseous, and detestable, they can possibly contrive, which the stomach immediately rejects with loathing, and this they call a vomit; or else, from the same store-house, with some other poisonous additions, they command us to take in at the orifice above or below (just as the physician then happens to be disposed) a medicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels; which, relaxing the belly, drives down all before it; and this they call a purge, or a clyster.&#160; For nature (as the physicians allege) having intended the superior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids and liquids, and the inferior posterior for ejection, these artists ingeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of her seat, therefore, to replace her in it, the body must be treated in a manner directly contrary, by interchanging the use of each orifice; forcing solids and liquids in at the anus, and making evacuations at the mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, besides real diseases, we are subject to many that are only imaginary, for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures; these have their several names, and so have the drugs that are proper for them; and with these our female <i>Yahoos</i> are always infested.</p>
<p>&#8220;One great excellency in this tribe, is their skill at prognostics, wherein they seldom fail; their predictions in real diseases, when they rise to any degree of malignity, generally portending death, which is always in their power, when recovery is not: and therefore, upon any unexpected signs of amendment, after they have pronounced their sentence, rather than be accused as false prophets, they know how to approve their sagacity to the world, by a seasonable dose.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown weary of their mates; to eldest sons, to great ministers of state, and often to princes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had formerly, upon occasion, discoursed with my master upon the nature of government in general, and particularly of our own excellent constitution, deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world.&#160; But having here accidentally mentioned a minister of state, he commanded me, some time after, to inform him, &#8220;what species of <i>Yahoo</i> I particularly meant by that appellation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him, &#8220;that a first or chief minister of state, who was the person I intended to describe, was the creature wholly exempt from joy and grief, love and hatred, pity and anger; at least, makes use of no other passions, but a violent desire of wealth, power, and titles; that he applies his words to all uses, except to the indication of his mind; that he never tells a truth but with an intent that you should take it for a lie; nor a lie, but with a design that you should take it for a truth; that those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the surest way of preferment; and whenever he begins to praise you to others, or to yourself, you are from that day forlorn.&#160; The worst mark you can receive is a promise, especially when it is confirmed with an oath; after which, every wise man retires, and gives over all hopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are three methods, by which a man may rise to be chief minister.&#160; The first is, by knowing how, with prudence, to dispose of a wife, a daughter, or a sister; the second, by betraying or undermining his predecessor; and the third is, by a furious zeal, in public assemblies, against the corruption&#8217;s of the court.&#160; But a wise prince would rather choose to employ those who practise the last of these methods; because such zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the will and passions of their master.&#160; That these ministers, having all employments at their disposal, preserve themselves in power, by bribing the majority of a senate or great council; and at last, by an expedient, called an act of indemnity&#8221; (whereof I described the nature to him), &#8220;they secure themselves from after-reckonings, and retire from the public laden with the spoils of the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in his own trade: the pages, lackeys, and porters, by imitating their master, become ministers of state in their several districts, and learn to excel in the three principal ingredients, of insolence, lying, and bribery.&#160; Accordingly, they have a subaltern court paid to them by persons of the best rank; and sometimes by the force of dexterity and impudence, arrive, through several gradations, to be successors to their lord.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is usually governed by a decayed wench, or favourite footman, who are the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed, and may properly be called, in the last resort, the governors of the kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>One day, in discourse, my master, having heard me mention the nobility of my country, was pleased to make me a compliment which I could not pretend to deserve: &#8220;that he was sure I must have been born of some noble family, because I far exceeded in shape, colour, and cleanliness, all the <i>Yahoos</i> of his nation, although I seemed to fail in strength and agility, which must be imputed to my different way of living from those other brutes; and besides I was not only endowed with the faculty of speech, but likewise with some rudiments of reason, to a degree that, with all his acquaintance, I passed for a prodigy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made me observe, &#8220;that among the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, the white, the sorrel, and the iron-gray, were not so exactly shaped as the bay, the dapple-gray, and the black; nor born with equal talents of mind, or a capacity to improve them; and therefore continued always in the condition of servants, without ever aspiring to match out of their own race, which in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.&#8221;</p>
<p>I made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he was pleased to conceive of me, but assured him at the same time, &#8220;that my birth was of the lower sort, having been born of plain honest parents, who were just able to give me a tolerable education; that nobility, among us, was altogether a different thing from the idea he had of it; that our young noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxury; that, as soon as years will permit, they consume their vigour, and contract odious diseases among lewd females; and when their fortunes are almost ruined, they marry some woman of mean birth, disagreeable person, and unsound constitution (merely for the sake of money), whom they hate and despise.&#160; That the productions of such marriages are generally scrofulous, rickety, or deformed children; by which means the family seldom continues above three generations, unless the wife takes care to provide a healthy father, among her neighbours or domestics, in order to improve and continue the breed.&#160; That a weak diseased body, a meagre countenance, and sallow complexion, are the true marks of noble blood; and a healthy robust appearance is so disgraceful in a man of quality, that the world concludes his real father to have been a groom or a coachman.&#160; The imperfections of his mind run parallel with those of his body, being a composition of spleen, dullness, ignorance, caprice, sensuality, and pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the consent of this illustrious body, no law can be enacted, repealed, or altered: and these nobles have likewise the decision of all our possessions, without appeal.&#8221; <a id="citation514"></a><a href="gullivers-travelsinto-several-remote-nations-of-the-world-7.html#footnote514" class="citation dlinternal">[514]</a></p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00040">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author&#8217;s great love of his native country.&#160; His master&#8217;s observations upon the constitution and administration of England, as described by the author, with parallel cases and comparisons.&#160; His master&#8217;s observations upon human nature.</p>
<p>The reader may be disposed to wonder how I could prevail on myself to give so free a representation of my own species, among a race of mortals who are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of humankind, from that entire congruity between me and their <i>Yahoos</i>.&#160; But I must freely confess, that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds, placed in opposite view to human corruptions, had so far opened my eyes and enlarged my understanding, that I began to view the actions and passions of man in a very different light, and to think the honour of my own kind not worth managing; which, besides, it was impossible for me to do, before a person of so acute a judgment as my master, who daily convinced me of a thousand faults in myself, whereof I had not the least perception before, and which, with us, would never be numbered even among human infirmities.&#160; I had likewise learned, from his example, an utter detestation of all falsehood or disguise; and truth appeared so amiable to me, that I determined upon sacrificing every thing to it.</p>
<p>Let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet a much stronger motive for the freedom I took in my representation of things.&#160; I had not yet been a year in this country before I contracted such a love and veneration for the inhabitants, that I entered on a firm resolution never to return to humankind, but to pass the rest of my life among these admirable <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, in the contemplation and practice of every virtue, where I could have no example or incitement to vice.&#160; But it was decreed by fortune, my perpetual enemy, that so great a felicity should not fall to my share.&#160; However, it is now some comfort to reflect, that in what I said of my countrymen, I extenuated their faults as much as I durst before so strict an examiner; and upon every article gave as favourable a turn as the matter would bear.&#160; For, indeed, who is there alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of his birth?</p>
<p>I have related the substance of several conversations I had with my master during the greatest part of the time I had the honour to be in his service; but have, indeed, for brevity sake, omitted much more than is here set down.</p>
<p>When I had answered all his questions, and his curiosity seemed to be fully satisfied, he sent for me one morning early, and commanded me to sit down at some distance (an honour which he had never before conferred upon me).&#160; He said, &#8220;he had been very seriously considering my whole story, as far as it related both to myself and my country; that he looked upon us as a sort of animals, to whose share, by what accident he could not conjecture, some small pittance of reason had fallen, whereof we made no other use, than by its assistance, to aggravate our natural corruptions, and to acquire new ones, which nature had not given us; that we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed; had been very successful in multiplying our original wants, and seemed to spend our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions; that, as to myself, it was manifest I had neither the strength nor agility of a common <i>Yahoo</i>; that I walked infirmly on my hinder feet; had found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence, and to remove the hair from my chin, which was intended as a shelter from the sun and the weather: lastly, that I could neither run with speed, nor climb trees like my brethren,&#8221; as he called them, &#8220;the <i>Yahoos</i> in his country.</p>
<p>&#8220;That our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our gross defects in reason, and by consequence in virtue; because reason alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was, therefore, a character we had no pretence to challenge, even from the account I had given of my own people; although he manifestly perceived, that, in order to favour them, I had concealed many particulars, and often said the thing which was not.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the more confirmed in this opinion, because, he observed, that as I agreed in every feature of my body with other <i>Yahoos</i>, except where it was to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed, and activity, the shortness of my claws, and some other particulars where nature had no part; so from the representation I had given him of our lives, our manners, and our actions, he found as near a resemblance in the disposition of our minds.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;the <i>Yahoos</i> were known to hate one another, more than they did any different species of animals; and the reason usually assigned was, the odiousness of their own shapes, which all could see in the rest, but not in themselves.&#160; He had therefore begun to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies, and by that invention conceal many of our deformities from each other, which would else be hardly supportable.&#160; But he now found he had been mistaken, and that the dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause with ours, as I had described them.&#160; For if,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you throw among five <i>Yahoos</i> as much food as would be sufficient for fifty, they will, instead of eating peaceably, fall together by the ears, each single one impatient to have all to itself; and therefore a servant was usually employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at home were tied at a distance from each other: that if a cow died of age or accident, before a <i>Houyhnhnm</i> could secure it for his own <i>Yahoos</i>, those in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it, and then would ensue such a battle as I had described, with terrible wounds made by their claws on both sides, although they seldom were able to kill one another, for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had invented.&#160; At other times, the like battles have been fought between the <i>Yahoos</i> of several neighbourhoods, without any visible cause; those of one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next, before they are prepared.&#160; But if they find their project has miscarried, they return home, and, for want of enemies, engage in what I call a civil war among themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;That in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of several colours, whereof the <i>Yahoos</i> are violently fond: and when part of these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes happens, they will dig with their claws for whole days to get them out; then carry them away, and hide them by heaps in their kennels; but still looking round with great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their treasure.&#8221;&#160; My master said, &#8220;he could never discover the reason of this unnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a <i>Yahoo</i>; but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice which I had ascribed to mankind.&#160; That he had once, by way of experiment, privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his <i>Yahoos</i> had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal, missing his treasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place, there miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the rest, began to pine away, would neither eat, nor sleep, nor work, till he ordered a servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole, and hide them as before; which, when his <i>Yahoo</i> had found, he presently recovered his spirits and good humour, but took good care to remove them to a better hiding place, and has ever since been a very serviceable brute.&#8221;</p>
<p>My master further assured me, which I also observed myself, &#8220;that in the fields where the shining stones abound, the fiercest and most frequent battles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring <i>Yahoos</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;it was common, when two <i>Yahoos</i> discovered such a stone in a field, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a third would take the advantage, and carry it away from them both;&#8221; which my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our suits at law; wherein I thought it for our credit not to undeceive him; since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees among us; because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside the stone they contended for: whereas our courts of equity would never have dismissed the cause, while either of them had any thing left.</p>
<p>My master, continuing his discourse, said, &#8220;there was nothing that rendered the <i>Yahoos</i> more odious, than their undistinguishing appetite to devour every thing that came in their way, whether herbs, roots, berries, the corrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together: and it was peculiar in their temper, that they were fonder of what they could get by rapine or stealth, at a greater distance, than much better food provided for them at home.&#160; If their prey held out, they would eat till they were ready to burst; after which, nature had pointed out to them a certain root that gave them a general evacuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was also another kind of root, very juicy, but somewhat rare and difficult to be found, which the <i>Yahoos</i> sought for with much eagerness, and would suck it with great delight; it produced in them the same effects that wine has upon us.&#160; It would make them sometimes hug, and sometimes tear one another; they would howl, and grin, and chatter, and reel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the mud.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did indeed observe that the <i>Yahoos</i> were the only animals in this country subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than horses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they meet with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.&#160; Neither has their language any more than a general appellation for those maladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and called <i>hnea-yahoo</i>, or <i>Yahoo&#8217;s evil</i>; and the cure prescribed is a mixture of their own dung and urine, forcibly put down the <i>Yahoo&#8217;s</i> throat.&#160; This I have since often known to have been taken with success, and do here freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good, as an admirable specific against all diseases produced by repletion.</p>
<p>&#8220;As to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,&#8221; my master confessed, &#8220;he could find little or no resemblance between the <i>Yahoos</i> of that country and those in ours; for he only meant to observe what parity there was in our natures.&#160; He had heard, indeed, some curious <i>Houyhnhnms</i> observe, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling <i>Yahoo</i> (as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in a park), who was always more deformed in body, and mischievous in disposition, than any of the rest; that this leader had usually a favourite as like himself as he could get, whose employment was to lick his master&#8217;s feet and posteriors, and drive the female <i>Yahoos</i> to his kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of ass&#8217;s flesh.&#160; This favourite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore, to protect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader.&#160; He usually continues in office till a worse can be found; but the very moment he is discarded, his successor, at the head of all the <i>Yahoos</i> in that district, young and old, male and female, come in a body, and discharge their excrements upon him from head to foot.&#160; But how far this might be applicable to our courts, and favourites, and ministers of state, my master said I could best determine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I durst make no return to this malicious insinuation, which debased human understanding below the sagacity of a common hound, who has judgment enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack, without being ever mistaken.</p>
<p>My master told me, &#8220;there were some qualities remarkable in the <i>Yahoos</i>, which he had not observed me to mention, or at least very slightly, in the accounts I had given of humankind.&#8221;&#160; He said, &#8220;those animals, like other brutes, had their females in common; but in this they differed, that the she <i>Yahoo</i> would admit the males while she was pregnant; and that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females, as fiercely as with each other; both which practices were such degrees of infamous brutality, as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another thing he wondered at in the <i>Yahoos</i>, was their strange disposition to nastiness and dirt; whereas there appears to be a natural love of cleanliness in all other animals.&#8221;&#160; As to the two former accusations, I was glad to let them pass without any reply, because I had not a word to offer upon them in defence of my species, which otherwise I certainly had done from my own inclinations.&#160; But I could have easily vindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the last article, if there had been any swine in that country (as unluckily for me there were not), which, although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a <i>Yahoo</i>, cannot, I humbly conceive, in justice, pretend to more cleanliness; and so his honour himself must have owned, if he had seen their filthy way of feeding, and their custom of wallowing and sleeping in the mud.</p>
<p>My master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had discovered in several Yahoos, and to him was wholly unaccountable.&#160; He said, &#8220;a fancy would sometimes take a <i>Yahoo</i> to retire into a corner, to lie down, and howl, and groan, and spurn away all that came near him, although he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water, nor did the servant imagine what could possibly ail him.&#160; And the only remedy they found was, to set him to hard work, after which he would infallibly come to himself.&#8221;&#160; To this I was silent out of partiality to my own kind; yet here I could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen, which only seizes on the lazy, the luxurious, and the rich; who, if they were forced to undergo the same regimen, I would undertake for the cure.</p>
<p>His honour had further observed, &#8220;that a female <i>Yahoo</i> would often stand behind a bank or a bush, to gaze on the young males passing by, and then appear, and hide, using many antic gestures and grimaces, at which time it was observed that she had a most offensive smell; and when any of the males advanced, would slowly retire, looking often back, and with a counterfeit show of fear, run off into some convenient place, where she knew the male would follow her.</p>
<p>&#8220;At other times, if a female stranger came among them, three or four of her own sex would get about her, and stare, and chatter, and grin, and smell her all over; and then turn off with gestures, that seemed to express contempt and disdain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations, which he had drawn from what he observed himself, or had been told him by others; however, I could not reflect without some amazement, and much sorrow, that the rudiments of lewdness, coquetry, censure, and scandal, should have place by instinct in womankind.</p>
<p>I expected every moment that my master would accuse the <i>Yahoos</i> of those unnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us.&#160; But nature, it seems, has not been so expert a school-mistress; and these politer pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of the globe.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00041">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The author relates several particulars of the <i>Yahoos</i>.&#160; The great virtues of the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>.&#160; The education and exercise of their youth.&#160; Their general assembly.</p>
<p>As I ought to have understood human nature much better than I supposed it possible for my master to do, so it was easy to apply the character he gave of the <i>Yahoos</i> to myself and my countrymen; and I believed I could yet make further discoveries, from my own observation.&#160; I therefore often begged his honour to let me go among the herds of <i>Yahoos</i> in the neighbourhood; to which he always very graciously consented, being perfectly convinced that the hatred I bore these brutes would never suffer me to be corrupted by them; and his honour ordered one of his servants, a strong sorrel nag, very honest and good-natured, to be my guard; without whose protection I durst not undertake such adventures.&#160; For I have already told the reader how much I was pestered by these odious animals, upon my first arrival; and I afterwards failed very narrowly, three or four times, of falling into their clutches, when I happened to stray at any distance without my hanger.&#160; And I have reason to believe they had some imagination that I was of their own species, which I often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves, and showing my naked arms and breasts in their sight, when my protector was with me.&#160; At which times they would approach as near as they durst, and imitate my actions after the manner of monkeys, but ever with great signs of hatred; as a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild ones, when he happens to be got among them.</p>
<p>They are prodigiously nimble from their infancy.&#160; However, I once caught a young male of three years old, and endeavoured, by all marks of tenderness, to make it quiet; but the little imp fell a squalling, and scratching, and biting with such violence, that I was forced to let it go; and it was high time, for a whole troop of old ones came about us at the noise, but finding the cub was safe (for away it ran), and my sorrel nag being by, they durst not venture near us.&#160; I observed the young animal&#8217;s flesh to smell very rank, and the stink was somewhat between a weasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable.&#160; I forgot another circumstance (and perhaps I might have the reader&#8217;s pardon if it were wholly omitted), that while I held the odious vermin in my hands, it voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my clothes; but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by, where I washed myself as clean as I could; although I durst not come into my master&#8217;s presence until I were sufficiently aired.</p>
<p>By what I could discover, the <i>Yahoos</i> appear to be the most unteachable of all animals: their capacity never reaching higher than to draw or carry burdens.&#160; Yet I am of opinion, this defect arises chiefly from a perverse, restive disposition; for they are cunning, malicious, treacherous, and revengeful.&#160; They are strong and hardy, but of a cowardly spirit, and, by consequence, insolent, abject, and cruel.&#160; It is observed, that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity.</p>
<p>The <i>Houyhnhnms</i> keep the <i>Yahoos</i> for present use in huts not far from the house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields, where they dig up roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search about for carrion, or sometimes catch weasels and <i>luhimuhs</i> (a sort of wild rat), which they greedily devour.&#160; Nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their nails on the side of a rising ground, wherein they lie by themselves; only the kennels of the females are larger, sufficient to hold two or three cubs.</p>
<p>They swim from their infancy like frogs, and are able to continue long under water, where they often take fish, which the females carry home to their young.&#160; And, upon this occasion, I hope the reader will pardon my relating an odd adventure.</p>
<p>Being one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag, and the weather exceeding hot, I entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was near.&#160; He consented, and I immediately stripped myself stark naked, and went down softly into the stream.&#160; It happened that a young female <i>Yahoo</i>, standing behind a bank, saw the whole proceeding, and inflamed by desire, as the nag and I conjectured, came running with all speed, and leaped into the water, within five yards of the place where I bathed.&#160; I was never in my life so terribly frightened.&#160; The nag was grazing at some distance, not suspecting any harm.&#160; She embraced me after a most fulsome manner.&#160; I roared as loud as I could, and the nag came galloping towards me, whereupon she quitted her grasp, with the utmost reluctancy, and leaped upon the opposite bank, where she stood gazing and howling all the time I was putting on my clothes.</p>
<p>This was a matter of diversion to my master and his family, as well as of mortification to myself.&#160; For now I could no longer deny that I was a real <i>Yahoo</i> in every limb and feature, since the females had a natural propensity to me, as one of their own species.&#160; Neither was the hair of this brute of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular), but black as a sloe, and her countenance did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind; for I think she could not be above eleven years old.</p>
<p>Having lived three years in this country, the reader, I suppose, will expect that I should, like other travellers, give him some account of the manners and customs of its inhabitants, which it was indeed my principal study to learn.</p>
<p>As these noble <i>Houyhnhnms</i> are endowed by nature with a general disposition to all virtues, and have no conceptions or ideas of what is evil in a rational creature, so their grand maxim is, to cultivate reason, and to be wholly governed by it.&#160; Neither is reason among them a point problematical, as with us, where men can argue with plausibility on both sides of the question, but strikes you with immediate conviction; as it must needs do, where it is not mingled, obscured, or discoloured, by passion and interest.&#160; I remember it was with extreme difficulty that I could bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion, or how a point could be disputable; because reason taught us to affirm or deny only where we are certain; and beyond our knowledge we cannot do either.&#160; So that controversies, wranglings, disputes, and positiveness, in false or dubious propositions, are evils unknown among the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>.&#160; In the like manner, when I used to explain to him our several systems of natural philosophy, he would laugh, &#8220;that a creature pretending to reason, should value itself upon the knowledge of other people&#8217;s conjectures, and in things where that knowledge, if it were certain, could be of no use.&#8221;&#160; Wherein he agreed entirely with the sentiments of Socrates, as Plato delivers them; which I mention as the highest honour I can do that prince of philosophers.&#160; I have often since reflected, what destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries of Europe; and how many paths of fame would be then shut up in the learned world.</p>
<p>Friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>; and these not confined to particular objects, but universal to the whole race; for a stranger from the remotest part is equally treated with the nearest neighbour, and wherever he goes, looks upon himself as at home.&#160; They preserve decency and civility in the highest degrees, but are altogether ignorant of ceremony.&#160; They have no fondness for their colts or foals, but the care they take in educating them proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason.&#160; And I observed my master to show the same affection to his neighbour&#8217;s issue, that he had for his own.&#160; They will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole species, and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons, where there is a superior degree of virtue.</p>
<p>When the matron <i>Houyhnhnms</i> have produced one of each sex, they no longer accompany with their consorts, except they lose one of their issue by some casualty, which very seldom happens; but in such a case they meet again; or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is past bearing, some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts, and then go together again until the mother is pregnant.&#160; This caution is necessary, to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers.&#160; But the race of inferior <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, bred up to be servants, is not so strictly limited upon this article: these are allowed to produce three of each sex, to be domestics in the noble families.</p>
<p>In their marriages, they are exactly careful to choose such colours as will not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed.&#160; Strength is chiefly valued in the male, and comeliness in the female; not upon the account of love, but to preserve the race from degenerating; for where a female happens to excel in strength, a consort is chosen, with regard to comeliness.</p>
<p>Courtship, love, presents, jointures, settlements have no place in their thoughts, or terms whereby to express them in their language.&#160; The young couple meet, and are joined, merely because it is the determination of their parents and friends; it is what they see done every day, and they look upon it as one of the necessary actions of a reasonable being.&#160; But the violation of marriage, or any other unchastity, was never heard of; and the married pair pass their lives with the same friendship and mutual benevolence, that they bear to all others of the same species who come in their way, without jealousy, fondness, quarrelling, or discontent.</p>
<p>In educating the youth of both sexes, their method is admirable, and highly deserves our imitation.&#160; These are not suffered to taste a grain of oats, except upon certain days, till eighteen years old; nor milk, but very rarely; and in summer they graze two hours in the morning, and as many in the evening, which their parents likewise observe; but the servants are not allowed above half that time, and a great part of their grass is brought home, which they eat at the most convenient hours, when they can be best spared from work.</p>
<p>Temperance, industry, exercise, and cleanliness, are the lessons equally enjoined to the young ones of both sexes: and my master thought it monstrous in us, to give the females a different kind of education from the males, except in some articles of domestic management; whereby, as he truly observed, one half of our natives were good for nothing but bringing children into the world; and to trust the care of our children to such useless animals, he said, was yet a greater instance of brutality.</p>
<p>But the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> train up their youth to strength, speed, and hardiness, by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills, and over hard stony grounds; and when they are all in a sweat, they are ordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river.&#160; Four times a year the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in running and leaping, and other feats of strength and agility; where the victor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise.&#160; On this festival, the servants drive a herd of <i>Yahoos</i> into the field, laden with hay, and oats, and milk, for a repast to the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>; after which, these brutes are immediately driven back again, for fear of being noisome to the assembly.</p>
<p>Every fourth year, at the vernal equinox, there is a representative council of the whole nation, which meets in a plain about twenty miles from our house, and continues about five or six days.&#160; Here they inquire into the state and condition of the several districts; whether they abound or be deficient in hay or oats, or cows, or <i>Yahoos</i>; and wherever there is any want (which is but seldom) it is immediately supplied by unanimous consent and contribution.&#160; Here likewise the regulation of children is settled: as for instance, if a <i>Houyhnhnm</i> has two males, he changes one of them with another that has two females; and when a child has been lost by any casualty, where the mother is past breeding, it is determined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the loss.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00042">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A grand debate at the general assembly of the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, and how it was determined.&#160; The learning of the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>.&#160; Their buildings.&#160; Their manner of burials.&#160; The defectiveness of their language.</p>
<p>One of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months before my departure, whither my master went as the representative of our district.&#160; In this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the only debate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master, after his return, give me a very particular account.</p>
<p>The question to be debated was, &#8220;whether the <i>Yahoos</i> should be exterminated from the face of the earth?&#8221;&#160; One of the members for the affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight, alleging, &#8220;that as the <i>Yahoos</i> were the most filthy, noisome, and deformed animals which nature ever produced, so they were the most restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious; they would privately suck the teats of the <i>Houyhnhnms&#8217;</i> cows, kill and devour their cats, trample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually watched, and commit a thousand other extravagancies.&#8221;&#160; He took notice of a general tradition, &#8220;that <i>Yahoos</i> had not been always in their country; but that many ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain; whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime, or from the ooze and froth of the sea, was never known; that these <i>Yahoos</i> engendered, and their brood, in a short time, grew so numerous as to overrun and infest the whole nation; that the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, to get rid of this evil, made a general hunting, and at last enclosed the whole herd; and destroying the elder, every <i>Houyhnhnm</i> kept two young ones in a kennel, and brought them to such a degree of tameness, as an animal, so savage by nature, can be capable of acquiring, using them for draught and carriage; that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition, and that those creatures could not be <i>yinhniamshy</i> (or <i>aborigines</i> of the land), because of the violent hatred the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, as well as all other animals, bore them, which, although their evil disposition sufficiently deserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been <i>aborigines</i>, or else they would have long since been rooted out; that the inhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the <i>Yahoos</i>, had, very imprudently, neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are a comely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any offensive smell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the other in agility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound, it is far preferable to the horrible howlings of the <i>Yahoos</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my master proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed borrowed the hint from me.&#160; &#8220;He approved of the tradition mentioned by the honourable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two <i>Yahoos</i> said to be seen first among them, had been driven thither over the sea; that coming to land, and being forsaken by their companions, they retired to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the country whence these two originals came.&#160; The reason of this assertion was, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful <i>Yahoo</i> (meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of them had seen.&#160; He then related to them how he first found me; that my body was all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other animals; that I spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned theirs; that I had related to him the accidents which brought me thither; that when he saw me without my covering, I was an exact <i>Yahoo</i> in every part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws.&#160; He added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other countries, the <i>Yahoos</i> acted as the governing, rational animal, and held the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities of a <i>Yahoo</i>, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason, which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the <i>Houyhnhnm</i> race, as the <i>Yahoos</i> of their country were to me; that, among other things, I mentioned a custom we had of castrating <i>Houyhnhnms</i> when they were young, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and safe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant, and building by the swallow (for so I translate the word <i>lyhannh</i>, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention might be practised upon the younger <i>Yahoos</i> here, which besides rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end to the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which, as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this advantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others are not till twelve.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was all my master thought fit to tell me, at that time, of what passed in the grand council.&#160; But he was pleased to conceal one particular, which related personally to myself, whereof I soon felt the unhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper place, and whence I date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life.</p>
<p>The <i>Houyhnhnms</i> have no letters, and consequently their knowledge is all traditional.&#160; But there happening few events of any moment among a people so well united, naturally disposed to every virtue, wholly governed by reason, and cut off from all commerce with other nations, the historical part is easily preserved without burdening their memories.&#160; I have already observed that they are subject to no diseases, and therefore can have no need of physicians.&#160; However, they have excellent medicines, composed of herbs, to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or frog of the foot, by sharp stones, as well as other maims and hurts in the several parts of the body.</p>
<p>They calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon, but use no subdivisions into weeks.&#160; They are well enough acquainted with the motions of those two luminaries, and understand the nature of eclipses; and this is the utmost progress of their astronomy.</p>
<p>In poetry, they must be allowed to excel all other mortals; wherein the justness of their similes, and the minuteness as well as exactness of their descriptions, are indeed inimitable.&#160; Their verses abound very much in both of these, and usually contain either some exalted notions of friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in races and other bodily exercises.&#160; Their buildings, although very rude and simple, are not inconvenient, but well contrived to defend them from all injuries of cold and heat.&#160; They have a kind of tree, which at forty years old loosens in the root, and falls with the first storm: it grows very straight, and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone (for the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> know not the use of iron), they stick them erect in the ground, about ten inches asunder, and then weave in oat straw, or sometimes wattles, between them.&#160; The roof is made after the same manner, and so are the doors.</p>
<p>The <i>Houyhnhnms</i> use the hollow part, between the pastern and the hoof of their fore-foot, as we do our hands, and this with greater dexterity than I could at first imagine.&#160; I have seen a white mare of our family thread a needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that joint.&#160; They milk their cows, reap their oats, and do all the work which requires hands, in the same manner.&#160; They have a kind of hard flints, which, by grinding against other stones, they form into instruments, that serve instead of wedges, axes, and hammers.&#160; With tools made of these flints, they likewise cut their hay, and reap their oats, which there grow naturally in several fields; the <i>Yahoos</i> draw home the sheaves in carriages, and the servants tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain, which is kept in stores.&#160; They make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels, and bake the former in the sun.</p>
