<h2 id="id02653">CHAPTER 8</h2>

<h6 id="id02654">The Bay of Vigo</h6>

<p id="id02655">THE ATLANTIC!  A vast expanse of water whose surface area is 25,000,000
square miles, with a length of 9,000 miles and an average width
of 2,700. A major sea nearly unknown to the ancients, except perhaps
the Carthaginians, those Dutchmen of antiquity who went along
the west coasts of Europe and Africa on their commercial junkets!
An ocean whose parallel winding shores form an immense perimeter
fed by the world's greatest rivers:  the St. Lawrence, Mississippi,
Amazon, Plata, Orinoco, Niger, Senegal, Elbe, Loire, and Rhine,
which bring it waters from the most civilized countries as well
as the most undeveloped areas!  A magnificent plain of waves plowed
continuously by ships of every nation, shaded by every flag in the world,
and ending in those two dreadful headlands so feared by navigators,
Cape Horn and the Cape of Tempests!</p>

<p id="id02656">The Nautilus broke these waters with the edge of its spur after
doing nearly 10,000 leagues in three and a half months, a track
longer than a great circle of the earth.  Where were we heading now,
and what did the future have in store for us?</p>

<p id="id02657">Emerging from the Strait of Gibraltar, the Nautilus took to the
high seas.  It returned to the surface of the waves, so our daily
strolls on the platform were restored to us.</p>

<p id="id02658">I climbed onto it instantly, Ned Land and Conseil along with me.
Twelve miles away, Cape St. Vincent was hazily visible, the southwestern
tip of the Hispanic peninsula.  The wind was blowing a pretty
strong gust from the south.  The sea was swelling and surging.
Its waves made the Nautilus roll and jerk violently.
It was nearly impossible to stand up on the platform,
which was continuously buffeted by this enormously heavy sea.
After inhaling a few breaths of air, we went below once more.</p>

<p id="id02659">I repaired to my stateroom.  Conseil returned to his cabin;
but the Canadian, looking rather worried, followed me.  Our quick
trip through the Mediterranean hadn't allowed him to put his plans
into execution, and he could barely conceal his disappointment.</p>

<p id="id02660">After the door to my stateroom was closed, he sat and stared
at me silently.</p>

<p id="id02661">"Ned my friend," I told him, "I know how you feel, but you mustn't
blame yourself.  Given the way the Nautilus was navigating,
it would have been sheer insanity to think of escaping!"</p>

<p id="id02662">Ned Land didn't reply.  His pursed lips and frowning brow indicated
that he was in the grip of his monomania.</p>

<p id="id02663">"Look here," I went on, "as yet there's no cause for despair.
We're going up the coast of Portugal.  France and England aren't
far off, and there we'll easily find refuge.  Oh, I grant you,
if the Nautilus had emerged from the Strait of Gibraltar and made
for that cape in the south, if it were taking us toward those
regions that have no continents, then I'd share your alarm.
But we now know that Captain Nemo doesn't avoid the seas of civilization,
and in a few days I think we can safely take action."</p>

<p id="id02664">Ned Land stared at me still more intently and finally unpursed his lips:</p>

<p id="id02665">"We'll do it this evening," he said.</p>

<p id="id02666">I straightened suddenly.  I admit that I was less than ready
for this announcement.  I wanted to reply to the Canadian,
but words failed me.</p>

<p id="id02667">"We agreed to wait for the right circumstances," Ned Land went on.<br/>

"Now we've got those circumstances.  This evening we'll be just<br/>

a few miles off the coast of Spain.  It'll be cloudy tonight.<br/>

The wind's blowing toward shore.  You gave me your promise,<br/>

Professor Aronnax, and I'm counting on you."<br/></p>

<p id="id02668">Since I didn't say anything, the Canadian stood up and approached me:</p>

<p id="id02669">"We'll do it this evening at nine o'clock," he said.
"I've alerted Conseil.  By that time Captain Nemo will be locked in his
room and probably in bed.  Neither the mechanics or the crewmen will be
able to see us.  Conseil and I will go to the central companionway.
As for you, Professor Aronnax, you'll stay in the library two
steps away and wait for my signal.  The oars, mast, and sail are
in the skiff.  I've even managed to stow some provisions inside.
I've gotten hold of a monkey wrench to unscrew the nuts bolting
the skiff to the Nautilus's hull.  So everything's ready.
I'll see you this evening."</p>

<p id="id02670">"The sea is rough," I said.</p>

<p id="id02671">"Admitted," the Canadian replied, "but we've got to risk it.
Freedom is worth paying for.  Besides, the longboat's solidly built,
and a few miles with the wind behind us is no big deal.
By tomorrow, who knows if this ship won't be 100 leagues out to sea?
If circumstances are in our favor, between ten and eleven this evening
we'll be landing on some piece of solid ground, or we'll be dead.
So we're in God's hands, and I'll see you this evening!"</p>

<p id="id02672">This said, the Canadian withdrew, leaving me close to dumbfounded.
I had imagined that if it came to this, I would have time to think
about it, to talk it over.  My stubborn companion hadn't granted
me this courtesy.  But after all, what would I have said to him?
Ned Land was right a hundred times over.  These were near-ideal
circumstances, and he was taking full advantage of them.
In my selfish personal interests, could I go back on my word
and be responsible for ruining the future lives of my companions?
Tomorrow, might not Captain Nemo take us far away from any shore?</p>

<p id="id02673">Just then a fairly loud hissing told me that the ballast tanks
were filling, and the Nautilus sank beneath the waves of the Atlantic.</p>

<p id="id02674">I stayed in my stateroom.  I wanted to avoid the captain, to hide from
his eyes the agitation overwhelming me.  What an agonizing day I spent,
torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning
this marvelous Nautilus, leaving my underwater research incomplete!
How could I relinquish this ocean&#8212;"my own Atlantic," as I liked
to call it&#8212;without observing its lower strata, without wresting
from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas
of the East Indies and the Pacific!  I was putting down my novel
half read, I was waking up as my dream neared its climax!
How painfully the hours passed, as I sometimes envisioned myself
safe on shore with my companions, or, despite my better judgment,
as I sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would
prevent Ned Land from carrying out his plans.</p>

<p id="id02675">Twice I went to the lounge.  I wanted to consult the compass.
I wanted to see if the Nautilus's heading was actually taking
us closer to the coast or spiriting us farther away.  But no.
The Nautilus was still in Portuguese waters.  Heading north,
it was cruising along the ocean's beaches.</p>

<p id="id02676">So I had to resign myself to my fate and get ready to escape.<br/>

My baggage wasn't heavy.  My notes, nothing more.<br/></p>

<p id="id02677">As for Captain Nemo, I wondered what he would make of our escaping,
what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him, and what
he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being
found out!  Certainly I had no complaints to register with him,
on the contrary.  Never was hospitality more wholehearted than his.
Yet in leaving him I couldn't be accused of ingratitude.
No solemn promises bound us to him.  In order to keep us captive,
he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our
word of honor.  But his avowed intention to imprison us forever
on his ship justified our every effort.</p>

<p id="id02678">I hadn't seen the captain since our visit to the island of Santorini.<br/>

Would fate bring me into his presence before our departure?<br/>

I both desired and dreaded it.  I listened for footsteps<br/>

in the stateroom adjoining mine.  Not a sound reached my ear.<br/>

His stateroom had to be deserted.<br/></p>

<p id="id02679">Then I began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on board.
Since that night when the skiff had left the Nautilus on some
mysterious mission, my ideas about him had subtly changed.
In spite of everything, I thought that Captain Nemo must
have kept up some type of relationship with the shore.
Did he himself never leave the Nautilus?  Whole weeks had often gone
by without my encountering him.  What was he doing all the while?
During all those times I'd thought he was convalescing in the grip
of some misanthropic fit, was he instead far away from the ship,
involved in some secret activity whose nature still eluded me?</p>

<p id="id02680">All these ideas and a thousand others assaulted me at the same time.<br/>

In these strange circumstances the scope for conjecture was unlimited.<br/>

I felt an unbearable queasiness.  This day of waiting seemed endless.<br/>

The hours struck too slowly to keep up with my impatience.<br/></p>

<p id="id02681">As usual, dinner was served me in my stateroom.  Full of anxiety,
I ate little.  I left the table at seven o'clock. 120 minutes&#8212;
I was keeping track of them&#8212;still separated me from the
moment I was to rejoin Ned Land.  My agitation increased.
My pulse was throbbing violently.  I couldn't stand still.
I walked up and down, hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement.
The possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least
of my worries; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans
might be discovered before we had left the Nautilus, at the thought
of being hauled in front of Captain Nemo and finding him angered,
or worse, saddened by my deserting him.</p>

<p id="id02682">I wanted to see the lounge one last time.  I went down the gangways
and arrived at the museum where I had spent so many pleasant and
productive hours.  I stared at all its wealth, all its treasures, like a
man on the eve of his eternal exile, a man departing to return no more.
For so many days now, these natural wonders and artistic masterworks had
been central to my life, and I was about to leave them behind forever.
I wanted to plunge my eyes through the lounge window and into
these Atlantic waters; but the panels were hermetically sealed,
and a mantle of sheet iron separated me from this ocean with which I
was still unfamiliar.</p>

<p id="id02683">Crossing through the lounge, I arrived at the door, contrived in one<br/>

of the canted corners, that opened into the captain's stateroom.<br/>

Much to my astonishment, this door was ajar.  I instinctively recoiled.<br/>

If Captain Nemo was in his stateroom, he might see me.<br/>

But, not hearing any sounds, I approached.  The stateroom was deserted.<br/>

I pushed the door open.  I took a few steps inside.<br/>

Still the same austere, monastic appearance.<br/></p>

<p id="id02684">Just then my eye was caught by some etchings hanging
on the wall, which I hadn't noticed during my first visit.  They were
portraits of great men of history who had spent their lives in
perpetual devotion to a great human ideal: Thaddeus Kosciusko, the
hero whose dying words had been Finis Poloniae;<a id="noteref-5b"
href="twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-seas-18.html#note-5b">[5]</a>
Markos Botzaris, for modern Greece the reincarnation of Sparta's King
Leonidas; Daniel O'Connell, Ireland's defender; George Washington,
founder of the American Union; Daniele Manin, the Italian patriot;
Abraham Lincoln, dead from the bullet of a believer in slavery; and
finally, that martyr for the redemption of the black race, John Brown,
hanging from his gallows as Victor Hugo's pencil has so terrifyingly
depicted.</p>

<p id="id02686">What was the bond between these heroic souls and the soul
of Captain Nemo?  From this collection of portraits could I
finally unravel the mystery of his existence?  Was he a fighter
for oppressed peoples, a liberator of enslaved races?  Had he figured
in the recent political or social upheavals of this century?
Was he a hero of that dreadful civil war in America, a war lamentable
yet forever glorious . . . ?</p>

<p id="id02687">Suddenly the clock struck eight.  The first stroke of its hammer
on the chime snapped me out of my musings.  I shuddered as if some
invisible eye had plunged into my innermost thoughts, and I rushed
outside the stateroom.</p>

<p id="id02688">There my eyes fell on the compass.  Our heading was still northerly.
The log indicated a moderate speed, the pressure gauge a depth of about
sixty feet.  So circumstances were in favor of the Canadian's plans.</p>

<p id="id02689">I stayed in my stateroom.  I dressed warmly:  fishing boots, otter cap,
coat of fan-mussel fabric lined with sealskin.  I was ready.
I was waiting.  Only the propeller's vibrations disturbed the deep
silence reigning on board.  I cocked an ear and listened.
Would a sudden outburst of voices tell me that Ned Land's escape plans
had just been detected?  A ghastly uneasiness stole through me.
I tried in vain to recover my composure.</p>

<p id="id02690">A few minutes before nine o'clock, I glued my ear to the captain's door.
Not a sound.  I left my stateroom and returned to the lounge,
which was deserted and plunged in near darkness.</p>

<p id="id02691">I opened the door leading to the library.  The same inadequate light,
the same solitude.  I went to man my post near the door opening into
the well of the central companionway.  I waited for Ned Land's signal.</p>

<p id="id02692">At this point the propeller's vibrations slowed down appreciably,
then they died out altogether.  Why was the Nautilus stopping?
Whether this layover would help or hinder Ned Land's schemes I
couldn't have said.</p>

<p id="id02693">The silence was further disturbed only by the pounding of my heart.</p>

<p id="id02694">Suddenly I felt a mild jolt.  I realized the Nautilus had come
to rest on the ocean floor.  My alarm increased.  The Canadian's
signal hadn't reached me.  I longed to rejoin Ned Land and urge him
to postpone his attempt.  I sensed that we were no longer navigating
under normal conditions.</p>

<p id="id02695">Just then the door to the main lounge opened and Captain Nemo appeared.<br/>

He saw me, and without further preamble:<br/></p>

<p id="id02696">"Ah, professor," he said in an affable tone, "I've been looking for you.<br/>

Do you know your Spanish history?"<br/></p>

<p id="id02697">Even if he knew it by heart, a man in my disturbed, befuddled condition
couldn't have quoted a syllable of his own country's history.</p>

<p id="id02698">"Well?"  Captain Nemo went on.  "Did you hear my question?<br/>

Do you know the history of Spain?"<br/></p>

<p id="id02699">"Very little of it," I replied.</p>

<p id="id02700">"The most learned men," the captain said, "still have much to learn.
Have a seat," he added, "and I'll tell you about an unusual episode
in this body of history."</p>

<p id="id02701">The captain stretched out on a couch, and I mechanically took a seat
near him, but half in the shadows.</p>

<p id="id02702">"Professor," he said, "listen carefully.  This piece of history
concerns you in one definite respect, because it will answer
a question you've no doubt been unable to resolve."</p>

<p id="id02703">"I'm listening, captain," I said, not knowing what my partner
in this dialogue was driving at, and wondering if this incident
related to our escape plans.</p>

<p id="id02704">"Professor," Captain Nemo went on, "if you're amenable, we'll go
back in time to 1702.  You're aware of the fact that in those days
your King Louis XIV thought an imperial gesture would suffice
to humble the Pyrenees in the dust, so he inflicted his grandson,
the Duke of Anjou, on the Spaniards.  Reigning more or less
poorly under the name King Philip V, this aristocrat had to deal
with mighty opponents abroad.</p>

<p id="id02705">"In essence, the year before, the royal houses of Holland, Austria,
and England had signed a treaty of alliance at The Hague, aiming to
wrest the Spanish crown from King Philip V and to place it on the head
of an archduke whom they prematurely dubbed King Charles III.</p>

<p id="id02706">"Spain had to withstand these allies.  But the country had practically no
army or navy.  Yet it wasn't short of money, provided that its galleons,
laden with gold and silver from America, could enter its ports.
Now then, late in 1702 Spain was expecting a rich convoy,
which France ventured to escort with a fleet of twenty-three vessels
under the command of Admiral de Chateau-Renault, because by that time
the allied navies were roving the Atlantic.</p>

<p id="id02707">"This convoy was supposed to put into Cadiz, but after learning
that the English fleet lay across those waterways, the admiral
decided to make for a French port.</p>

<p id="id02708">"The Spanish commanders in the convoy objected to this decision.
They wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, if not to Cadiz,
then to the Bay of Vigo, located on Spain's northwest coast
and not blockaded.</p>

<p id="id02709">"Admiral de Chateau-Renault was so indecisive as to obey this directive,
and the galleons entered the Bay of Vigo.</p>

<p id="id02710">"Unfortunately this bay forms an open, offshore mooring that's
impossible to defend.  So it was essential to hurry and empty
the galleons before the allied fleets arrived, and there would
have been ample time for this unloading, if a wretched question
of trade agreements hadn't suddenly come up.</p>

<p id="id02711">"Are you clear on the chain of events?"  Captain Nemo asked me.</p>

<p id="id02712">"Perfectly clear," I said, not yet knowing why I was being given
this history lesson.</p>

<p id="id02713">"Then I'll continue.  Here's what came to pass.  The tradesmen
of Cadiz had negotiated a charter whereby they were to receive all
merchandise coming from the West Indies.  Now then, unloading the
ingots from those galleons at the port of Vigo would have been
a violation of their rights.  So they lodged a complaint in Madrid,
and they obtained an order from the indecisive King Philip V:
without unloading, the convoy would stay in custody at the offshore
mooring of Vigo until the enemy fleets had retreated.</p>

<p id="id02714">"Now then, just as this decision was being handed down, English vessels
arrived in the Bay of Vigo on October 22, 1702.  Despite his
inferior forces, Admiral de Chateau-Renault fought courageously.
But when he saw that the convoy's wealth was about to fall into
enemy hands, he burned and scuttled the galleons, which went
to the bottom with their immense treasures."</p>

<p id="id02715">Captain Nemo stopped.  I admit it:  I still couldn't see how this
piece of history concerned me.</p>

<p id="id02716">"Well?"  I asked him.</p>

<p id="id02717">"Well, Professor Aronnax," Captain Nemo answered me, "we're actually
in that Bay of Vigo, and all that's left is for you to probe
the mysteries of the place."</p>

<p id="id02718">The captain stood up and invited me to follow him.  I'd had time
to collect myself.  I did so.  The lounge was dark, but the sea's
waves sparkled through the transparent windows.  I stared.</p>

<p id="id02719">Around the Nautilus for a half-mile radius, the waters seemed saturated
with electric light.  The sandy bottom was clear and bright.
Dressed in diving suits, crewmen were busy clearing away half-rotted
barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships.
Out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver,
cascades of jewels, pieces of eight.  The sand was heaped with them.
Then, laden with these valuable spoils, the men returned to the Nautilus,
dropped off their burdens inside, and went to resume this inexhaustible
fishing for silver and gold.</p>

<p id="id02720">I understood.  This was the setting of that battle on October
22, 1702.  Here, in this very place, those galleons carrying
treasure to the Spanish government had gone to the bottom.
Here, whenever he needed, Captain Nemo came to withdraw these
millions to ballast his Nautilus.  It was for him, for him alone,
that America had yielded up its precious metals.  He was the direct,
sole heir to these treasures wrested from the Incas and those peoples
conquered by Hernando Cortez!</p>

<p id="id02721">"Did you know, professor," he asked me with a smile, "that the sea
contained such wealth?"</p>

<p id="id02722">"I know it's estimated," I replied, "that there are 2,000,000 metric
tons of silver held in suspension in seawater."</p>

<p id="id02723">"Surely, but in extracting that silver, your expenses would
outweigh your profits.  Here, by contrast, I have only to pick up
what other men have lost, and not only in this Bay of Vigo but at
a thousand other sites where ships have gone down, whose positions
are marked on my underwater chart.  Do you understand now that I'm
rich to the tune of billions?"</p>

<p id="id02724">"I understand, captain.  Nevertheless, allow me to inform you
that by harvesting this very Bay of Vigo, you're simply forestalling
the efforts of a rival organization."</p>

<p id="id02725">"What organization?"</p>

<p id="id02726">"A company chartered by the Spanish government to search for these
sunken galleons.  The company's investors were lured by the bait
of enormous gains, because this scuttled treasure is estimated
to be worth 500,000,000 francs."</p>

<p id="id02727">"It was 500,000,000 francs," Captain Nemo replied, "but no more!"</p>

<p id="id02728">"Right," I said.  "Hence a timely warning to those investors would
be an act of charity.  Yet who knows if it would be well received?
Usually what gamblers regret the most isn't the loss of their money
so much as the loss of their insane hopes.  But ultimately I feel
less sorry for them than for the thousands of unfortunate people
who would have benefited from a fair distribution of this wealth,
whereas now it will be of no help to them!"</p>

<p id="id02729">No sooner had I voiced this regret than I felt it must have
wounded Captain Nemo.</p>

<p id="id02730">"No help!" he replied with growing animation.  "Sir, what makes you
assume this wealth goes to waste when I'm the one amassing it?
Do you think I toil to gather this treasure out of selfishness?
Who says I don't put it to good use?  Do you think I'm unaware
of the suffering beings and oppressed races living on this earth,
poor people to comfort, victims to avenge?  Don't you understand . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id02731">Captain Nemo stopped on these last words, perhaps sorry that he had said
too much.  But I had guessed.  Whatever motives had driven him to seek
independence under the seas, he remained a human being before all else!
His heart still throbbed for suffering humanity, and his immense
philanthropy went out both to downtrodden races and to individuals!</p>

<p id="id02732">And now I knew where Captain Nemo had delivered those millions,
when the Nautilus navigated the waters where Crete was in rebellion
against the Ottoman Empire!</p>

<h2 id="id02733">CHAPTER 9</h2>

<h6 id="id02734">A Lost Continent</h6>

<p id="id02735">THE NEXT MORNING, February 19, I beheld the Canadian entering
my stateroom.  I was expecting this visit.  He wore an expression
of great disappointment.</p>

<p id="id02736">"Well, sir?" he said to me.</p>

<p id="id02737">"Well, Ned, the fates were against us yesterday."</p>

<p id="id02738">"Yes!  That damned captain had to call a halt just as we were going
to escape from his boat."</p>

<p id="id02739">"Yes, Ned, he had business with his bankers."</p>

<p id="id02740">"His bankers?"</p>

<p id="id02741">"Or rather his bank vaults.  By which I mean this ocean, where his
wealth is safer than in any national treasury."</p>

<p id="id02742">I then related the evening's incidents to the Canadian, secretly hoping
he would come around to the idea of not deserting the captain;
but my narrative had no result other than Ned's voicing deep regret
that he hadn't strolled across the Vigo battlefield on his own behalf.</p>

<p id="id02743">"Anyhow," he said, "it's not over yet!  My first harpoon missed,
that's all!  We'll succeed the next time, and as soon as this evening,
if need be . . ."</p>

<p id="id02744">"What's the Nautilus's heading?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id02745">"I've no idea," Ned replied.</p>

<p id="id02746">"All right, at noon we'll find out what our position is!"</p>

<p id="id02747">The Canadian returned to Conseil's side.  As soon as I was dressed,<br/>

I went into the lounge.  The compass wasn't encouraging.<br/>

The Nautilus's course was south-southwest. We were turning our<br/>

backs on Europe.<br/></p>

<p id="id02748">I could hardly wait until our position was reported on the chart.<br/>

Near 11:30 the ballast tanks emptied, and the submersible rose<br/>

to the surface of the ocean.  I leaped onto the platform.<br/>

Ned Land was already there.<br/></p>

<p id="id02749">No more shore in sight.  Nothing but the immenseness of the sea.
A few sails were on the horizon, no doubt ships going as far
as Cape S&#227;o Roque to find favorable winds for doubling the Cape
of Good Hope.  The sky was overcast.  A squall was on the way.</p>

<p id="id02750">Furious, Ned tried to see through the mists on the horizon.
He still hoped that behind all that fog there lay those shores
he longed for.</p>

<p id="id02751">At noon the sun made a momentary appearance.  Taking advantage of this
rift in the clouds, the chief officer took the orb's altitude.
Then the sea grew turbulent, we went below again, and the hatch
closed once more.</p>

<p id="id02752">When I consulted the chart an hour later, I saw that the Nautilus's
position was marked at longitude 16 degrees 17' and latitude
33 degrees 22', a good 150 leagues from the nearest coast.
It wouldn't do to even dream of escaping, and I'll let the reader
decide how promptly the Canadian threw a tantrum when I ventured
to tell him our situation.</p>

<p id="id02753">As for me, I wasn't exactly grief-stricken. I felt as if a heavy
weight had been lifted from me, and I was able to resume my regular
tasks in a state of comparative calm.</p>

<p id="id02754">Near eleven o'clock in the evening, I received a most unexpected
visit from Captain Nemo.  He asked me very graciously if I felt
exhausted from our vigil the night before.  I said no.</p>

<p id="id02755">"Then, Professor Aronnax, I propose an unusual excursion."</p>

<p id="id02756">"Propose away, captain."</p>

<p id="id02757">"So far you've visited the ocean depths only by day and under sunlight.<br/>

Would you like to see these depths on a dark night?"<br/></p>

<p id="id02758">"Very much."</p>

<p id="id02759">"I warn you, this will be an exhausting stroll.  We'll need to walk
long hours and scale a mountain.  The roads aren't terribly
well kept up."</p>

<p id="id02760">"Everything you say, captain, just increases my curiosity.<br/>

I'm ready to go with you."<br/></p>

<p id="id02761">"Then come along, professor, and we'll go put on our diving suits."</p>

<p id="id02762">Arriving at the wardrobe, I saw that neither my companions
nor any crewmen would be coming with us on this excursion.
Captain Nemo hadn't even suggested my fetching Ned or Conseil.</p>

<p id="id02763">In a few moments we had put on our equipment.  Air tanks,
abundantly charged, were placed on our backs, but the electric lamps
were not in readiness.  I commented on this to the captain.</p>

<p id="id02764">"They'll be useless to us," he replied.</p>

<p id="id02765">I thought I hadn't heard him right, but I couldn't repeat
my comment because the captain's head had already disappeared
into its metal covering.  I finished harnessing myself, I felt
an alpenstock being placed in my hand, and a few minutes later,
after the usual procedures, we set foot on the floor of the Atlantic,
300 meters down.</p>

<p id="id02766">Midnight was approaching.  The waters were profoundly dark,
but Captain Nemo pointed to a reddish spot in the distance, a sort
of wide glow shimmering about two miles from the Nautilus.  What this
fire was, what substances fed it, how and why it kept burning
in the liquid mass, I couldn't say.  Anyhow it lit our way,
although hazily, but I soon grew accustomed to this unique gloom,
and in these circumstances I understood the uselessness of
the Ruhmkorff device.</p>

<p id="id02767">Side by side, Captain Nemo and I walked directly toward this
conspicuous flame.  The level seafloor rose imperceptibly.
We took long strides, helped by our alpenstocks; but in general
our progress was slow, because our feet kept sinking into a kind
of slimy mud mixed with seaweed and assorted flat stones.</p>

<p id="id02768">As we moved forward, I heard a kind of pitter-patter above my head.
Sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous crackle.
I soon realized the cause.  It was a heavy rainfall rattling
on the surface of the waves.  Instinctively I worried that I
might get soaked!  By water in the midst of water!  I couldn't
help smiling at this outlandish notion.  But to tell the truth,
wearing these heavy diving suits, you no longer feel the liquid element,
you simply think you're in the midst of air a little denser than air
on land, that's all.</p>

<p id="id02769">After half an hour of walking, the seafloor grew rocky.
Jellyfish, microscopic crustaceans, and sea-pen coral lit it faintly
with their phosphorescent glimmers.  I glimpsed piles of stones
covered by a couple million zoophytes and tangles of algae.
My feet often slipped on this viscous seaweed carpet,
and without my alpenstock I would have fallen more than once.
When I turned around, I could still see the Nautilus's whitish beacon,
which was starting to grow pale in the distance.</p>

<p id="id02770">Those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor
with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry.  I spotted gigantic furrows
trailing off into the distant darkness, their length incalculable.
There also were other peculiarities I couldn't make sense of.
It seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter
of bones that made a dry crackling noise.  So what were these vast
plains we were now crossing?  I wanted to ask the captain, but I still
didn't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his
companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions.</p>

<p id="id02771">Meanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed
the horizon.  The presence of this furnace under the waters had me
extremely puzzled.  Was it some sort of electrical discharge?
Was I approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown
to scientists on shore?  Or, rather (and this thought did
cross my mind), had the hand of man intervened in that blaze?
Had human beings fanned those flames?  In these deep strata would
I meet up with more of Captain Nemo's companions, friends he was
about to visit who led lives as strange as his own?  Would I find
a whole colony of exiles down here, men tired of the world's woes,
men who had sought and found independence in the ocean's lower depths?
All these insane, inadmissible ideas dogged me, and in this frame
of mind, continually excited by the series of wonders passing
before my eyes, I wouldn't have been surprised to find on this sea
bottom one of those underwater towns Captain Nemo dreamed about!</p>

<p id="id02772">Our path was getting brighter and brighter.  The red glow had turned
white and was radiating from a mountain peak about 800 feet high.
But what I saw was simply a reflection produced by the crystal
waters of these strata.  The furnace that was the source of this
inexplicable light occupied the far side of the mountain.</p>

<p id="id02773">In the midst of the stone mazes furrowing this Atlantic seafloor,
Captain Nemo moved forward without hesitation.  He knew this dark path.
No doubt he had often traveled it and was incapable of losing his way.
I followed him with unshakeable confidence.  He seemed like some
Spirit of the Sea, and as he walked ahead of me, I marveled at his
tall figure, which stood out in black against the glowing background
of the horizon.</p>

<p id="id02774">It was one o'clock in the morning.  We arrived at the mountain's
lower gradients.  But in grappling with them, we had to venture up
difficult trails through a huge thicket.</p>

<p id="id02775">Yes, a thicket of dead trees!  Trees without leaves, without sap,
turned to stone by the action of the waters, and crowned here
and there by gigantic pines.  It was like a still-erect coalfield,
its roots clutching broken soil, its boughs clearly outlined
against the ceiling of the waters like thin, black, paper cutouts.
Picture a forest clinging to the sides of a peak in the Harz Mountains,
but a submerged forest.  The trails were cluttered with algae
and fucus plants, hosts of crustaceans swarming among them.
I plunged on, scaling rocks, straddling fallen tree trunks,
snapping marine creepers that swayed from one tree to another,
startling the fish that flitted from branch to branch.
Carried away, I didn't feel exhausted any more.  I followed a guide
who was immune to exhaustion.</p>

<p id="id02776">What a sight!  How can I describe it!  How can I portray these
woods and rocks in this liquid setting, their lower parts dark
and sullen, their upper parts tinted red in this light whose
intensity was doubled by the reflecting power of the waters!
We scaled rocks that crumbled behind us, collapsing in enormous
sections with the hollow rumble of an avalanche.  To our right and left
there were carved gloomy galleries where the eye lost its way.
Huge glades opened up, seemingly cleared by the hand of man,
and I sometimes wondered whether some residents of these underwater
regions would suddenly appear before me.</p>

<p id="id02777">But Captain Nemo kept climbing.  I didn't want to fall behind.
I followed him boldly.  My alpenstock was a great help.
One wrong step would have been disastrous on the narrow paths cut
into the sides of these chasms, but I walked along with a firm
tread and without the slightest feeling of dizziness.  Sometimes I
leaped over a crevasse whose depth would have made me recoil had I
been in the midst of glaciers on shore; sometimes I ventured out on
a wobbling tree trunk fallen across a gorge, without looking down,
having eyes only for marveling at the wild scenery of this region.
There, leaning on erratically cut foundations, monumental rocks
seemed to defy the laws of balance.  From between their stony knees,
trees sprang up like jets under fearsome pressure, supporting other
trees that supported them in turn.  Next, natural towers with wide,
steeply carved battlements leaned at angles that, on dry land,
the laws of gravity would never have authorized.</p>

<p id="id02778">And I too could feel the difference created by the water's
powerful density&#8212;despite my heavy clothing, copper headpiece,
and metal soles, I climbed the most impossibly steep gradients with all
the nimbleness, I swear it, of a chamois or a Pyrenees mountain goat!</p>

<p id="id02779">As for my account of this excursion under the waters, I'm well aware
that it sounds incredible!  I'm the chronicler of deeds seemingly
impossible and yet incontestably real.  This was no fantasy.
This was what I saw and felt!</p>

<p id="id02780">Two hours after leaving the Nautilus, we had cleared the timberline,
and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak, forming a dark
silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope.
Petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags.  Fish rose
in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass.  The rocky mass
was gouged with impenetrable crevices, deep caves, unfathomable holes
at whose far ends I could hear fearsome things moving around.
My blood would curdle as I watched some enormous antenna bar my path,
or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity!
A thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom.
They were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs,
giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws
with a scrap-iron clanking, titanic crabs aiming their bodies
like cannons on their carriages, and hideous devilfish intertwining
their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes.</p>

<p id="id02781">What was this astounding world that I didn't yet know?
In what order did these articulates belong, these creatures
for which the rocks provided a second carapace?  Where had nature
learned the secret of their vegetating existence, and for how many
centuries had they lived in the ocean's lower strata?</p>

<p id="id02782">But I couldn't linger.  Captain Nemo, on familiar terms with
these dreadful animals, no longer minded them.  We arrived at a
preliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me.
There picturesque ruins took shape, betraying the hand of man,
not our Creator.  They were huge stacks of stones in which you
could distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples,
now arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes, and over it all,
not ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants.</p>

<p id="id02783">But what part of the globe could this be, this land swallowed
by cataclysms?  Who had set up these rocks and stones like the dolmens
of prehistoric times?  Where was I, where had Captain Nemo's
fancies taken me?</p>

<p id="id02784">I wanted to ask him.  Unable to, I stopped him.  I seized his arm.
But he shook his head, pointed to the mountain's topmost peak,
and seemed to tell me:</p>

<p id="id02785">"Come on!  Come with me!  Come higher!"</p>

<p id="id02786">I followed him with one last burst of energy, and in a few
minutes I had scaled the peak, which crowned the whole rocky mass
by some ten meters.</p>

<p id="id02787">I looked back down the side we had just cleared.  There the mountain rose
only 700 to 800 feet above the plains; but on its far slope it crowned
the receding bottom of this part of the Atlantic by a height twice that.
My eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit by intense
flashes of light.  In essence, this mountain was a volcano.
Fifty feet below its peak, amid a shower of stones and slag,
a wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in
fiery cascades into the heart of the liquid mass.  So situated,
this volcano was an immense torch that lit up the lower plains
all the way to the horizon.</p>

<p id="id02788">As I said, this underwater crater spewed lava, but not flames.
Flames need oxygen from the air and are unable to spread underwater;
but a lava flow, which contains in itself the principle of its
incandescence, can rise to a white heat, overpower the liquid element,
and turn it into steam on contact.  Swift currents swept away all this
diffuse gas, and torrents of lava slid to the foot of the mountain,
like the disgorgings of a Mt.  Vesuvius over the city limits
of a second Torre del Greco.</p>

<p id="id02789">In fact, there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins, demolished,
overwhelmed, laid low, its roofs caved in, its temples pulled down,
its arches dislocated, its columns stretching over the earth;
in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions
of a sort of Tuscan architecture; farther off, the remains of a
gigantic aqueduct; here, the caked heights of an acropolis along
with the fluid forms of a Parthenon; there, the remnants of a wharf,
as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels
and triple-tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean;
still farther off, long rows of collapsing walls, deserted thoroughfares,
a whole Pompeii buried under the waters, which Captain Nemo had
resurrected before my eyes!</p>

<p id="id02790">Where was I?  Where was I?  I had to find out at all cost, I wanted
to speak, I wanted to rip off the copper sphere imprisoning my head.</p>

<p id="id02791">But Captain Nemo came over and stopped me with a gesture.
Then, picking up a piece of chalky stone, he advanced to a black
basaltic rock and scrawled this one word:</p>

<h5 id="id02792">ATLANTIS</h5>

<p id="id02793">What lightning flashed through my mind!  Atlantis, that ancient land
of Meropis mentioned by the historian Theopompus; Plato's Atlantis;
the continent whose very existence has been denied by such philosophers
and scientists as Origen, Porphyry, Iamblichus, d'Anville, Malte-Brun,
and Humboldt, who entered its disappearance in the ledger of myths
and folk tales; the country whose reality has nevertheless been accepted
by such other thinkers as Posidonius, Pliny, Ammianus Marcellinus,
Tertullian, Engel, Scherer, Tournefort, Buffon, and d'Avezac; I had
this land right under my eyes, furnishing its own unimpeachable
evidence of the catastrophe that had overtaken it!  So this was
the submerged region that had existed outside Europe, Asia, and Libya,
beyond the Pillars of Hercules, home of those powerful Atlantean
people against whom ancient Greece had waged its earliest wars!</p>

<p id="id02794">The writer whose narratives record the lofty deeds of those heroic
times is Plato himself.  His dialogues Timaeus and Critias were
drafted with the poet and legislator Solon as their inspiration,
as it were.</p>

<p id="id02795">One day Solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the Egyptian
capital of Sais, a town already 8,000 years of age, as documented
by the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its temples.  One of these
elders related the history of another town 1,000 years older still.
This original city of Athens, ninety centuries old, had been invaded
and partly destroyed by the Atlanteans.  These Atlanteans, he said,
resided on an immense continent greater than Africa and</p>

<p id="id02796">Asia combined, taking in an area that lay between latitude 12 degrees
and 40 degrees north.  Their dominion extended even to Egypt.  They tried
to enforce their rule as far as Greece, but they had to retreat before
the indomitable resistance of the Hellenic people.  Centuries passed.
A cataclysm occurred&#8212;floods, earthquakes.  A single night and day
were enough to obliterate this Atlantis, whose highest peaks
(Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries, the Cape Verde Islands)
still emerge above the waves.</p>

<p id="id02797">These were the historical memories that Captain Nemo's scrawl sent
rushing through my mind.  Thus, led by the strangest of fates,
I was treading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent!
My hands were touching ruins many thousands of years old,
contemporary with prehistoric times!  I was walking in the very place
where contemporaries of early man had walked!  My heavy soles
were crushing the skeletons of animals from the age of fable,
animals that used to take cover in the shade of these trees now
turned to stone!</p>

<p id="id02798">Oh, why was I so short of time!  I would have gone down the steep
slopes of this mountain, crossed this entire immense continent,
which surely connects Africa with America, and visited its great
prehistoric cities.  Under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike
town of Makhimos or the pious village of Eusebes, whose gigantic
inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise
blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters.
One day perhaps, some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken
ruins back to the surface of the waves!  Numerous underwater volcanoes
have been sighted in this part of the ocean, and many ships have
felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths.
A few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of
the elements far below, others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled
above the waves.  As far as the equator this whole seafloor is still
under construction by plutonic forces.  And in some remote epoch,
built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava,
who knows whether the peaks of these fire-belching mountains may
reappear above the surface of the Atlantic!</p>

<p id="id02799">As I mused in this way, trying to establish in my memory every
detail of this impressive landscape, Captain Nemo was leaning
his elbows on a moss-covered monument, motionless as if petrified
in some mute trance.  Was he dreaming of those lost generations,
asking them for the secret of human destiny?  Was it here that this
strange man came to revive himself, basking in historical memories,
reliving that bygone life, he who had no desire for our modern one?
I would have given anything to know his thoughts, to share them,
understand them!</p>

<p id="id02800">We stayed in this place an entire hour, contemplating its vast plains
in the lava's glow, which sometimes took on a startling intensity.
Inner boilings sent quick shivers running through the mountain's crust.
Noises from deep underneath, clearly transmitted by the liquid medium,
reverberated with majestic amplitude.</p>

<p id="id02801">Just then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass,
casting a few pale rays over this submerged continent.
It was only a fleeting glimmer, but its effect was indescribable.
The captain stood up and took one last look at these immense plains;
then his hand signaled me to follow him.</p>

<p id="id02802">We went swiftly down the mountain.  Once past the petrified forest,
I could see the Nautilus's beacon twinkling like a star.
The captain walked straight toward it, and we were back on board
just as the first glimmers of dawn were whitening the surface
of the ocean.</p>
