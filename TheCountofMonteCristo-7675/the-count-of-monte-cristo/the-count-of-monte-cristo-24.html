<p id="id06515">"Let us imagine seven such months," continued Monte Cristo, in the same
tone. "Tell me, have you ever thought that seven times 1,700,000 francs
make nearly twelve millions? No, you have not;&#8212;well, you are right,
for if you indulged in such reflections, you would never risk your
principal, which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized
man. We have our clothes, some more splendid than others,&#8212;this is our
credit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way, on
retiring from business, you have nothing but your real principal of
about five or six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are
never more than a fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive
on a railway, the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam
surrounding it. Well, out of the five or six millions which form your
real capital, you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of
course, in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune;
to follow out my simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and this
if repeated three or four times will cause death&#8212;so pay attention to
it, my dear Monsieur Danglars. Do you want money? Do you wish me to lend
you some?"</p>

<p id="id06516">"What a bad calculator you are!" exclaimed Danglars, calling to his
assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation. "I have made money at
the same time by speculations which have succeeded. I have made up
the loss of blood by nutrition. I lost a battle in Spain, I have been
defeated in Trieste, but my naval army in India will have taken some
galleons, and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine."</p>

<p id="id06517">"Very good, very good! But the wound remains and will reopen at the
first loss."</p>

<p id="id06518">"No, for I am only embarked in certainties," replied Danglars, with
the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises; "to involve me, three
governments must crumble to dust."</p>

<p id="id06519">"Well, such things have been."</p>

<p id="id06520">"That there should be a famine!"</p>

<p id="id06521">"Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine."</p>

<p id="id06522">"Or, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of Pharaoh, and even
then my vessels would become caravans."</p>

<p id="id06523">"So much the better. I congratulate you, my dear M. Danglars," said
Monte Cristo; "I see I was deceived, and that you belong to the class of
second-rate fortunes."</p>

<p id="id06524">"I think I may aspire to that honor," said Danglars with a smile, which
reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond
of daubing into their pictures of ruins. "But, while we are speaking of
business," Danglars added, pleased to find an opportunity of changing
the subject, "tell me what I am to do for M. Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id06525">"Give him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation
seems good."</p>

<p id="id06526">"Excellent; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000
francs, payable at sight, on you, signed by Busoni, and returned by you
to me, with your indorsement&#8212;of course, I immediately counted him over
the forty bank-notes."</p>

<p id="id06527">Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent. "But that is not all,"
continued Danglars; "he has opened an account with my house for his
son."</p>

<p id="id06528">"May I ask how much he allows the young man?"</p>

<p id="id06529">"Five thousand francs per month."</p>

<p id="id06530">"Sixty thousand francs per year. I thought I was right in believing that
Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow. How can a young man live upon 5,000
francs a month?"</p>

<p id="id06531">"But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands
more"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06532">"Do not advance it; the father will never repay it. You do not know
these ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers. And by whom
were they recommended to you?"</p>

<p id="id06533">"Oh, by the house of Fenzi, one of the best in Florence."</p>

<p id="id06534">"I do not mean to say you will lose, but, nevertheless, mind you hold to
the terms of the agreement."</p>

<p id="id06535">"Would you not trust the Cavalcanti?"</p>

<p id="id06536">"I? oh, I would advance six millions on his signature. I was only
speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning
just now."</p>

<p id="id06537">"And with all this, how unassuming he is! I should never have taken him
for anything more than a mere major."</p>

<p id="id06538">"And you would have flattered him, for certainly, as you say, he has
no manner. The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old
lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets. But all the Italians
are the same; they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in
Oriental splendor."</p>

<p id="id06539">"The young man is better," said Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06540">"Yes; a little nervous, perhaps, but, upon the whole, he appeared
tolerable. I was uneasy about him."</p>

<p id="id06541">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id06542">"Because you met him at my house, just after his introduction into the
world, as they told me. He has been travelling with a very severe tutor,
and had never been to Paris before."</p>

<p id="id06543">"Ah, I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?" asked<br/>

Danglars carelessly; "they like to unite their fortunes."<br/></p>

<p id="id06544">"It is usual, certainly; but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing
like other people. I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to
France to choose a wife."</p>

<p id="id06545">"Do you think so?"</p>

<p id="id06546">"I am sure of it."</p>

<p id="id06547">"And you have heard his fortune mentioned?"</p>

<p id="id06548">"Nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions, and
others that he did not possess a farthing."</p>

<p id="id06549">"And what is your opinion?"</p>

<p id="id06550">"I ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal
impression."</p>

<p id="id06551">"Well, and it is that"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06552">"My opinion is, that all these old podestas, these ancient
condottieri,&#8212;for the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed
provinces,&#8212;my opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions
in corners, the secret of which they have transmitted only to their
eldest sons, who have done the same from generation to generation; and
the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the
florins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have
become reflected in them."</p>

<p id="id06553">"Certainly," said Danglars, "and this is further supported by the fact
of their not possessing an inch of land."</p>

<p id="id06554">"Very little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses,
excepting his palace in Lucca."</p>

<p id="id06555">"Ah, he has a palace?" said Danglars, laughing; "come, that is
something."</p>

<p id="id06556">"Yes; and more than that, he lets it to the Minister of Finance while
he lives in a simple house. Oh, as I told you before, I think the old
fellow is very close."</p>

<p id="id06557">"Come, you do not flatter him."</p>

<p id="id06558">"I scarcely know him; I think I have seen him three times in my life;
all I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself. He was telling
me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant in
Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in
France or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that
though I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for
this."</p>

<p id="id06559">"Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is a
fine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of
it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is
merely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do
they give them any fortune?"</p>

<p id="id06560">"Oh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich as
a gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons
married according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they married
against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month. Should
Andrea marry according to his father's views, he will, perhaps, give him
one, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were the daughter
of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the father-in-law
of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the major takes the
key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would be obliged to live
like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling cards or rattling the
dice."</p>

<p id="id06561">"Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will
want a crown and an immense fortune."</p>

<p id="id06562">"No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry
into plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But do
you wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so
many questions?"</p>

<p id="id06563">"Ma foi," said Danglars, "it would not be a bad speculation, I fancy,
and you know I am a speculator."</p>

<p id="id06564">"You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not
like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?"</p>

<p id="id06565">"Albert," repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; "ah, well; he
would care very little about it, I think."</p>

<p id="id06566">"But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?"</p>

<p id="id06567">"Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame
de Morcerf and Albert"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06568">"You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?"</p>

<p id="id06569">"Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de<br/>

Morcerf."<br/></p>

<p id="id06570">"Mademoiselle Danglars' fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if
the telegraph should not make any more mistakes."</p>

<p id="id06571">"Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06572">"What?"</p>

<p id="id06573">"Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?"</p>

<p id="id06574">"I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being
obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air."</p>

<p id="id06575">"Yes, yes," said Danglars, laughing, "it would do her a great deal of
good."</p>

<p id="id06576">"Why so?"</p>

<p id="id06577">"Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth." Monte Cristo
took no notice of this ill-natured remark.</p>

<p id="id06578">"But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars," said the
count, "you must allow that he has a fine name?"</p>

<p id="id06579">"So he has; but I like mine as well."</p>

<p id="id06580">"Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have
adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according
to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which
dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon
twenty years."</p>

<p id="id06581">"And for this very reason," said Danglars with a smile, which he
tried to make sardonic, "I prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M. Albert de
Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id06582">"Still, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti?"</p>

<p id="id06583">"The Morcerfs!&#8212;Stay, my dear count," said Danglars; "you are a man of
the world, are you not?"</p>

<p id="id06584">"I think so."</p>

<p id="id06585">"And you understand heraldry?"</p>

<p id="id06586">"A little."</p>

<p id="id06587">"Well, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerf's."</p>

<p id="id06588">"Why so?"</p>

<p id="id06589">"Because, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at least,<br/>

Danglars."<br/></p>

<p id="id06590">"Well, what then?"</p>

<p id="id06591">"While his name is not Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id06592">"How?&#8212;not Morcerf?"</p>

<p id="id06593">"Not the least in the world."</p>

<p id="id06594">"Go on."</p>

<p id="id06595">"I have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made himself a
count, so that he is not one at all."</p>

<p id="id06596">"Impossible!"</p>

<p id="id06597">"Listen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather my
acquaintance, during the last thirty years. You know I have made the
most of my arms, though I never forgot my origin."</p>

<p id="id06598">"A proof of great humility or great pride," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id06599">"Well, when I was a clerk, Morcerf was a mere fisherman."</p>

<p id="id06600">"And then he was called"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06601">"Fernand."</p>

<p id="id06602">"Only Fernand?"</p>

<p id="id06603">"Fernand Mondego."</p>

<p id="id06604">"You are sure?"</p>

<p id="id06605">"Pardieu, I have bought enough fish of him to know his name."</p>

<p id="id06606">"Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?"</p>

<p id="id06607">"Because Fernand and Danglars, being both parvenus, both having become
noble, both rich, are about equal in worth, excepting that there have
been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me."</p>

<p id="id06608">"What?"</p>

<p id="id06609">"Oh, nothing!"</p>

<p id="id06610">"Ah, yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of<br/>

Fernand Mondego. I have heard that name in Greece."<br/></p>

<p id="id06611">"In conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha?"</p>

<p id="id06612">"Exactly so."</p>

<p id="id06613">"This is the mystery," said Danglars. "I acknowledge I would have given
anything to find it out."</p>

<p id="id06614">"It would be very easy if you much wished it?"</p>

<p id="id06615">"How so?"</p>

<p id="id06616">"Probably you have some correspondent in Greece?"</p>

<p id="id06617">"I should think so."</p>

<p id="id06618">"At Yanina?"</p>

<p id="id06619">"Everywhere."</p>

<p id="id06620">"Well, write to your correspondent in Yanina, and ask him what part was
played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali
Tepelini."</p>

<p id="id06621">"You are right," exclaimed Danglars, rising quickly, "I will write
to-day."</p>

<p id="id06622">"Do so."</p>

<p id="id06623">"I will."</p>

<p id="id06624">"And if you should hear of anything very scandalous"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06625">"I will communicate it to you."</p>

<p id="id06626">"You will oblige me." Danglars rushed out of the room, and made but one
leap into his coupe.</p>

<h2 id="id06627" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 67. At the Office of the King's Attorney.</h2>

<p id="id06628">Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and
follow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion. We have said that at
half-past twelve o'clock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses, and had
left home in the carriage. She directed her course towards the Faubourg
Saint Germain, went down the Rue Mazarine, and stopped at the Passage
du Pont-Neuf. She descended, and went through the passage. She was very
plainly dressed, as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in
the morning. At the Rue Guenegaud she called a cab, and directed the
driver to go to the Rue de Harlay. As soon as she was seated in the
vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil, which she
tied on to her straw bonnet. She then replaced the bonnet, and saw
with pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her white complexion and
brilliant eyes were alone visible. The cab crossed the Pont-Neuf and
entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine; the driver was paid as
the door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon
reached the Salle des Pas-Perdus.</p>

<p id="id06629">There was a great deal going on that morning, and many business-like
persons at the Palais; business-like persons pay very little attention
to women, and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any
more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer. There was
a great press of people in M. de Villefort's ante-chamber, but Madame
Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name. The instant she
appeared the door-keeper rose, came to her, and asked her whether she
was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment; and
on her affirmative answer being given, he conducted her by a private
passage to M. de Villefort's office. The magistrate was seated in an
arm-chair, writing, with his back towards the door; he did not move as
he heard it open, and the door-keeper pronounce the words, "Walk in,
madame," and then reclose it; but no sooner had the man's footsteps
ceased, than he started up, drew the bolts, closed the curtains, and
examined every corner of the room. Then, when he had assured himself
that he could neither be seen nor heard, and was consequently relieved
of doubts, he said,&#8212;"Thanks, madame,&#8212;thanks for your punctuality;" and
he offered a chair to Madame Danglars, which she accepted, for her heart
beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated.</p>

<p id="id06630">"It is a long time, madame," said the procureur, describing a
half-circle with his chair, so as to place himself exactly opposite
to Madame Danglars,&#8212;"it is a long time since I had the pleasure of
speaking alone with you, and I regret that we have only now met to enter
upon a painful conversation."</p>

<p id="id06631">"Nevertheless, sir, you see I have answered your first appeal, although
certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for
you." Villefort smiled bitterly.</p>

<p id="id06632">"It is true, then," he said, rather uttering his thoughts aloud than
addressing his companion,&#8212;"it is true, then, that all our actions leave
their traces&#8212;some sad, others bright&#8212;on our paths; it is true
that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the
sands;&#8212;it leaves its track! Alas, to many the path is traced by tears."</p>

<p id="id06633">"Sir," said Madame Danglars, "you can feel for my emotion, can you not?
Spare me, then, I beseech you. When I look at this room,&#8212;whence so many
guilty creatures have departed, trembling and ashamed, when I look
at that chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamed,&#8212;oh, it
requires all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman
and you a menacing judge." Villefort dropped his head and sighed. "And
I," he said, "I feel that my place is not in the judge's seat, but on
the prisoner's stool."</p>

<p id="id06634">"You?" said Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06635">"Yes, I."</p>

<p id="id06636">"I think, sir, you exaggerate your situation," said Madame Danglars,
whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment. "The paths of which you were
just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations.
Besides the pleasure, there is always remorse from the indulgence of our
passions, and, after all, what have you men to fear from all this? the
world excuses, and notoriety ennobles you."</p>

<p id="id06637">"Madame," replied Villefort, "you know that I am no hypocrite, or, at
least, that I never deceive without a reason. If my brow be severe, it
is because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be petrified,
it is that it might sustain the blows it has received. I was not so in
my youth, I was not so on the night of the betrothal, when we were all
seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles. But since
then everything has changed in and about me; I am accustomed to brave
difficulties, and, in the conflict to crush those who, by their own free
will, or by chance, voluntarily or involuntarily, interfere with me in
my career. It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire
is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it, or from
whom we attempt to snatch it. Thus, the greater number of a man's errors
come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity; then,
after error has been committed in a moment of excitement, of delirium,
or of fear, we see that we might have avoided and escaped it. The means
we might have used, which we in our blindness could not see, then seem
simple and easy, and we say, 'Why did I not do this, instead of that?'
Women, on the contrary, are rarely tormented with remorse; for the
decision does not come from you,&#8212;your misfortunes are generally imposed
upon you, and your faults the results of others' crimes."</p>

<p id="id06638">"In any case, sir, you will allow," replied Madame Danglars, "that, even
if the fault were alone mine, I last night received a severe punishment
for it."</p>

<p id="id06639">"Poor thing," said Villefort, pressing her hand, "it was too severe for
your strength, for you were twice overwhelmed, and yet"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06640">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id06641">"Well, I must tell you. Collect all your courage, for you have not yet
heard all."</p>

<p id="id06642">"Ah," exclaimed Madame Danglars, alarmed, "what is there more to hear?"</p>

<p id="id06643">"You only look back to the past, and it is, indeed, bad enough. Well,
picture to yourself a future more gloomy still&#8212;certainly frightful,
perhaps sanguinary." The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was,
and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened
her mouth to scream, but the sound died in her throat. "How has this
terrible past been recalled?" cried Villefort; "how is it that it has
escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts,
where it was buried, to visit us now, like a phantom, whitening our
cheeks and flushing our brows with shame?"</p>

<p id="id06644">"Alas," said Hermine, "doubtless it is chance."</p>

<p id="id06645">"Chance?" replied Villefort; "No, no, madame, there is no such thing as
chance."</p>

<p id="id06646">"Oh, yes; has not a fatal chance revealed all this? Was it not by chance
the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house? Was it not by chance he
caused the earth to be dug up? Is it not by chance that the unfortunate
child was disinterred under the trees?&#8212;that poor innocent offspring of
mine, which I never even kissed, but for whom I wept many, many tears.
Ah, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found
beneath the flowers."</p>

<p id="id06647">"Well, no, madame,&#8212;this is the terrible news I have to tell you," said
Villefort in a hollow voice&#8212;"no, nothing was found beneath the flowers;
there was no child disinterred&#8212;no. You must not weep, no, you must not
groan, you must tremble!"</p>

<p id="id06648">"What can you mean?" asked Madame Danglars, shuddering.</p>

<p id="id06649">"I mean that M. de Monte Cristo, digging underneath these trees, found
neither skeleton nor chest, because neither of them was there!"</p>

<p id="id06650">"Neither of them there?" repeated Madame Danglars, her staring,
wide-open eyes expressing her alarm.</p>

<p id="id06651">"Neither of them there!" she again said, as though striving to impress
herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her.</p>

<p id="id06652">"No," said Villefort, burying his face in his hands, "no, a hundred
times no!"</p>

<p id="id06653">"Then you did not bury the poor child there, sir? Why did you deceive
me? Where did you place it? tell me&#8212;where?"</p>

<p id="id06654">"There! But listen to me&#8212;listen&#8212;and you will pity me who has for
twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal,
without casting the least portion upon you."</p>

<p id="id06655">"Oh, you frighten me! But speak; I will listen."</p>

<p id="id06656">"You recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that
bed in the red damask room, while I, scarcely less agitated than you,
awaited your delivery. The child was born, was given to me&#8212;motionless,
breathless, voiceless; we thought it dead." Madame Danglars moved
rapidly, as though she would spring from her chair, but Villefort
stopped, and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention. "We
thought it dead," he repeated; "I placed it in the chest, which was to
take the place of a coffin; I descended to the garden, I dug a hole, and
then flung it down in haste. Scarcely had I covered it with earth, when
the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me; I saw a shadow rise,
and, at the same time, a flash of light. I felt pain; I wished to cry
out, but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; I fell
lifeless, and fancied myself killed. Never shall I forget your sublime
courage, when, having returned to consciousness, I dragged myself to the
foot of the stairs, and you, almost dying yourself, came to meet me. We
were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe. You had the
fortitude to regain the house, assisted by your nurse. A duel was
the pretext for my wound. Though we scarcely expected it, our secret
remained in our own keeping alone. I was taken to Versailles; for three
months I struggled with death; at last, as I seemed to cling to life,
I was ordered to the South. Four men carried me from Paris to Chalons,
walking six leagues a day; Madame de Villefort followed the litter in
her carriage. At Chalons I was put upon the Saone, thence I passed on
to the Rhone, whence I descended, merely with the current, to Arles;
at Arles I was again placed on my litter, and continued my journey to
Marseilles. My recovery lasted six months. I never heard you mentioned,
and I did not dare inquire for you. When I returned to Paris, I learned
that you, the widow of M. de Nargonne, had married M. Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06657">"What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness
returned to me? Always the same&#8212;always the child's corpse, coming every
night in my dreams, rising from the earth, and hovering over the grave
with menacing look and gesture. I inquired immediately on my return to
Paris; the house had not been inhabited since we left it, but it had
just been let for nine years. I found the tenant. I pretended that I
disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife's father and mother
should pass into the hands of strangers. I offered to pay them for
cancelling the lease; they demanded 6,000 francs. I would have given
10,000&#8212;I would have given 20,000. I had the money with me; I made the
tenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so
much wanted, I galloped to Auteuil.</p>

<p id="id06658">"No one had entered the house since I had left it. It was five o'clock
in the afternoon; I ascended into the red room, and waited for night.
There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant
agony came back with double force. The Corsican, who had declared the
vendetta against me, who had followed me from Nimes to Paris, who had
hid himself in the garden, who had struck me, had seen me dig the grave,
had seen me inter the child,&#8212;he might become acquainted with your
person,&#8212;nay, he might even then have known it. Would he not one day
make you pay for keeping this terrible secret? Would it not be a sweet
revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his
dagger? It was therefore necessary, before everything else, and at all
risks, that I should cause all traces of the past to disappear&#8212;that
I should destroy every material vestige; too much reality would always
remain in my recollection. It was for this I had annulled the lease&#8212;it
was for this I had come&#8212;it was for this I was waiting. Night arrived;
I allowed it to become quite dark. I was without a light in that room;
when the wind shook all the doors, behind which I continually expected
to see some spy concealed, I trembled. I seemed everywhere to hear your
moans behind me in the bed, and I dared not turn around. My heart beat
so violently that I feared my wound would open. At length, one by one,
all the noises in the neighborhood ceased. I understood that I had
nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen nor heard, so I decided
upon descending to the garden.</p>

<p id="id06659">"Listen, Hermine; I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I
drew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found
in my coat&#8212;that little key we both used to cherish so much, which you
wished to have fastened to a golden ring&#8212;when I opened the door, and
saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral
staircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly
shrieked. I seemed to be going mad. At last I mastered my agitation. I
descended the staircase step by step; the only thing I could not conquer
was a strange trembling in my knees. I grasped the railings; if I had
relaxed my hold for a moment, I should have fallen. I reached the lower
door. Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall; I took
it, and advanced towards the thicket. I had provided myself with a
dark lantern. In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it, then I
continued my path.</p>

<p id="id06660">"It was the end of November, all the verdure of the garden had
disappeared, the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long
bony arms, and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet. My
terror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket, that
I took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself. I fancied continually
that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches. I examined
the thicket with my dark lantern; it was empty. I looked carefully
around; I was indeed alone,&#8212;no noise disturbed the silence but the owl,
whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night.
I tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the
precise spot where I stopped to dig the hole.</p>

<p id="id06661">"The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer, and when
autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it. Still one place where
the grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had
turned up the ground. I went to work. The hour, then, for which I had
been waiting during the last year had at length arrived. How I worked,
how I hoped, how I struck every piece of turf, thinking to find some
resistance to my spade! But no, I found nothing, though I had made a
hole twice as large as the first. I thought I had been deceived&#8212;had
mistaken the spot. I turned around, I looked at the trees, I tried to
recall the details which had struck me at the time. A cold, sharp wind
whistled through the leafless branches, and yet the drops fell from my
forehead. I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling
the ground to fill up the hole; while doing so I had leaned against a
laburnum; behind me was an artificial rockery, intended to serve as a
resting-place for persons walking in the garden; in falling, my hand,
relaxing its hold of the laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone. On my
right I saw the tree, behind me the rock. I stood in the same attitude,
and threw myself down. I rose, and again began digging and enlarging the
hole; still I found nothing, nothing&#8212;the chest was no longer there!"</p>

<p id="id06662">"The chest no longer there?" murmured Madame Danglars, choking with
fear.</p>

<p id="id06663">"Think not I contented myself with this one effort," continued
Villefort. "No; I searched the whole thicket. I thought the assassin,
having discovered the chest, and supposing it to be a treasure, had
intended carrying it off, but, perceiving his error, had dug another
hole, and deposited it there; but I could find nothing. Then the idea
struck me that he had not taken these precautions, and had simply thrown
it in a corner. In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my
search. I remained in the room and waited."</p>

<p id="id06664">"Oh, heavens!"</p>

<p id="id06665">When daylight dawned I went down again. My first visit was to the
thicket. I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the
darkness. I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty
feet square, and a depth of two feet. A laborer would not have done in
a day what occupied me an hour. But I could find nothing&#8212;absolutely
nothing. Then I renewed the search. Supposing it had been thrown aside,
it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this
examination was as useless as the first, and with a bursting heart I
returned to the thicket, which now contained no hope for me."</p>

<p id="id06666">"Oh," cried Madame Danglars, "it was enough to drive you mad!"</p>

<p id="id06667">"I hoped for a moment that it might," said Villefort; "but that
happiness was denied me. However, recovering my strength and my ideas,
'Why,' said I, 'should that man have carried away the corpse?'"</p>

<p id="id06668">"But you said," replied Madame Danglars, "he would require it as a
proof."</p>

<p id="id06669">"Ah, no, madame, that could not be. Dead bodies are not kept a year;
they are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. Now, nothing
of the kind has happened."</p>

<p id="id06670">"What then?" asked Hermine, trembling violently.</p>

<p id="id06671">"Something more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us&#8212;the child
was, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!"</p>

<p id="id06672">Madame Danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing Villefort's hands,
exclaimed, "My child was alive?" said she; "you buried my child alive?
You were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? Ah"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06673">Madame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands
she wrung in her feeble grasp. "I know not; I merely suppose so, as I
might suppose anything else," replied Villefort with a look so fixed,
it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and
madness. "Ah, my child, my poor child!" cried the baroness, falling
on her chair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief. Villefort,
becoming somewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm
gathering over his head, he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror
he felt. "You understand, then, that if it were so," said he, rising in
his turn, and approaching the baroness, to speak to her in a lower tone,
"we are lost. This child lives, and some one knows it lives&#8212;some one is
in possession of our secret; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of
a child disinterred, when that child could not be found, it is he who is
in possession of our secret."</p>

<p id="id06674">"Just God, avenging God!" murmured Madame Danglars.</p>

<p id="id06675">Villefort's only answer was a stifled groan.</p>

<p id="id06676">"But the child&#8212;the child, sir?" repeated the agitated mother.</p>

<p id="id06677">"How I have searched for him," replied Villefort, wringing his hands;
"how I have called him in my long sleepless nights; how I have longed
for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men,
and to find mine among them! At last, one day, when for the hundredth
time I took up my spade, I asked myself again and again what the
Corsican could have done with the child. A child encumbers a fugitive;
perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it into the
river."</p>

<p id="id06678">"Impossible!" cried Madame Danglars: "a man may murder another out of
revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child."</p>

<p id="id06679">"Perhaps," continued Villefort, "he had put it in the foundling
hospital."</p>

<p id="id06680">"Oh, yes, yes," cried the baroness; "my child is there!"</p>

<p id="id06681">"I ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night&#8212;the night of
the 20th of September&#8212;a child had been brought there, wrapped in part
of a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half. This portion of the
napkin was marked with half a baron's crown, and the letter H."</p>

<p id="id06682">"Truly, truly," said Madame Danglars, "all my linen is marked thus;
Monsieur de Nargonne was a baronet, and my name is Hermine. Thank God,
my child was not then dead!"</p>

<p id="id06683">"No, it was not dead."</p>

<p id="id06684">"And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy? Where is
the child?" Villefort shrugged his shoulders. "Do I know?" said he; "and
do you believe that if I knew I would relate to you all its trials and
all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer? Alas, no,
I know not. A woman, about six months after, came to claim it with the
other half of the napkin. This woman gave all the requisite particulars,
and it was intrusted to her."</p>

<p id="id06685">"But you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced
her."</p>

<p id="id06686">"And what do you think I did? I feigned a criminal process, and employed
all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her. They
traced her to Chalons, and there they lost her."</p>

<p id="id06687">"They lost her?"</p>

<p id="id06688">"Yes, forever." Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a
sigh, a tear, or a shriek for every detail. "And this is all?" said she;
"and you stopped there?"</p>

<p id="id06689">"Oh, no," said Villefort; "I never ceased to search and to inquire.<br/>

However, the last two or three years I had allowed myself some respite.<br/>

But now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever, since<br/>

fear urges me, not my conscience."<br/></p>

<p id="id06690">"But," replied Madame Danglars, "the Count of Monte Cristo can know
nothing, or he would not seek our society as he does."</p>

<p id="id06691">"Oh, the wickedness of man is very great," said Villefort, "since it
surpasses the goodness of God. Did you observe that man's eyes while he
was speaking to us?"</p>

<p id="id06692">"No."</p>

<p id="id06693">"But have you ever watched him carefully?"</p>

<p id="id06694">"Doubtless he is capricious, but that is all; one thing alone struck
me,&#8212;of all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched
nothing. I might have suspected he was poisoning us."</p>

<p id="id06695">"And you see you would have been deceived."</p>

<p id="id06696">"Yes, doubtless."</p>

<p id="id06697">"But believe me, that man has other projects. For that reason I
wished to see you, to speak to you, to warn you against every one, but
especially against him. Tell me," cried Villefort, fixing his eyes more
steadfastly on her than he had ever done before, "did you ever reveal to
any one our connection?"</p>

<p id="id06698">"Never, to any one."</p>

<p id="id06699">"You understand me," replied Villefort, affectionately; "when I say any
one,&#8212;pardon my urgency,&#8212;to any one living I mean?"</p>

<p id="id06700">"Yes, yes, I understand very well," ejaculated the baroness; "never, I
swear to you."</p>

<p id="id06701">"Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had
transpired in the morning? Do you keep a journal?"</p>

<p id="id06702">"No, my life has been passed in frivolity; I wish to forget it myself."</p>

<p id="id06703">"Do you talk in your sleep?"</p>

<p id="id06704">"I sleep soundly, like a child; do you not remember?" The color mounted
to the baroness's face, and Villefort turned awfully pale.</p>

<p id="id06705">"It is true," said he, in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard.</p>

<p id="id06706">"Well?" said the baroness.</p>

<p id="id06707">"Well, I understand what I now have to do," replied Villefort. "In
less than one week from this time I will ascertain who this M. de Monte
Cristo is, whence he comes, where he goes, and why he speaks in our
presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden." Villefort
pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the
count shudder had he heard him. Then he pressed the hand the baroness
reluctantly gave him, and led her respectfully back to the door. Madame
Danglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the other side of
which she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping peacefully on
his box while waiting for her.</p>

<h2 id="id06708" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 68. A Summer Ball.</h2>

<p id="id06709">The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the
procureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed
through the gateway of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the
door was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son's
arm. Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his
toilet, drove to the Champs Elysees, to the house of Monte Cristo. The
count received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing that
no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man's favor. Those who
would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an impassable
barrier. Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he
drew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply held out his hand.
Monte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his invariable practice.
"Here I am, dear count."</p>

<p id="id06710">"Welcome home again."</p>

<p id="id06711">"I arrived an hour since."</p>

<p id="id06712">"From Dieppe?"</p>

<p id="id06713">"No, from Treport."</p>

<p id="id06714">"Indeed?"</p>

<p id="id06715">"And I have come at once to see you."</p>

<p id="id06716">"That is extremely kind of you," said Monte Cristo with a tone of
perfect indifference.</p>

<p id="id06717">"And what is the news?"</p>

<p id="id06718">"You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news."</p>

<p id="id06719">"I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for
me?"</p>

<p id="id06720">"Had you commissioned me?" said Monte Cristo, feigning uneasiness.</p>

<p id="id06721">"Come, come," said Albert, "do not assume so much indifference. It is
said, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Treport, I felt the electric
shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me."</p>

<p id="id06722">"Possibly," said Monte Cristo, "I have indeed thought of you, but the
magnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge."</p>

<p id="id06723">"Indeed? Pray tell me how it happened?"</p>

<p id="id06724">"Willingly. M. Danglars dined with me."</p>

<p id="id06725">"I know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town."</p>

<p id="id06726">"But he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id06727">"Your Italian prince?"</p>

<p id="id06728">"Not so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count."</p>

<p id="id06729">"Calls himself, do you say?"</p>

<p id="id06730">"Yes, calls himself."</p>

<p id="id06731">"Is he not a count?"</p>

<p id="id06732">"What can I know of him? He calls himself so. I, of course, give him the
same title, and every one else does likewise."</p>

<p id="id06733">"What a strange man you are! What next? You say M. Danglars dined here?"</p>

<p id="id06734">"Yes, with Count Cavalcanti, the marquis his father, Madame Danglars,<br/>

M. and Madame de Villefort,&#8212;charming people,&#8212;M. Debray, Maximilian<br/>

Morrel, and M. de Chateau-Renaud."<br/></p>

<p id="id06735">"Did they speak of me?"</p>

<p id="id06736">"Not a word."</p>

<p id="id06737">"So much the worse."</p>

<p id="id06738">"Why so? I thought you wished them to forget you?"</p>

<p id="id06739">"If they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I am
in despair."</p>

<p id="id06740">"How will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the
number here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of you at
home."</p>

<p id="id06741">"I have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way in
which I think of her."</p>

<p id="id06742">"Touching sympathy! So you hate each other?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id06743">"Listen," said Morcerf&#8212;"if Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take
pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with
all matrimonial formalities between our two families, I am ready to
agree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars would make a
charming mistress&#8212;but a wife&#8212;diable!"</p>

<p id="id06744">"And this," said Monte Cristo, "is your opinion of your intended
spouse?"</p>

<p id="id06745">"Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as this
dream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my
lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and
music within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens
me. One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,&#8212;good heavens! There she
must always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful."</p>

<p id="id06746">"You are difficult to please, viscount."</p>

<p id="id06747">"Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible."</p>

<p id="id06748">"What is that?"</p>

<p id="id06749">"To find such a wife as my father found." Monte Cristo turned pale, and
looked at Albert, while playing with some magnificent pistols.</p>

<p id="id06750">"Your father was fortunate, then?" said he.</p>

<p id="id06751">"You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,&#8212;still beautiful,
witty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have stayed with
his mother for four days at Treport, it would have been a condescension
or a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more peaceful&#8212;shall
I say more poetic!&#8212;than if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my
companion."</p>

<p id="id06752">"That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make every one vow
to live a single life."</p>

<p id="id06753">"Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars. Have
you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain
possession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at Marle's
or Fossin's shines with more splendor when it is our own; but if we
are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another, and still
must retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we have to
endure?"</p>

<p id="id06754">"Worldling," murmured the count.</p>

<p id="id06755">"Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugenie perceives I am but a
pitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has
millions." Monte Cristo smiled. "One plan occurred to me," continued
Albert; "Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to make him fall in
love with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four letters, written
in the most alluring style, he invariably answered: 'My eccentricity may
be great, but it will not make me break my promise.'"</p>

<p id="id06756">"That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one
whom you would not marry yourself." Albert smiled.&#8212;"Apropos," continued
he, "Franz is coming soon, but it will not interest you; you dislike
him, I think?"</p>

<p id="id06757">"I?" said Monte Cristo; "my dear Viscount, how have you discovered that<br/>

I did not like M. Franz! I like every one."<br/></p>

<p id="id06758">"And you include me in the expression every one&#8212;many thanks!"</p>

<p id="id06759">"Let us not mistake," said Monte Cristo; "I love every one as God
commands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I thoroughly
hate but a few. Let us return to M. Franz d'Epinay. Did you say he was
coming?"</p>

<p id="id06760">"Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get
Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle
Eugenie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of
a grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one's
pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done."</p>

<p id="id06761">"But M. d'Epinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently."</p>

<p id="id06762">"Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie,
and speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and
Madame de Villefort."</p>

<p id="id06763">"Which they deserve, do they not?"</p>

<p id="id06764">"I believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a
just man."</p>

<p id="id06765">"There is, then, one," said Monte Cristo, "whom you do not condemn like
poor Danglars?"</p>

<p id="id06766">"Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps," replied<br/>

Albert, laughing.<br/></p>

<p id="id06767">"Indeed, my dear sir," said Monte Cristo, "you are revoltingly foppish."</p>

<p id="id06768">"I foppish? how do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id06769">"Yes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to struggle
to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their course;
perhaps you may not have to retract."</p>

<p id="id06770">"Bah," said Albert, staring.</p>

<p id="id06771">"Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and
seriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?"</p>

<p id="id06772">"I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so."</p>

<p id="id06773">"Then make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that sum
to attain the same end."</p>

<p id="id06774">"Am I, indeed, so happy?" said Albert, who still could not prevent an
almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. "But, my dear count,
has M. Danglars any reason?"</p>

<p id="id06775">"Ah, there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the
self-love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is
attacked with a needle."</p>

<p id="id06776">"But yet M. Danglars appeared"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06777">"Delighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and is
still more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for
yourself."</p>

<p id="id06778">"Thank you, I understand. But my mother&#8212;no, not my mother; I
mistake&#8212;my father intends giving a ball."</p>

<p id="id06779">"A ball at this season?"</p>

<p id="id06780">"Summer balls are fashionable."</p>

<p id="id06781">"If they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would
become so."</p>

<p id="id06782">"You are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain
in Paris in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our
invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?"</p>

<p id="id06783">"When will it take place?"</p>

<p id="id06784">"On Saturday."</p>

<p id="id06785">"M. Cavalcanti's father will be gone."</p>

<p id="id06786">"But the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?"</p>

<p id="id06787">"I do not know him, viscount."</p>

<p id="id06788">"You do not know him?"</p>

<p id="id06789">"No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible for
him."</p>

<p id="id06790">"But you receive him at your house?"</p>

<p id="id06791">"That is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abbe, who may
be deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to present
him. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you would
accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,&#8212;besides, I may not
be there myself."</p>

<p id="id06792">"Where?"</p>

<p id="id06793">"At your ball."</p>

<p id="id06794">"Why should you not be there?"</p>

<p id="id06795">"Because you have not yet invited me."</p>

<p id="id06796">"But I come expressly for that purpose."</p>

<p id="id06797">"You are very kind, but I may be prevented."</p>

<p id="id06798">"If I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all
impediments."</p>

<p id="id06799">"Tell me what it is."</p>

<p id="id06800">"My mother begs you to come."</p>

<p id="id06801">"The Comtesse de Morcerf?" said Monte Cristo, starting.</p>

<p id="id06802">"Ah, count," said Albert, "I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely
to me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I
spoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely devoid of them,
for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else."</p>

<p id="id06803">"You have talked of me?"</p>

<p id="id06804">"Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!"</p>

<p id="id06805">"Then I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her too
reasonable to be led by imagination."</p>

<p id="id06806">"A problem, my dear count, for every one&#8212;for my mother as well as
others; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do not
fear. My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved. I
believe, while the Countess G&#8212;&#8212; takes you for Lord Ruthven, my mother
imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The first
opportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy for
you, as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other."</p>

<p id="id06807">"I thank you for the warning," said the count; "I shall endeavor to be
prepared for all suppositions."</p>

<p id="id06808">"You will, then, come on Saturday?"</p>

<p id="id06809">"Yes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me."</p>

<p id="id06810">"You are very kind."</p>

<p id="id06811">"Will M. Danglars be there?"</p>

<p id="id06812">"He has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade the
great d'Aguesseau, [*] M. de Villefort, to come, but have not much hope of
seeing him."</p>

<p id="id06813">"'Never despair of anything,' says the proverb."</p>

<p id="id06814">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;* Magistrate and orator of great eloquence&#8212;chancellor of<br/>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;France under Louis XV.<br/></p>

<p id="id06815">"Do you dance, count?"</p>

<p id="id06816">"I dance?"</p>

<p id="id06817">"Yes, you; it would not be astonishing."</p>

<p id="id06818">"That is very well before one is over forty. No, I do not dance, but I
like to see others do so. Does Madame de Morcerf dance?"</p>

<p id="id06819">"Never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation."</p>

<p id="id06820">"Indeed?"</p>

<p id="id06821">"Yes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have
heard her speak with interest." Albert rose and took his hat; the count
conducted him to the door. "I have one thing to reproach myself with,"
said he, stopping Albert on the steps. "What is it?"</p>

<p id="id06822">"I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars."</p>

<p id="id06823">"On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him."</p>

<p id="id06824">"I am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you aspect M.
d'Epinay?"</p>

<p id="id06825">"Five or six days hence at the latest."</p>

<p id="id06826">"And when is he to be married?"</p>

<p id="id06827">"Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Meran."</p>

<p id="id06828">"Bring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure you I
shall be happy to see him."</p>

<p id="id06829">"I will obey your orders, my lord."</p>

<p id="id06830">"Good-by."</p>

<p id="id06831">"Until Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?"</p>

<p id="id06832">"Yes, I promised you." The Count watched Albert, waving his hand to
him. When he had mounted his phaeton, Monte Cristo turned, and seeing
Bertuccio, "What news?" said he. "She went to the Palais," replied the
steward.</p>

<p id="id06833">"Did she stay long there?"</p>

<p id="id06834">"An hour and a half."</p>

<p id="id06835">"Did she return home?"</p>

<p id="id06836">"Directly."</p>

<p id="id06837">"Well, my dear Bertuccio," said the count, "I now advise you to go in
quest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy." Bertuccio
bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had
received, he started the same evening.</p>

<h2 id="id06838" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 69. The Inquiry.</h2>

<p id="id06839">M. de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars, to
endeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the
history of the house at Auteuil. He wrote the same day for the required
information to M. de Boville, who, from having been an inspector of
prisons, was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter
begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely
to give him full particulars. At the end of the second day M. de
Villefort received the following note:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06840">"The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate acquaintance
of Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen in Paris and
who is there at this moment; he is also known to the Abbe Busoni, a
Sicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has done much
good."</p>

<p id="id06841">M. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be
made respecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the
following evening he received these details:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06842">"The abbe, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small
two-storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each
floor and he was the only tenant. The two lower rooms consisted of a
dining-room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut,&#8212;and a
wainscoted parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece. It was
evident that the abbe limited himself to objects of strict necessity. He
preferred to use the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library than
parlor, and was furnished with theological books and parchments, in
which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time, according to
his valet de chambre. His valet looked at the visitors through a sort
of wicket; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him, he
replied that the abbe was not in Paris, an answer which satisfied most
persons, because the abbe was known to be a great traveller. Besides,
whether at home or not, whether in Paris or Cairo, the abbe always left
something to give away, which the valet distributed through this wicket
in his master's name. The other room near the library was a bedroom. A
bed without curtains, four arm-chairs, and a couch, covered with yellow
Utrecht velvet, composed, with a prie-Dieu, all its furniture. Lord
Wilmore resided in Rue Fontaine-Saint-George. He was one of those
English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling. He hired the
apartment in which he lived furnished, passed only a few hours in the
day there, and rarely slept there. One of his peculiarities was never to
speak a word of French, which he however wrote with great facility."</p>

<p id="id06843">The day after this important information had been given to the king's
attorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue
Ferou, and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the Abbe Busoni were
within. "No, he went out early this morning," replied the valet.</p>

<p id="id06844">"I might not always be content with that answer," replied the visitor,
"for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home. But have the
kindness to give the Abbe Busoni"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id06845">"I told you he was not at home," repeated the valet. "Then on his return
give him that card and this sealed paper. Will he be at home at eight
o'clock this evening?"</p>

<p id="id06846">"Doubtless, unless he is at work, which is the same as if he were out."</p>

<p id="id06847">"I will come again at that time," replied the visitor, who then retired.</p>

<p id="id06848">At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage, which,
instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Ferou, drove up to
the green door. He knocked, and it opened immediately to admit him.
From the signs of respect the valet paid him, he saw that his note had
produced a good effect. "Is the abbe at home?" asked he.</p>

<p id="id06849">"Yes; he is at work in his library, but he expects you, sir," replied
the valet. The stranger ascended a rough staircase, and before a table,
illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while
the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness, he perceived the abbe
in a monk's dress, with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned
men of the Middle Ages. "Have I the honor of addressing the Abbe
Busoni?" asked the visitor.</p>

<p id="id06850">"Yes, sir," replied the abbe; "and you are the person whom M. de
Boville, formerly an inspector of prisons, sends to me from the prefect
of police?"</p>

<p id="id06851">"Exactly, sir."</p>

<p id="id06852">"One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris?"</p>

<p id="id06853">"Yes, sir" replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing.</p>

<p id="id06854">The abbe replaced the large spectacles, which covered not only his eyes
but his temples, and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the
same. "I am at your service, sir," said the abbe, with a marked Italian
accent.</p>

<p id="id06855">"The mission with which I am charged, sir," replied the visitor,
speaking with hesitation, "is a confidential one on the part of him
who fulfils it, and him by whom he is employed." The abbe bowed. "Your
probity," replied the stranger, "is so well known to the prefect that he
wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected
with the public safety, to ascertain which I am deputed to see you. It
is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce
you to conceal the truth."</p>

<p id="id06856">"Provided, sir, the particulars you wish for do not interfere with
my scruples or my conscience. I am a priest, sir, and the secrets
of confession, for instance, must remain between me and God, and not
between me and human justice."</p>

<p id="id06857">"Do not alarm yourself, monsieur, we will duly respect your conscience."</p>

<p id="id06858">At this moment the abbe pressed down his side of the shade and so raised
it on the other, throwing a bright light on the stranger's face, while
his own remained obscured. "Excuse me, abbe," said the envoy of the
prefect of the police, "but the light tries my eyes very much." The abbe
lowered the shade. "Now, sir, I am listening&#8212;go on."</p>

<p id="id06859">"I will come at once to the point. Do you know the Count of Monte<br/>

Cristo?"<br/></p>

<p id="id06860">"You mean Monsieur Zaccone, I presume?"</p>

<p id="id06861">"Zaccone?&#8212;is not his name Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id06862">"Monte Cristo is the name of an estate, or, rather, of a rock, and not a
family name."</p>

<p id="id06863">"Well, be it so&#8212;let us not dispute about words; and since M. de Monte<br/>

Cristo and M. Zaccone are the same"&#8212;<br/></p>

<p id="id06864">"Absolutely the same."</p>

<p id="id06865">"Let us speak of M. Zaccone."</p>

<p id="id06866">"Agreed."</p>

<p id="id06867">"I asked you if you knew him?"</p>

<p id="id06868">"Extremely well."</p>

<p id="id06869">"Who is he?"</p>

<p id="id06870">"The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta."</p>

<p id="id06871">"I know that is the report; but, as you are aware, the police does not
content itself with vague reports."</p>

<p id="id06872">"However," replied the abbe, with an affable smile, "when that report is
in accordance with the truth, everybody must believe it, the police as
well as all the rest."</p>

<p id="id06873">"Are you sure of what you assert?"</p>

<p id="id06874">"What do you mean by that question?"</p>

<p id="id06875">"Understand, sir, I do not in the least suspect your veracity; I ask if
you are certain of it?"</p>

<p id="id06876">"I knew his father, M. Zaccone."</p>

<p id="id06877">"Ah, indeed?"</p>

<p id="id06878">"And when a child I often played with the son in the timber-yards."</p>

<p id="id06879">"But whence does he derive the title of count?"</p>

<p id="id06880">"You are aware that may be bought."</p>

<p id="id06881">"In Italy?"</p>

<p id="id06882">"Everywhere."</p>

<p id="id06883">"And his immense riches, whence does he procure them?"</p>

<p id="id06884">"They may not be so very great."</p>

<p id="id06885">"How much do you suppose he possesses?"</p>

<p id="id06886">"From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum."</p>

<p id="id06887">"That is reasonable," said the visitor; "I have heard he had three or
four millions."</p>

<p id="id06888">"Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital."</p>

<p id="id06889">"But I was told he had four millions per annum."</p>

<p id="id06890">"That is not probable."</p>

<p id="id06891">"Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id06892">"Certainly, every one who has come from Palermo, Naples, or Rome to
France by sea must know it, since he has passed close to it and must
have seen it."</p>

<p id="id06893">"I am told it is a delightful place?"</p>

<p id="id06894">"It is a rock."</p>

<p id="id06895">"And why has the count bought a rock?"</p>

<p id="id06896">"For the sake of being a count. In Italy one must have territorial
possessions to be a count."</p>

<p id="id06897">"You have, doubtless, heard the adventures of M. Zaccone's youth?"</p>

<p id="id06898">"The father's?"</p>

<p id="id06899">"No, the son's."</p>

<p id="id06900">"I know nothing certain; at that period of his life, I lost sight of my
young comrade."</p>

<p id="id06901">"Was he in the wars?"</p>

<p id="id06902">"I think he entered the service."</p>

<p id="id06903">"In what branch?"</p>

<p id="id06904">"In the navy."</p>

<p id="id06905">"Are you not his confessor?"</p>

<p id="id06906">"No, sir; I believe he is a Lutheran."</p>

<p id="id06907">"A Lutheran?"</p>

<p id="id06908">"I say, I believe such is the case, I do not affirm it; besides, liberty
of conscience is established in France."</p>

<p id="id06909">"Doubtless, and we are not now inquiring into his creed, but his
actions; in the name of the prefect of police, I ask you what you know
of him.</p>

<p id="id06910">"He passes for a very charitable man. Our holy father, the pope, has<br/>

made him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the<br/>

Christians in the East; he has five or six rings as testimonials from<br/>

Eastern monarchs of his services."<br/></p>

<p id="id06911">"Does he wear them?"</p>

<p id="id06912">"No, but he is proud of them; he is better pleased with rewards given to
the benefactors of man than to his destroyers."</p>

<p id="id06913">"He is a Quaker then?"</p>

<p id="id06914">"Exactly, he is a Quaker, with the exception of the peculiar dress."</p>

<p id="id06915">"Has he any friends?"</p>

<p id="id06916">"Yes, every one who knows him is his friend."</p>

<p id="id06917">"But has he any enemies?"</p>

<p id="id06918">"One only."</p>

<p id="id06919">"What is his name?"</p>

<p id="id06920">"Lord Wilmore."</p>

<p id="id06921">"Where is he?"</p>

<p id="id06922">"He is in Paris just now."</p>
