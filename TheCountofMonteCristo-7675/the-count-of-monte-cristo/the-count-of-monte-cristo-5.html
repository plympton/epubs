<p id="id01671">"What are you thinking of?" asked the abbe smilingly, imputing the deep
abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe
and wonder.</p>

<p id="id01672">"I was reflecting, in the first place," replied Dantes, "upon the
enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to
reach the high perfection to which you have attained. What would you not
have accomplished if you had been free?"</p>

<p id="id01673">"Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a
state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune
is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.
Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought
my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from
the collision of clouds electricity is produced&#8212;from electricity,
lightning, from lightning, illumination."</p>

<p id="id01674">"No," replied Dantes. "I know nothing. Some of your words are to me
quite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to possess the
knowledge you have."</p>

<p id="id01675">The abbe smiled. "Well," said he, "but you had another subject for your
thoughts; did you not say so just now?"</p>

<p id="id01676">"I did!"</p>

<p id="id01677">"You have told me as yet but one of them&#8212;let me hear the other."</p>

<p id="id01678">"It was this,&#8212;that while you had related to me all the particulars of
your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine."</p>

<p id="id01679">"Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit
of your having passed through any very important events."</p>

<p id="id01680">"It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved
misfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no
longer vent reproaches upon heaven."</p>

<p id="id01681">"Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?"</p>

<p id="id01682">"I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon
earth,&#8212;my father and Mercedes."</p>

<p id="id01683">"Come," said the abbe, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed
back to its original situation, "let me hear your story."</p>

<p id="id01684">Dantes obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which
consisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three
voyages to the Levant until he arrived at the recital of his last
cruise, with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet
to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that
personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter
addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier&#8212;his arrival at Marseilles, and
interview with his father&#8212;his affection for Mercedes, and their nuptual
feast&#8212;his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at
the Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the Chateau d'If.
From this point everything was a blank to Dantes&#8212;he knew nothing
more, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His recital
finished, the abbe reflected long and earnestly.</p>

<p id="id01685">"There is," said he, at the end of his meditations, "a clever maxim,
which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and
that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved
mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime.
Still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices, and
false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle
within us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and
wickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you
visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover
the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any
way advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,&#8212;to whom could your
disappearance have been serviceable?"</p>

<p id="id01686">"To no one, by heaven! I was a very insignificant person."</p>

<p id="id01687">"Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy;
everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king who stands
in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his rival out of
a place. Now, in the event of the king's death, his successor inherits a
crown,&#8212;when the employee dies, the supernumerary steps into his shoes,
and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres. Well, these twelve
thousand livres are his civil list, and are as essential to him as the
twelve millions of a king. Every one, from the highest to the lowest
degree, has his place on the social ladder, and is beset by stormy
passions and conflicting interests, as in Descartes' theory of pressure
and impulsion. But these forces increase as we go higher, so that we
have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on
the base. Now let us return to your particular world. You say you were
on the point of being made captain of the Pharaon?"</p>

<p id="id01688">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01689">"And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?"</p>

<p id="id01690">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01691">"Now, could any one have had any interest in preventing the
accomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the question
as to its being the interest of any one to hinder you from being captain
of the Pharaon. What say you?"</p>

<p id="id01692">"I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board, and
had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves, I
feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me. There was only one
person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had
quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to
fight me; but he refused."</p>

<p id="id01693">"Now we are getting on. And what was this man's name?"</p>

<p id="id01694">"Danglars."</p>

<p id="id01695">"What rank did he hold on board?"</p>

<p id="id01696">"He was supercargo."</p>

<p id="id01697">"And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his
employment?"</p>

<p id="id01698">"Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed
inaccuracies in his accounts."</p>

<p id="id01699">"Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last
conversation with Captain Leclere?"</p>

<p id="id01700">"No; we were quite alone."</p>

<p id="id01701">"Could your conversation have been overheard by any one?"</p>

<p id="id01702">"It might, for the cabin door was open&#8212;and&#8212;stay; now I
recollect,&#8212;Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was
giving me the packet for the grand marshal."</p>

<p id="id01703">"That's better," cried the abbe; "now we are on the right scent. Did you
take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?"</p>

<p id="id01704">"Nobody."</p>

<p id="id01705">"Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of
it, I think?"</p>

<p id="id01706">"Yes; the grand marshal did."</p>

<p id="id01707">"And what did you do with that letter?"</p>

<p id="id01708">"Put it into my portfolio."</p>

<p id="id01709">"You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find
room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official
letter?"</p>

<p id="id01710">"You are right; it was left on board."</p>

<p id="id01711">"Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in
the portfolio?"</p>

<p id="id01712">"No."</p>

<p id="id01713">"And what did you do with this same letter while returning from<br>

Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?"<br></p>

<p id="id01714">"I carried it in my hand."</p>

<p id="id01715">"So that when you went on board the Pharaon, everybody could see that
you held a letter in your hand?"</p>

<p id="id01716">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01717">"Danglars, as well as the rest?"</p>

<p id="id01718">"Danglars, as well as others."</p>

<p id="id01719">"Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your
arrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against you
was formulated?"</p>

<p id="id01720">"Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my
memory."</p>

<p id="id01721">"Repeat it to me."</p>

<p id="id01722">Dantes paused a moment, then said, "This is it, word for word: 'The
king's attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion,
that one Edmond Dantes, mate on board the Pharaon, this day arrived
from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been
intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper,
with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of his guilt
may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be found
either about his person, at his father's residence, or in his cabin
on board the Pharaon.'" The abbe shrugged his shoulders. "The thing is
clear as day," said he; "and you must have had a very confiding nature,
as well as a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole
affair."</p>

<p id="id01723">"Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous."</p>

<p id="id01724">"How did Danglars usually write?"</p>

<p id="id01725">"In a handsome, running hand."</p>

<p id="id01726">"And how was the anonymous letter written?"</p>

<p id="id01727">"Backhanded." Again the abbe smiled. "Disguised."</p>

<p id="id01728">"It was very boldly written, if disguised."</p>

<p id="id01729">"Stop a bit," said the abbe, taking up what he called his pen, and,
after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen,
with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.
Dantes drew back, and gazed on the abbe with a sensation almost
amounting to terror.</p>

<p id="id01730">"How very astonishing!" cried he at length. "Why your writing exactly
resembles that of the accusation."</p>

<p id="id01731">"Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and<br>

I have noticed that"&#8212;<br></p>

<p id="id01732">"What?"</p>

<p id="id01733">"That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand
varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform."</p>

<p id="id01734">"You have evidently seen and observed everything."</p>

<p id="id01735">"Let us proceed."</p>

<p id="id01736">"Oh, yes, yes!"</p>

<p id="id01737">"Now as regards the second question."</p>

<p id="id01738">"I am listening."</p>

<p id="id01739">"Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage
with Mercedes?"</p>

<p id="id01740">"Yes; a young man who loved her."</p>

<p id="id01741">"And his name was"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01742">"Fernand."</p>

<p id="id01743">"That is a Spanish name, I think?"</p>

<p id="id01744">"He was a Catalan."</p>

<p id="id01745">"You imagine him capable of writing the letter?"</p>

<p id="id01746">"Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife
into me."</p>

<p id="id01747">"That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an
assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice,
never."</p>

<p id="id01748">"Besides," said Dantes, "the various circumstances mentioned in the
letter were wholly unknown to him."</p>

<p id="id01749">"You had never spoken of them yourself to any one?"</p>

<p id="id01750">"To no one."</p>

<p id="id01751">"Not even to your mistress?"</p>

<p id="id01752">"No, not even to my betrothed."</p>

<p id="id01753">"Then it is Danglars."</p>

<p id="id01754">"I feel quite sure of it now."</p>

<p id="id01755">"Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?"</p>

<p id="id01756">"No&#8212;yes, he was. Now I recollect"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01757">"What?"</p>

<p id="id01758">"To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Pere
Pamphile's the evening before the day fixed for my wedding. They were in
earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way, but Fernand
looked pale and agitated."</p>

<p id="id01759">"Were they alone?"</p>

<p id="id01760">"There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who
had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named
Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!&#8212;stay!&#8212;How strange that it
should not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well, that
on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.
Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!" exclaimed Dantes, pressing
his hand to his throbbing brows.</p>

<p id="id01761">"Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the
villany of your friends?" inquired the abbe with a laugh.</p>

<p id="id01762">"Yes, yes," replied Dantes eagerly; "I would beg of you, who see so
completely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest mystery
seems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I underwent
no second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above all, was
condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?"</p>

<p id="id01763">"That is altogether a different and more serious matter," responded the
abbe. "The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to
be easily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the matter has been
child's play. If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of
the business, you must assist me by the most minute information on every
point."</p>

<p id="id01764">"Pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you see
more clearly into my life than I do myself."</p>

<p id="id01765">"In the first place, then, who examined you,&#8212;the king's attorney, his
deputy, or a magistrate?"</p>

<p id="id01766">"The deputy."</p>

<p id="id01767">"Was he young or old?"</p>

<p id="id01768">"About six or seven and twenty years of age, I should say."</p>

<p id="id01769">"So," answered the abbe. "Old enough to be ambitions, but too young to
be corrupt. And how did he treat you?"</p>

<p id="id01770">"With more of mildness than severity."</p>

<p id="id01771">"Did you tell him your whole story?"</p>

<p id="id01772">"I did."</p>

<p id="id01773">"And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?"</p>

<p id="id01774">"He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought
me into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune."</p>

<p id="id01775">"By your misfortune?"</p>

<p id="id01776">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01777">"Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?"</p>

<p id="id01778">"He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate."</p>

<p id="id01779">"And that?"</p>

<p id="id01780">"He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me."</p>

<p id="id01781">"What? the accusation?"</p>

<p id="id01782">"No; the letter."</p>

<p id="id01783">"Are you sure?"</p>

<p id="id01784">"I saw it done."</p>

<p id="id01785">"That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater scoundrel
than you have thought possible."</p>

<p id="id01786">"Upon my word," said Dantes, "you make me shudder. Is the world filled
with tigers and crocodiles?"</p>

<p id="id01787">"Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more
dangerous than the others."</p>

<p id="id01788">"Never mind; let us go on."</p>

<p id="id01789">"With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?"</p>

<p id="id01790">"He did; saying at the same time, 'You see I thus destroy the only proof
existing against you.'"</p>

<p id="id01791">"This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural."</p>

<p id="id01792">"You think so?"</p>

<p id="id01793">"I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?"</p>

<p id="id01794">"To M. Noirtier, No. 13 Coq-Heron, Paris."</p>

<p id="id01795">"Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could
possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?"</p>

<p id="id01796">"Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me
promise several times never to speak of that letter to any one, assuring
me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he
insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in
the address."</p>

<p id="id01797">"Noirtier!" repeated the abbe; "Noirtier!&#8212;I knew a person of that
name at the court of the Queen of Etruria,&#8212;a Noirtier, who had been a
Girondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?"</p>

<p id="id01798">"De Villefort!" The abbe burst into a fit of laughter, while Dantes
gazed on him in utter astonishment.</p>

<p id="id01799">"What ails you?" said he at length.</p>

<p id="id01800">"Do you see that ray of sunlight?"</p>

<p id="id01801">"I do."</p>

<p id="id01802">"Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.
Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed
great sympathy and commiseration for you?"</p>

<p id="id01803">"He did."</p>

<p id="id01804">"And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?"</p>

<p id="id01805">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01806">"And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?"</p>

<p id="id01807">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01808">"Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this<br>

Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed?<br>

Noirtier was his father."<br></p>

<p id="id01809">Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantes, or hell opened its
yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely
transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected
words. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to
prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, "His father! his
father!"</p>

<p id="id01810">"Yes, his father," replied the abbe; "his right name was Noirtier de
Villefort." At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of
Dantes, and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before.
The change that had come over Villefort during the examination, the
destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating
tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to
pronounce punishment,&#8212;all returned with a stunning force to his memory.
He cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then
he hurried to the opening that led from the abbe's cell to his own, and
said, "I must be alone, to think over all this."</p>

<p id="id01811">When he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the
turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and
contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these hours
of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had
formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a
solemn oath.</p>

<p id="id01812">Dantes was at length roused from his revery by the voice of Faria,
who, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his
fellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his
mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the
abbe unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter
quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a
small quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbe had come to
ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him. Dantes followed;
his features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual
expression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one
who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria bent on him his
penetrating eye: "I regret now," said he, "having helped you in your
late inquiries, or having given you the information I did."</p>

<p id="id01813">"Why so?" inquired Dantes.</p>

<p id="id01814">"Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart&#8212;that of
vengeance."</p>

<p id="id01815">Dantes smiled. "Let us talk of something else," said he.</p>

<p id="id01816">Again the abbe looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in
accordance with Dantes' request, he began to speak of other matters. The
elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that
of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful
and important hints as well as sound information; but it was never
egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.
Dantes listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his
remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort
of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of the
good abbe's words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but,
like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened
new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic
glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an
intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria
along the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.</p>

<p id="id01817">"You must teach me a small part of what you know," said Dantes, "if only
to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so learned
a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented
with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself. If you
will only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention another
word about escaping." The abbe smiled. "Alas, my boy," said he, "human
knowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when I have
taught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four modern
languages with which I am acquainted, you will know as much as I do
myself. Now, it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to
you the stock of learning I possess."</p>

<p id="id01818">"Two years!" exclaimed Dantes; "do you really believe I can acquire all
these things in so short a time?"</p>

<p id="id01819">"Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to
learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory
makes the one, philosophy the other."</p>

<p id="id01820">"But cannot one learn philosophy?"</p>

<p id="id01821">"Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to
truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into
heaven."</p>

<p id="id01822">"Well, then," said Dantes, "What shall you teach me first? I am in a
hurry to begin. I want to learn."</p>

<p id="id01823">"Everything," said the abbe. And that very evening the prisoners
sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.
Dantes possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing
quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his
mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally
poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality
of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He
already knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic
dialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two
languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so
that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and
German. In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbe, Dantes
spoke no more of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him
left no room for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had
pledged his word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from
referring in any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months,
passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of
a year Dantes was a new man. Dantes observed, however, that Faria, in
spite of the relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought
seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would
fall into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly
rise, and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his
dungeon. One day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed, "Ah, if there
were no sentinel!"</p>

<p id="id01824">"There shall not be one a minute longer than you please," said Dantes,
who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though
his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest
operations.</p>

<p id="id01825">"I have already told you," answered the abbe, "that I loathe the idea of
shedding blood."</p>

<p id="id01826">"And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a
measure of self-preservation."</p>

<p id="id01827">"No matter! I could never agree to it."</p>

<p id="id01828">"Still, you have thought of it?"</p>

<p id="id01829">"Incessantly, alas!" cried the abbe.</p>

<p id="id01830">"And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you
not?" asked Dantes eagerly.</p>

<p id="id01831">"I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in
the gallery beyond us."</p>

<p id="id01832">"He shall be both blind and deaf," replied the young man, with an air of
determination that made his companion shudder.</p>

<p id="id01833">"No, no," cried the abbe; "impossible!" Dantes endeavored to renew the
subject; the abbe shook his head in token of disapproval, and refused to
make any further response. Three months passed away.</p>

<p id="id01834">"Are you strong?" the abbe asked one day of Dantes. The young man, in
reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and
then as readily straightened it.</p>

<p id="id01835">"And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last
resort?"</p>

<p id="id01836">"I promise on my honor."</p>

<p id="id01837">"Then," said the abbe, "we may hope to put our design into execution."</p>

<p id="id01838">"And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?"</p>

<p id="id01839">"At least a year."</p>

<p id="id01840">"And shall we begin at once?"</p>

<p id="id01841">"At once."</p>

<p id="id01842">"We have lost a year to no purpose!" cried Dantes.</p>

<p id="id01843">"Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?" asked the
abbe.</p>

<p id="id01844">"Forgive me!" cried Edmond, blushing deeply.</p>

<p id="id01845">"Tut, tut!" answered the abbe, "man is but man after all, and you are
about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me
show you my plan." The abbe then showed Dantes the sketch he had made
for their escape. It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of
Dantes, with the passage which united them. In this passage he proposed
to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two
prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch;
once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones
with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the
desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who,
stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantes
before he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were then to
make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let themselves
down from the outer walls by means of the abbe's ladder of cords.
Dantes' eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at
the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed.</p>

<p id="id01846">That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity
proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of
ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work
except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in
anticipation of the turnkey's visits. They had learned to distinguish
the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards
their dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his
coming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which
would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees
and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria's
or Dantes' cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the
night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to
remain. More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only
tools for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria
still continuing to instruct Dantes by conversing with him, sometimes
in one language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the
history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to
fame and trodden the path of glory.</p>

<p id="id01847">The abbe was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first
society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantes,
thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily
acquired, as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before
been wanting in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who
have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and
breeding. At the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the
excavation completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could
distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and
fro over their heads.</p>

<p id="id01848">Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor
their flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that
auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the
stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before
its right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by
propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the
walls through which they had worked their way. Dantes was occupied in
arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained
in Edmond's cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their
rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering. Dantes
hastened to his dungeon, where he found him standing in the middle of
the room, pale as death, his forehead streaming with perspiration, and
his hands clinched tightly together.</p>

<p id="id01849">"Gracious heavens!" exclaimed Dantes, "what is the matter? what has
happened?"</p>

<p id="id01850">"Quick! quick!" returned the abbe, "listen to what I have to say."
Dantes looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria,
whose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles,
while his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair seemed
to stand on end.</p>

<p id="id01851">"Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?" cried Dantes, letting his
chisel fall to the floor.</p>

<p id="id01852">"Alas," faltered out the abbe, "all is over with me. I am seized with a
terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is
fast approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my
imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you what
that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet
that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the
purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with
a red-looking fluid. Bring it to me&#8212;or rather&#8212;no, no!&#8212;I may be found
here, therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to
drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may
last?"</p>

<p id="id01853">In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly
frustrated his hopes, Dantes did not lose his presence of mind, but
descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him;
then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbe's
chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.</p>

<p id="id01854">"Thanks," said the poor abbe, shivering as though his veins were filled
with ice. "I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it
comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though
dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms
may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions,
foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries are not heard,
for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another
part of the prison, and we be separated forever. When I become quite
motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not before,&#8212;be
careful about this,&#8212;force open my teeth with the knife, pour from eight
to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat, and I
may perhaps revive."</p>

<p id="id01855">"Perhaps!" exclaimed Dantes in grief-stricken tones.</p>

<p id="id01856">"Help! help!" cried the abbe, "I&#8212;I&#8212;die&#8212;I"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01857">So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was
unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole
frame, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one
side, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself
about, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantes
prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The
fit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and
paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under
foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as
rigid as a corpse.</p>

<p id="id01858">Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,
taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely
fixed jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and
anxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave
no sign of returning animation. Dantes began to fear he had delayed too
long ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his
hair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At length
a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the
dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer
made a feeble effort to move.</p>

<p id="id01859">"He is saved! he is saved!" cried Dantes in a paroxysm of delight.</p>

<p id="id01860">The sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident
anxiety towards the door. Dantes listened, and plainly distinguished the
approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven o'clock;
but Edmond's anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head. The
young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing
the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had scarcely
done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated
as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had turned in the
lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in
the long corridor he had to traverse, Dantes, whose restless anxiety
concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him,
hurried back to the abbe's chamber, and raising the stone by pressing
his head against it, was soon beside the sick man's couch. Faria had
now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and
exhausted.</p>

<p id="id01861">"I did not expect to see you again," said he feebly, to Dantes.</p>

<p id="id01862">"And why not?" asked the young man. "Did you fancy yourself dying?"</p>

<p id="id01863">"No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I
thought you might have made your escape." The deep glow of indignation
suffused the cheeks of Dantes.</p>

<p id="id01864">"Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?"</p>

<p id="id01865">"At least," said the abbe, "I now see how wrong such an opinion would
have been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this
attack."</p>

<p id="id01866">"Be of good cheer," replied Dantes; "your strength will return." And
as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria, and took his
hands. The abbe shook his head.</p>

<p id="id01867">"The last attack I had," said he, "lasted but half an hour, and after it
I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my right
arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that there
has been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack will either
carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life."</p>

<p id="id01868">"No, no," cried Dantes; "you are mistaken&#8212;you will not die! And your
third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at
liberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only with
a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command every
requisite assistance."</p>

<p id="id01869">"My good Edmond," answered the abbe, "be not deceived. The attack which
has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison. None
can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk."</p>

<p id="id01870">"Well, we will wait,&#8212;a week, a month, two months, if need be,&#8212;and
meanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our
flight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able
to swim we will go."</p>

<p id="id01871">"I shall never swim again," replied Faria. "This arm is paralyzed; not
for a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken." The
young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight, perfectly
inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.</p>

<p id="id01872">"You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?" asked the abbe. "Depend
upon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of this
malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it, for
it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of it
in a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have
twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated Cabanis, and
he predicted a similar end for me."</p>

<p id="id01873">"The physician may be mistaken!" exclaimed Dantes. "And as for your poor
arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my shoulders, and
swim for both of us."</p>

<p id="id01874">"My son," said the abbe, "you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must know
as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty
strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes, that
even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I shall
remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all human
probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young
and active, delay not on my account, but fly&#8212;go&#8212;I give you back your
promise."</p>

<p id="id01875">"It is well," said Dantes. "Then I shall also remain." Then, rising and
extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man's head, he
slowly added, "By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while
you live."</p>

<p id="id01876">Faria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled
young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the
sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.</p>

<p id="id01877">"Thanks," murmured the invalid, extending one hand. "I accept. You may
one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But
as I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary
to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier's gallery; he might, by
chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention
of his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery
which would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set
about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance;
keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here to-morrow
till after the jailer his visited me. I shall have something of the
greatest importance to communicate to you."</p>

<p id="id01878">Dantes took the hand of the abbe in his, and affectionately pressed
it. Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his
task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show
towards his aged friend.</p>

<h2 id="id01879" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 18. The Treasure.</h2>

<p id="id01880">When Dantes returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in
captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of
light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in
his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the
use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small
compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He
did not speak, but showed the paper to Dantes.</p>

<p id="id01881">"What is that?" he inquired.</p>

<p id="id01882">"Look at it," said the abbe with a smile.</p>

<p id="id01883">"I have looked at it with all possible attention," said Dantes, "and I
only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters
inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink."</p>

<p id="id01884">"This paper, my friend," said Faria, "I may now avow to you, since I
have the proof of your fidelity&#8212;this paper is my treasure, of which,
from this day forth, one-half belongs to you."</p>

<p id="id01885">The sweat started forth on Dantes brow. Until this day and for how
long a time!&#8212;he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had
brought upon the abbe the accusation of madness. With his instinctive
delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord,
and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old
man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria,
after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into
mental alienation.</p>

<p id="id01886">"Your treasure?" stammered Dantes. Faria smiled.</p>

<p id="id01887">"Yes," said he. "You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see
by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this
moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantes, and
if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes&#8212;you. No one
would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you,
who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards
if you will."</p>

<p id="id01888">"Alas," murmured Edmond to himself, "this is a terrible relapse! There
was only this blow wanting." Then he said aloud, "My dear friend, your
attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile?
To-morrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but to-day I wish
to nurse you carefully. Besides," he said, "a treasure is not a thing we
need hurry about."</p>

<p id="id01889">"On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!"
replied the old man. "Who knows if to-morrow, or the next day after,
the third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes,
indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which
would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those
men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted
it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity.
But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see
you, young and with a promising future,&#8212;now that I think of all that
may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder
at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as
yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth." Edmond
turned away his head with a sigh.</p>

<p id="id01890">"You persist in your incredulity, Edmond," continued Faria. "My words
have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this
paper, which I have never shown to any one."</p>

<p id="id01891">"To-morrow, my dear friend," said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to
the old man's madness. "I thought it was understood that we should not
talk of that until to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id01892">"Then we will not talk of it until to-morrow; but read this paper
to-day."</p>

<p id="id01893">"I will not irritate him," thought Edmond, and taking the paper,
of which half was wanting,&#8212;having been burnt, no doubt, by some
accident,&#8212;he read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01894">"This treasure, which may amount to two&#8230; of Roman crowns in the most
distant a&#8230; of the second opening wh&#8230; declare to belong to him alo&#8230;
heir. "25th April, 149-"</p>

<p id="id01895">"Well!" said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.</p>

<p id="id01896">"Why," replied Dantes, "I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected
words, which are rendered illegible by fire."</p>

<p id="id01897">"Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not
for me, who have grown pale over them by many nights' study, and have
reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought."</p>

<p id="id01898">"And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?"</p>

<p id="id01899">"I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to
the history of this paper."</p>

<p id="id01900">"Silence!" exclaimed Dantes. "Steps approach&#8212;I go&#8212;adieu."</p>

<p id="id01901">And Dantes, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be
sure to confirm his belief in his friend's mental instability, glided
like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his
alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with
his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to
avoid discovery.</p>

<p id="id01902">It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria's illness from the jailer,
had come in person to see him.</p>

<p id="id01903">Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he
might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half
stricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched
with pity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus
separate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the
case, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for
whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a
slight indisposition.</p>

<p id="id01904">During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,
tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first
acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so
wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much
wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as
to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?</p>

<p id="id01905">Dantes remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his friend,
thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced, once for
all, that the abbe was mad&#8212;such a conviction would be so terrible!</p>

<p id="id01906">But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone
by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over
the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard the
painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his
leg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was
obliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to
enter by the small aperture which led to Dantes' chamber.</p>

<p id="id01907">"Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly," he said with a benignant smile.<br>

"You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen to me."<br></p>

<p id="id01908">Edmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he
seated himself on the stool beside him.</p>

<p id="id01909">"You know," said the abbe, "that I was the secretary and intimate friend
of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe to this
worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich, although the
wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I heard the phrase
very often, 'As rich as a Spada.' But he, like public rumor, lived on
this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise. I was tutor to
his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the world, I tried
by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all he had done for
me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The cardinal's house had
no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient
volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts. One day
when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches, and deploring
the prostration of mind that followed them, he looked at me, and,
smiling bitterly, opened a volume relating to the History of the City of
Rome. There, in the twentieth chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI.,
were the following lines, which I can never forget:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01910">"'The great wars of Romagna had ended; Caesar Borgia, who had completed
his conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope had also
need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of France,
who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was
necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme,
which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition
of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two
cardinals.'</p>

<p id="id01911">"By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich
men&#8212;this was the return the holy father looked for. In the first place,
he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the
cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides.
There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter. The
pope and Caesar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were
Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the
Holy See, and Caesar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman
nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope.
They were ambitious, and Caesar Borgia soon found purchasers for their
appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being
cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals
held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns
entered into the coffers of the speculators.</p>

<p id="id01912">"It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The pope
heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the
insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs
and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Caesar Borgia
invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute
between the holy father and his son. Caesar thought they could make use
of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends, that is
to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to certain
persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard.
This key was furnished with a small iron point,&#8212;a negligence on the
part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the opening of
the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person was pricked
by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the ring with the
lion's head, which Caesar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with
a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the
end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal. Caesar proposed to his
father, that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard,
or shake hands with them; but Alexander VI., replied: 'Now as to the
worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us ask both of them to
dinner, something tells me that we shall get that money back. Besides,
you forget, Caesar, an indigestion declares itself immediately, while
a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.' Caesar gave
way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were consequently
invited to dinner.</p>

<p id="id01913">"The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San
Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by
report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a
good appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man,
and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest
promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his
nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant
did not find him.</p>

<p id="id01914">"Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so
eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a
centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, 'Caesar wills that
you die.' but it was a legate a latere, who came with a smile on his
lips to say from the pope, 'His holiness requests you to dine with him.'</p>

<p id="id01915">"Spada set out about two o'clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited
him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of
his nephew, in full costume, and Caesar Borgia paying him most marked
attentions. Spada turned pale, as Caesar looked at him with an ironical
air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was
well spread. They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his
nephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly
comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had
already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the
pope's butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him,
which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared
they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the
threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making
signs which his wife could not comprehend.</p>

<p id="id01916">"Then Caesar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under
presence of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance
consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:&#8212;'I
bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others,
my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in
remembrance of his affectionate uncle.'</p>

<p id="id01917">"The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the
furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was
really the most miserable of uncles&#8212;no treasures&#8212;unless they were
those of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was
all. Caesar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found
nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in
plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say
to his wife before he expired: 'Look well among my uncle's papers; there
is a will.'</p>

<p id="id01918">"They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but it
was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine
Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two
palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath
the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on.
Alexander VI. died, poisoned,&#8212;you know by what mistake. Caesar,
poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake;
but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a
tiger's. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely
killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history. After the
pope's death and his son's exile, it was supposed that the Spada family
would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal's
time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in doubtful ease,
a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was, that
Caesar, a better politician than his father, had carried off from the
pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two, because Cardinal
Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was completely despoiled.</p>

<p id="id01919">"Up to this point," said Faria, interrupting the thread of his
narrative, "this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?"</p>

<p id="id01920">"Oh, my friend," cried Dantes, "on the contrary, it seems as if I were
reading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you."</p>

<p id="id01921">"I will."</p>

<p id="id01922">"The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years rolled
on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomatists;
some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some were ruined. I
come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was&#8212;the Count of
Spada. I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank
with his fortune; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity.
He did so, and thus doubled his income. The celebrated breviary remained
in the family, and was in the count's possession. It had been handed
down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will
that had been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic,
preserved in the family with superstitious veneration. It was an
illuminated book, with beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with
gold, that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of
great solemnity.</p>

<p id="id01923">"At the sight of papers of all sorts,&#8212;titles, contracts, parchments,
which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from
the poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of
documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but
in spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found&#8212;nothing. Yet I had
read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for
the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had
occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Caesar Spada; but could
only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi,
his companion in misfortune.</p>

<p id="id01924">"I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the
Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures
of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the
eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand
and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three
hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the
Count of Spada in his poverty. My patron died. He had reserved from
his annuity his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand
volumes, and his famous breviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a
thousand Roman crowns, which he had in ready money, on condition that I
would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul, and that
I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house. All this I
did scrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.</p>

<p id="id01925">"In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death
of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently
how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the
thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold
to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence,
intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my
library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor
at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my
head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o'clock in the
afternoon. I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head;
I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but as no one came, I
determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the
simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting.
I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a
piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to
get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing,
however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a
moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which
was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and
which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of
the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting
it into the expiring flame, set light to it.</p>

<p id="id01926">"But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire
ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it
in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper
in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible
emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been
traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to
the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame.
It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantes, and then
I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense."</p>

<p id="id01927">Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantes, who this
time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color
resembling rust:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01928" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     "This 25th day of April, 1498, be&#8230;
     Alexander VI., and fearing that not&#8230;
     he may desire to become my heir, and re&#8230;
     and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,&#8230;
     my sole heir, that I have bu&#8230;
     and has visited with me, that is, in&#8230;

     may amount to nearly two mil&#8230;

     creek to the east in a right line. Two open&#8230;

     which treasure I bequeath and leave en&#8230;
     as my sole heir.
     "25th April, 1498.
     "Caes&#8230;</p>

<p id="id01929">"And now," said the abbe, "read this other paper;" and he presented to
Dantes a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it, which Edmond
read as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01931">Faria followed him with an excited look, "and now," he said, when he saw
that Dantes had read the last line, "put the two fragments together, and
judge for yourself." Dantes obeyed, and the conjointed pieces gave the
following:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01932">"This 25th day of April, 1498, be&#8230;ing invited to dine by his Holiness
Alexander VI., and fearing that not&#8230;content with making me pay for my

Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned&#8230;I declare to my
nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, that I have bu&#8230;ried in a place

diamonds, gems; that I alone&#8230;know of the existence of this treasure,
which may amount to nearly two mil&#8230;lions of Roman crowns, and which he
will find on raising the twentieth ro&#8230;ck from the small creek to the
east in a right line. Two open&#8230;ings have been made in these caves;
the treasure is in the furthest a&#8230;ngle in the second; which treasure I
bequeath and leave en&#8230;tire to him as my sole heir. "25th April, 1498.
"Caes&#8230;ar Spada."</p>

<p id="id01933">"Well, do you comprehend now?" inquired Faria.</p>

<p id="id01934">"It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought
for," replied Edmond, still incredulous.</p>

<p id="id01935">"Yes; a thousand times, yes!"</p>

<p id="id01936">"And who completed it as it now is?"</p>

<p id="id01937">"I did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring
the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden
meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a
cavern by the small ray of light above us."</p>

<p id="id01938">"And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?"</p>

<p id="id01939">"I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying
with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian
kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period,
quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to
him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my
hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having
aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was
leaving Piombino.</p>

<p id="id01940">"Now," continued Faria, addressing Dantes with an almost paternal
expression, "now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If
we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and
you escape alone, the whole belongs to you."</p>

<p id="id01941">"But," inquired Dantes hesitating, "has this treasure no more legitimate
possessor in the world than ourselves?"</p>

<p id="id01942">"No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count
of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic
breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind
satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy
it without remorse."</p>

<p id="id01943">"And you say this treasure amounts to"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id01944">"Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our
money." [*]</p>

<p id="id01945">     * $2,600,000 in 1894.</p>

<p id="id01946">"Impossible!" said Dantes, staggered at the enormous amount.</p>

<p id="id01947">"Impossible? and why?" asked the old man. "The Spada family was one of
the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in
those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such
accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at
this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly
a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they
cannot touch." Edmond thought he was in a dream&#8212;he wavered between
incredulity and joy.</p>

<p id="id01948">"I have only kept this secret so long from you," continued Faria, "that
I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped
before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte
Cristo; now," he added, with a sigh, "it is you who will conduct me
thither. Well, Dantes, you do not thank me?"</p>

<p id="id01949">"This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend," replied Dantes, "and to
you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours."</p>

<p id="id01950">"You are my son, Dantes," exclaimed the old man. "You are the child of
my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you
to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a
father, and the prisoner who could not get free." And Faria extended the
arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw
himself upon his neck and wept.</p>
