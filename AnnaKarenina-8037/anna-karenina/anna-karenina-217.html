<h2 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Chapter 21</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span>After a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at
Bartnyansky&#8217;s, Stepan Arkadyevitch, only a little later than the
appointed time, went in to Countess Lidia Ivanovna&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Who else is with the countess?&#8212;a Frenchman?" Stepan
Arkadyevitch asked the hall porter, as he glanced at the familiar
overcoat of Alexey Alexandrovitch and a queer, rather
artless-looking overcoat with clasps.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov," the porter
answered severely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Princess Myakaya guessed right," thought Stepan Arkadyevitch, as
he went upstairs. "Curious! It would be quite as well, though,
to get on friendly terms with her. She has immense influence.
If she would say a word to Pomorsky, the thing would be a
certainty."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was still quite light out-of-doors, but in Countess Lidia
Ivanovna&#8217;s little drawing room the blinds were drawn and the
lamps lighted. At a round table under a lamp sat the countess
and Alexey Alexandrovitch, talking softly. A short, thinnish
man, very pale and handsome, with feminine hips and knock-kneed
legs, with fine brilliant eyes and long hair lying on the collar
of his coat, was standing at the end of the room gazing at the
portraits on the wall. After greeting the lady of the house and
Alexey Alexandrovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch could not resist
glancing once more at the unknown man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Monsieur Landau!" the countess addressed him with a softness and
caution that impressed Oblonsky. And she introduced them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Landau looked round hurriedly, came up, and smiling, laid his
moist, lifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevitch&#8217;s outstretched hand
and immediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits
again. The countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at each
other significantly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am very glad to see you, particularly today," said Countess
Lidia Ivanovna, pointing Stepan Arkadyevitch to a seat beside
Karenin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I introduced you to him as Landau," she said in a soft voice,
glancing at the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexey
Alexandrovitch, "but he is really Count Bezzubov, as you&#8217;re
probably aware. Only he does not like the title."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, I heard so," answered Stepan Arkadyevitch; "they say he
completely cured Countess Bezzubova."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"She was here today, poor thing!" the countess said, turning to
Alexey Alexandrovitch. "This separation is awful for her. It&#8217;s
such a blow to her!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And he positively is going?" queried Alexey Alexandrovitch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, he&#8217;s going to Paris. He heard a voice yesterday," said
Countess Lidia Ivanovna, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, a voice!" repeated Oblonsky, feeling that he must be as
circumspect as he possibly could in this society, where something
peculiar was going on, or was to go on, to which he had not the
key.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A moment&#8217;s silence followed, after which Countess Lidia Ivanovna,
as though approaching the main topic of conversation, said with a
fine smile to Oblonsky:</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I&#8217;ve known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a
closer acquaintance with you. </span><em class="italics">Les amis de nos amis sont nos
amis.</em><span> But to be a true friend, one must enter into the spiritual
state of one&#8217;s friend, and I fear that you are not doing so in
the case of Alexey Alexandrovitch. You understand what I mean?"
she said, lifting her fine pensive eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In part, countess, I understand the position of Alexey
Alexandrovitch..." said Oblonsky. Having no clear idea what they
were talking about, he wanted to confine himself to generalities.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The change is not in his external position," Countess Lidia
Ivanovna said sternly, following with eyes of love the figure of
Alexey Alexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to Landau;
"his heart is changed, a new heart has been vouchsafed him, and
I fear you don&#8217;t fully apprehend the change that has taken place
in him."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, well, in general outlines I can conceive the change. We
have always been friendly, and now..." said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
responding with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the
countess, and mentally balancing the question with which of the
two ministers she was most intimate, so as to know about which to
ask her to speak for him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love
for his neighbors; on the contrary, that change can only
intensify love in his heart. But I am afraid you do not
understand me. Won&#8217;t you have some tea?" she said, with her eyes
indicating the footman, who was handing round tea on a tray.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not quite, countess. Of course, his misfortune..."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness, when
his heart was made new, was filled full of it," she said, gazing
with eyes full of love at Stepan Arkadyevitch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them," thought
Stepan Arkadyevitch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, of course, countess," he said; "but I imagine such changes
are a matter so private that no one, even the most intimate
friend, would care to speak of them."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"On the contrary! We ought to speak freely and help one
another."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, undoubtedly so, but there is such a difference of
convictions, and besides..." said Oblonsky with a soft smile.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There can be no difference where it is a question of holy
truth."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, no, of course; but..." and Stepan Arkadyevitch paused in
confusion. He understood at last that they were talking of
religion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I fancy he will fall asleep immediately," said Alexey
Alexandrovitch in a whisper full of meaning, going up to Lidia
Ivanovna.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Stepan Arkadyevitch looked round. Landau was sitting at the
window, leaning on his elbow and the back of his chair, his head
drooping. Noticing that all eyes were turned on him he raised
his head and smiled a smile of childlike artlessness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Don&#8217;t take any notice," said Lidia Ivanovna, and she lightly
moved a chair up for Alexey Alexandrovitch. "I have observed..."
she was beginning, when a footman came into the room with a
letter. Lidia Ivanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note, and
excusing herself, wrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity,
handed it to the man, and came back to the table. "I have
observed," she went on, "that Moscow people, especially the men,
are more indifferent to religion than anyone."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, no, countess, I thought Moscow people had the reputation of
being the firmest in the faith," answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of the
indifferent ones," said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning to him
with a weary smile.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How anyone can be indifferent!" said Lidia Ivanovna.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in
suspense," said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his most deprecating
smile. "I hardly think that the time for such questions has come
yet for me."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not," said
Alexey Alexandrovitch severely. "We ought not to think whether
we are ready or not ready. God&#8217;s grace is not guided by human
considerations: sometimes it comes not to those that strive for
it, and comes to those that are unprepared, like Saul."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, I believe it won&#8217;t be just yet," said Lidia Ivanovna, who
had been meanwhile watching the movements of the Frenchman.
Landau got up and came to them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do you allow me to listen?" he asked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you," said Lidia Ivanovna,
gazing tenderly at him; "sit here with us."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"One has only not to close one&#8217;s eyes to shut out the light,"
Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, if you knew the happiness we know, feeling His presence ever
in our hearts!" said Countess Lidia Ivanovna with a rapturous
smile.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that
height," said Stepan Arkadyevitch, conscious of hypocrisy in
admitting this religious height, but at the same time unable to
bring himself to acknowledge his free-thinking views before a
person who, by a single word to Pomorsky, might procure him the
coveted appointment.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?" said Lidia Ivanovna.
"But that is a false idea. There is no sin for believers, their
sin has been atoned for. </span><em class="italics">Pardon,</em><span>" she added, looking at the
footman, who came in again with another letter. She read it and
gave a verbal answer: "Tomorrow at the Grand Duchess&#8217;s, say."
"For the believer sin is not," she went on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, but faith without works is dead," said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
recalling the phrase from the catechism, and only by his smile
clinging to his independence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There you have it&#8212;from the epistle of St. James," said Alexey
Alexandrovitch, addressing Lidia Ivanovna, with a certain
reproachfulness in his tone. It was unmistakably a subject they
had discussed more than once before. "What harm has been done by
the false interpretation of that passage! Nothing holds men back
from belief like that misinterpretation. &#8216;I have not works, so I
cannot believe,&#8217; though all the while that is not said. But the
very opposite is said."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Striving for God, saving the soul by fasting," said Countess
Lidia Ivanovna, with disgusted contempt, "those are the crude
ideas of our monks.... Yet that is nowhere said. It is far
simpler and easier," she added, looking at Oblonsky with the same
encouraging smile with which at court she encouraged youthful
maids of honor, disconcerted by the new surroundings of the
court.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We are saved by Christ who suffered for us. We are saved by
faith," Alexey Alexandrovitch chimed in, with a glance of
approval at her words.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><em class="italics">"Vous comprenez l&#8217;anglais?"</em><span> asked Lidia Ivanovna, and receiving
a reply in the affirmative, she got up and began looking through
a shelf of books.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I want to read him &#8216;Safe and Happy,&#8217; or &#8216;Under the Wing,&#8217;" she
said, looking inquiringly at Karenin. And finding the book, and
sitting down again in her place, she opened it. "It&#8217;s very
short. In it is described the way by which faith can be reached,
and the happiness, above all earthly bliss, with which it fills
the soul. The believer cannot be unhappy because he is not
alone. But you will see." She was just settling herself to read
when the footman came in again. "Madame Borozdina? Tell her,
tomorrow at two o&#8217;clock. Yes," she said, putting her finger in
the place in the book, and gazing before her with her fine
pensive eyes, "that is how true faith acts. You know Marie
Sanina? You know about her trouble? She lost her only child.
She was in despair. And what happened? She found this
comforter, and she thanks God now for the death of her child.
Such is the happiness faith brings!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, yes, that is most..." said Stepan Arkadyevitch, glad they
were going to read, and let him have a chance to collect his
faculties. "No, I see I&#8217;d better not ask her about anything
today," he thought. "If only I can get out of this without
putting my foot in it!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It will be dull for you," said Countess Lidia Ivanovna,
addressing Landau; "you don&#8217;t know English, but it&#8217;s short."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, I shall understand," said Landau, with the same smile, and
he closed his eyes. Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna
exchanged meaningful glances, and the reading began.</span></p>
