<h2 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Chapter 28</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span>After the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her
husband a telegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, I must go, I must go"; she explained to her sister-in-law
the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to
remember so many things that there was no enumerating them: "no,
it had really better be today!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Stepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to
come and see his sister off at seven o&#8217;clock.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache.
Dolly and Anna dined alone with the children and the English
governess. Whether it was that the children were fickle, or that
they had acute senses, and felt that Anna was quite different
that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy
to her, that she was not now interested in them,&#8212;but they had
abruptly dropped their play with their aunt, and their love for
her, and were quite indifferent that she was going away. Anna
was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her
departure. She wrote notes to her Moscow acquaintances, put down
her accounts, and packed. Altogether Dolly fancied she was not
in a placid state of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly
knew well with herself, and which does not come without cause,
and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self. After
dinner, Anna went up to her room to dress, and Dolly followed
her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How queer you are today!" Dolly said to her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I? Do you think so? I&#8217;m not queer, but I&#8217;m nasty. I am like
that sometimes. I keep feeling as if I could cry. It&#8217;s very
stupid, but it&#8217;ll pass off," said Anna quickly, and she bent her
flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap
and some cambric handkerchiefs. Her eyes were particularly
bright, and were continually swimming with tears. "In the same
way I didn&#8217;t want to leave Petersburg, and now I don&#8217;t want to go
away from here."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You came here and did a good deed," said Dolly, looking intently
at her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Don&#8217;t say that, Dolly. I&#8217;ve done nothing, and could do nothing.
I often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me. What
have I done, and what could I do? In your heart there was found
love enough to forgive..."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened!
How happy you are, Anna!" said Dolly. "Everything is clear and
good in your heart."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Every heart has its own </span><em class="italics">skeletons</em><span>, as the English say."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You have no sort of </span><em class="italics">skeleton</em><span>, have you? Everything is so clear
in you."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have!" said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her tears,
a sly, ironical smile curved her lips.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come, he&#8217;s amusing, anyway, your </span><em class="italics">skeleton</em><span>, and not depressing,"
said Dolly, smiling.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, he&#8217;s depressing. Do you know why I&#8217;m going today instead of
tomorrow? It&#8217;s a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it
to you," said Anna, letting herself drop definitely into an
armchair, and looking straight into Dolly&#8217;s face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her
ears, up to the curly black ringlets on her neck.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes," Anna went on. "Do you know why Kitty didn&#8217;t come to
dinner? She&#8217;s jealous of me. I have spoiled ... I&#8217;ve been the
cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure.
But truly, truly, it&#8217;s not my fault, or only my fault a little
bit," she said, daintily drawling the words "a little bit."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, how like Stiva you said that!" said Dolly, laughing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Anna was hurt.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh no, oh no! I&#8217;m not Stiva," she said, knitting her brows.
"That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling you, just because I could never let
myself doubt myself for an instant," said Anna.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that
they were not true. She was not merely doubting herself, she
felt emotion at the thought of Vronsky, and was going away sooner
than she had meant, simply to avoid meeting him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that
he..."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You can&#8217;t imagine how absurdly it all came about. I only meant
to be matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite
differently. Possibly against my own will..."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She crimsoned and stopped.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, they feel it directly?" said Dolly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it
on his side," Anna interrupted her. "And I am certain it will
all be forgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I&#8217;m not very anxious
for this marriage for Kitty. And it&#8217;s better it should come to
nothing, if he, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you
in a single day."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!" said Anna, and again a
deep flush of pleasure came out on her face, when she heard the
idea, that absorbed her, put into words. "And so here I am going
away, having made an enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much! Ah,
how sweet she is! But you&#8217;ll make it right, Dolly? Eh?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile. She loved Anna, but she
enjoyed seeing that she too had her weaknesses.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"An enemy? That can&#8217;t be."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I
care for you more than ever," said Anna, with tears in her eyes.
"Ah, how silly I am today!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived, late,
rosy and good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Anna&#8217;s emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she embraced her
sister-in-law for the last time, she whispered: "Remember, Anna,
what you&#8217;ve done for me&#8212;I shall never forget. And remember
that I love you, and shall always love you as my dearest friend!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I don&#8217;t know why," said Anna, kissing her and hiding her tears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You understood me, and you understand. Good-bye, my darling!"</span></p>
