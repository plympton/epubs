<p>The visitors gave one more glance, as if to see whether Jude and Sue had left the "nots" out likewise, and then severally left the church, even the old woman at last. Sue and Jude, who had not stopped working, sent back the child to school, and remained without speaking; till, looking at her narrowly, he found she had been crying silently.</p>
<p>"Never mind, comrade!" he said. "I know what it is!"</p>
<p>"I can't <i>bear</i> that they, and everybody, should think people wicked because they may have chosen to live their own way! It is really these opinions that make the best intentioned people reckless, and actually become immoral!"</p>
<p>"Never be cast down! It was only a funny story."</p>
<p>"Ah, but we suggested it! I am afraid I have done you mischief, Jude, instead of helping you by coming!"</p>
<p>To have suggested such a story was certainly not very exhilarating, in a serious view of their position. However, in a few minutes Sue seemed to see that their position this morning had a ludicrous side, and wiping her eyes she laughed.</p>
<p>"It is droll, after all," she said, "that we two, of all people, with our queer history, should happen to be here painting the Ten Commandments! You a reprobate, and I&#8212;in my condition&#8230; O dear!" &#8230; And with her hand over her eyes she laughed again silently and intermittently, till she was quite weak.</p>
<p>"That's better," said Jude gaily. "Now we are right again, aren't we, little girl!"</p>
<p>"Oh but it is serious, all the same!" she sighed as she took up the brush and righted herself. "But do you see they don't think we are married? They <i>won't</i> believe it! It is extraordinary!"</p>
<p>"I don't care whether they think so or not," said Jude. "I shan't take any more trouble to make them."</p>
<p>They sat down to lunch&#8212;which they had brought with them not to hinder time&#8212;and having eaten it were about to set to work anew when a man entered the church, and Jude recognized in him the contractor Willis. He beckoned to Jude, and spoke to him apart.</p>
<p>"Here&#8212;I've just had a complaint about this," he said, with rather breathless awkwardness. "I don't wish to go into the matter&#8212;as of course I didn't know what was going on&#8212;but I am afraid I must ask you and her to leave off, and let somebody else finish this! It is best, to avoid all unpleasantness. I'll pay you for the week, all the same."</p>
<p>Jude was too independent to make any fuss; and the contractor paid him, and left. Jude picked up his tools, and Sue cleansed her brush. Then their eyes met.</p>
<p>"How could we be so simple as to suppose we might do this!" said she, dropping to her tragic note. "Of course we ought not&#8212;I ought not&#8212;to have come!"</p>
<p>"I had no idea that anybody was going to intrude into such a lonely place and see us!" Jude returned. "Well, it can't be helped, dear; and of course I wouldn't wish to injure Willis's trade-connection by staying." They sat down passively for a few minutes, proceeded out of the church, and overtaking the boy pursued their thoughtful way to Aldbrickham.</p>
<p>Fawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education, and, as was natural with his experiences, he was active in furthering "equality of opportunity" by any humble means open to him. He had joined an Artizans' Mutual Improvement Society established in the town about the time of his arrival there; its members being young men of all creeds and denominations, including Churchmen, Congregationalists, Baptists, Unitarians, Positivists, and others&#8212;agnostics had scarcely been heard of at this time&#8212;their one common wish to enlarge their minds forming a sufficiently close bond of union. The subscription was small, and the room homely; and Jude's activity, uncustomary acquirements, and above all, singular intuition on what to read and how to set about it&#8212;begotten of his years of struggle against malignant stars&#8212;had led to his being placed on the committee.</p>
<p>A few evenings after his dismissal from the church repairs, and before he had obtained any more work to do, he went to attend a meeting of the aforesaid committee. It was late when he arrived: all the others had come, and as he entered they looked dubiously at him, and hardly uttered a word of greeting. He guessed that something bearing on himself had been either discussed or mooted. Some ordinary business was transacted, and it was disclosed that the number of subscriptions had shown a sudden falling off for that quarter. One member&#8212;a really well-meaning and upright man&#8212;began speaking in enigmas about certain possible causes: that it behoved them to look well into their constitution; for if the committee were not respected, and had not at least, in their differences, a common standard of <i>conduct</i>, they would bring the institution to the ground. Nothing further was said in Jude's presence, but he knew what this meant; and turning to the table wrote a note resigning his office there and then.</p>
<p>Thus the supersensitive couple were more and more impelled to go away. And then bills were sent in, and the question arose, what could Jude do with his great-aunt's heavy old furniture, if he left the town to travel he knew not whither? This, and the necessity of ready money, compelled him to decide on an auction, much as he would have preferred to keep the venerable goods.</p>
<p>The day of the sale came on; and Sue for the last time cooked her own, the child's, and Jude's breakfast in the little house he had furnished. It chanced to be a wet day; moreover Sue was unwell, and not wishing to desert her poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances, for he was compelled to stay awhile, she acted on the suggestion of the auctioneer's man, and ensconced herself in an upper room, which could be emptied of its effects, and so kept closed to the bidders. Here Jude discovered her; and with the child, and their few trunks, baskets, and bundles, and two chairs and a table that were not in the sale, the two sat in meditative talk.</p>
<p>Footsteps began stamping up and down the bare stairs, the comers inspecting the goods, some of which were of so quaint and ancient a make as to acquire an adventitious value as art. Their door was tried once or twice, and to guard themselves against intrusion Jude wrote "Private" on a scrap of paper, and stuck it upon the panel.</p>
<p>They soon found that, instead of the furniture, their own personal histories and past conduct began to be discussed to an unexpected and intolerable extent by the intending bidders. It was not till now that they really discovered what a fools' paradise of supposed unrecognition they had been living in of late. Sue silently took her companion's hand, and with eyes on each other they heard these passing remarks&#8212;the quaint and mysterious personality of Father Time being a subject which formed a large ingredient in the hints and innuendoes. At length the auction began in the room below, whence they could hear each familiar article knocked down, the highly prized ones cheaply, the unconsidered at an unexpected price.</p>
<p>"People don't understand us," he sighed heavily. "I am glad we have decided to go."</p>
<p>"The question is, where to?"</p>
<p>"It ought to be to London. There one can live as one chooses."</p>
<p>"No&#8212;not London, dear! I know it well. We should be unhappy there."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Can't you think?"</p>
<p>"Because Arabella is there?"</p>
<p>"That's the chief reason."</p>
<p>"But in the country I shall always be uneasy lest there should be some more of our late experience. And I don't care to lessen it by explaining, for one thing, all about the boy's history. To cut him off from his past I have determined to keep silence. I am sickened of ecclesiastical work now; and I shouldn't like to accept it, if offered me!"</p>
<p>"You ought to have learnt classic. Gothic is barbaric art, after all. Pugin was wrong, and Wren was right. Remember the interior of Christminster Cathedral&#8212;almost the first place in which we looked in each other's faces. Under the picturesqueness of those Norman details one can see the grotesque childishness of uncouth people trying to imitate the vanished Roman forms, remembered by dim tradition only."</p>
<p>"Yes&#8212;you have half-converted me to that view by what you have said before. But one can work, and despise what one does. I must do something, if not church-gothic."</p>
<p>"I wish we could both follow an occupation in which personal circumstances don't count," she said, smiling up wistfully. "I am as disqualified for teaching as you are for ecclesiastical art. You must fall back upon railway stations, bridges, theatres, music-halls, hotels&#8212;everything that has no connection with conduct."</p>
<p>"I am not skilled in those&#8230; I ought to take to bread-baking. I grew up in the baking business with aunt, you know. But even a baker must be conventional, to get customers."</p>
<p>"Unless he keeps a cake and gingerbread stall at markets and fairs, where people are gloriously indifferent to everything except the quality of the goods."</p>
<p>Their thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer: "Now this antique oak settle&#8212;a unique example of old English furniture, worthy the attention of all collectors!"</p>
<p>"That was my great-grandfather's," said Jude. "I wish we could have kept the poor old thing!"</p>
<p>One by one the articles went, and the afternoon passed away. Jude and the other two were getting tired and hungry, but after the conversation they had heard they were shy of going out while the purchasers were in their line of retreat. However, the later lots drew on, and it became necessary to emerge into the rain soon, to take on Sue's things to their temporary lodging.</p>
<p>"Now the next lot: two pairs of pigeons, all alive and plump&#8212;a nice pie for somebody for next Sunday's dinner!"</p>
<p>The impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense of the whole afternoon. They were Sue's pets, and when it was found that they could not possibly be kept, more sadness was caused than by parting from all the furniture. Sue tried to think away her tears as she heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth advanced by small stages to the price at which they were finally knocked down. The purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer, and they were unquestionably doomed to die before the next market day.</p>
<p>Noting her dissembled distress Jude kissed her, and said it was time to go and see if the lodgings were ready. He would go on with the boy, and fetch her soon.</p>
<p>When she was left alone she waited patiently, but Jude did not come back. At last she started, the coast being clear, and on passing the poulterer's shop, not far off, she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the door. An emotion at sight of them, assisted by the growing dusk of evening, caused her to act on impulse, and first looking around her quickly, she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover, and went on. The cover was lifted from within, and the pigeons flew away with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and swearing to the door.</p>
<p>Sue reached the lodging trembling, and found Jude and the boy making it comfortable for her. "Do the buyers pay before they bring away the things?" she asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Yes, I think. Why?"</p>
<p>"Because, then, I've done such a wicked thing!" And she explained, in bitter contrition.</p>
<p>"I shall have to pay the poulterer for them, if he doesn't catch them," said Jude. "But never mind. Don't fret about it, dear."</p>
<p>"It was so foolish of me! Oh why should Nature's law be mutual butchery!"</p>
<p>"Is it so, Mother?" asked the boy intently.</p>
<p>"Yes!" said Sue vehemently.</p>
<p>"Well, they must take their chance, now, poor things," said Jude. "As soon as the sale-account is wound up, and our bills paid, we go."</p>
<p>"Where do we go to?" asked Time, in suspense.</p>
<p>"We must sail under sealed orders, that nobody may trace us&#8230; We mustn't go to Alfredston, or to Melchester, or to Shaston, or to Christminster. Apart from those we may go anywhere."</p>
<p>"Why mustn't we go there, Father?"</p>
<p>"Because of a cloud that has gathered over us; though 'we have wronged no man, corrupted no man, defrauded no man!' Though perhaps we have 'done that which was right in our own eyes.'"</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00054">VII</h2>
<p>From that week Jude Fawley and Sue walked no more in the town of Aldbrickham.</p>
<p>Whither they had gone nobody knew, chiefly because nobody cared to know. Any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such an obscure pair might have discovered without great trouble that they had taken advantage of his adaptive craftsmanship to enter on a shifting, almost nomadic, life, which was not without its pleasantness for a time.</p>
<p>Wherever Jude heard of free-stone work to be done, thither he went, choosing by preference places remote from his old haunts and Sue's. He laboured at a job, long or briefly, till it was finished; and then moved on.</p>
<p>Two whole years and a half passed thus. Sometimes he might have been found shaping the mullions of a country mansion, sometimes setting the parapet of a town-hall, sometimes ashlaring an hotel at Sandbourne, sometimes a museum at Casterbridge, sometimes as far down as Exonbury, sometimes at Stoke-Barehills. Later still he was at Kennetbridge, a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of Marygreen, this being his nearest approach to the village where he was known; for he had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his life and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him during his ardent young manhood of study and promise, and his brief and unhappy married life at that time.</p>
<p>At some of these places he would be detained for months, at others only a few weeks. His curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical work, both episcopal and noncomformist, which had risen in him when suffering under a smarting sense of misconception, remained with him in cold blood, less from any fear of renewed censure than from an ultra-conscientiousness which would not allow him to seek a living out of those who would disapprove of his ways; also, too, from a sense of inconsistency between his former dogmas and his present practice, hardly a shred of the beliefs with which he had first gone up to Christminster now remaining with him. He was mentally approaching the position which Sue had occupied when he first met her.</p>
<p>On a Saturday evening in May, nearly three years after Arabella's recognition of Sue and himself at the agricultural show, some of those who there encountered each other met again.</p>
<p>It was the spring fair at Kennetbridge, and, though this ancient trade-meeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times, the long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene about midday. At this hour a light trap, among other vehicles, was driven into the town by the north road, and up to the door of a temperance inn. There alighted two women, one the driver, an ordinary country person, the other a finely built figure in the deep mourning of a widow. Her sombre suit, of pronounced cut, caused her to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a provincial fair.</p>
<p>"I will just find out where it is, Anny," said the widow-lady to her companion, when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came forward: "and then I'll come back, and meet you here; and we'll go in and have something to eat and drink. I begin to feel quite a sinking."</p>
<p>"With all my heart," said the other. "Though I would sooner have put up at the Chequers or The Jack. You can't get much at these temperance houses."</p>
<p>"Now, don't you give way to gluttonous desires, my child," said the woman in weeds reprovingly. "This is the proper place. Very well: we'll meet in half an hour, unless you come with me to find out where the site of the new chapel is?"</p>
<p>"I don't care to. You can tell me."</p>
<p>The companions then went their several ways, the one in crape walking firmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous surroundings. Making inquiries she came to a hoarding, within which were excavations denoting the foundations of a building; and on the boards without one or two large posters announcing that the foundation-stone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that afternoon at three o'clock by a London preacher of great popularity among his body.</p>
<p>Having ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her steps, and gave herself leisure to observe the movements of the fair. By and by her attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and ginger-breads, standing between the more pretentious erections of trestles and canvas. It was covered with an immaculate cloth, and tended by a young woman apparently unused to the business, she being accompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face, who assisted her.</p>
<p>"Upon my&#8212;senses!" murmured the widow to herself. "His wife Sue&#8212;if she is so!" She drew nearer to the stall. "How do you do, Mrs. Fawley?" she said blandly.</p>
<p>Sue changed colour and recognized Arabella through the crape veil.</p>
<p>"How are you, Mrs. Cartlett?" she said stiffly. And then perceiving Arabella's garb her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself. "What?&#8212;you have lost&#8212;"</p>
<p>"My poor husband. Yes. He died suddenly, six weeks ago, leaving me none too well off, though he was a kind husband to me. But whatever profit there is in public-house keeping goes to them that brew the liquors, and not to them that retail 'em&#8230; And you, my little old man! You don't know me, I expect?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. You be the woman I thought wer my mother for a bit, till I found you wasn't," replied Father Time, who had learned to use the Wessex tongue quite naturally by now.</p>
<p>"All right. Never mind. I am a friend."</p>
<p>"Juey," said Sue suddenly, "go down to the station platform with this tray&#8212;there's another train coming in, I think."</p>
<p>When he was gone Arabella continued: "He'll never be a beauty, will he, poor chap! Does he know I am his mother really?"</p>
<p>"No. He thinks there is some mystery about his parentage&#8212;that's all. Jude is going to tell him when he is a little older."</p>
<p>"But how do you come to be doing this? I am surprised."</p>
<p>"It is only a temporary occupation&#8212;a fancy of ours while we are in a difficulty."</p>
<p>"Then you are living with him still?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Married?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Any children?"</p>
<p>"Two."</p>
<p>"And another coming soon, I see."</p>
<p>Sue writhed under the hard and direct questioning, and her tender little mouth began to quiver.</p>
<p>"Lord&#8212;I mean goodness gracious&#8212;what is there to cry about? Some folks would be proud enough!"</p>
<p>"It is not that I am ashamed&#8212;not as you think! But it seems such a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world&#8212;so presumptuous&#8212;that I question my right to do it sometimes!"</p>
<p>"Take it easy, my dear&#8230; But you don't tell me why you do such a thing as this? Jude used to be a proud sort of chap&#8212;above any business almost, leave alone keeping a standing."</p>
<p>"Perhaps my husband has altered a little since then. I am sure he is not proud now!" And Sue's lips quivered again. "I am doing this because he caught a chill early in the year while putting up some stonework of a music-hall, at Quartershot, which he had to do in the rain, the work having to be executed by a fixed day. He is better than he was; but it has been a long, weary time! We have had an old widow friend with us to help us through it; but she's leaving soon."</p>
<p>"Well, I am respectable too, thank God, and of a serious way of thinking since my loss. Why did you choose to sell gingerbreads?"</p>
<p>"That's a pure accident. He was brought up to the baking business, and it occurred to him to try his hand at these, which he can make without coming out of doors. We call them Christminster cakes. They are a great success."</p>
<p>"I never saw any like 'em. Why, they are windows and towers, and pinnacles! And upon my word they are very nice." She had helped herself, and was unceremoniously munching one of the cakes.</p>
<p>"Yes. They are reminiscences of the Christminster Colleges. Traceried windows, and cloisters, you see. It was a whim of his to do them in pastry."</p>
<p>"Still harping on Christminster&#8212;even in his cakes!" laughed Arabella. "Just like Jude. A ruling passion. What a queer fellow he is, and always will be!"</p>
<p>Sue sighed, and she looked her distress at hearing him criticized.</p>
<p>"Don't you think he is? Come now; you do, though you are so fond of him!"</p>
<p>"Of course Christminster is a sort of fixed vision with him, which I suppose he'll never be cured of believing in. He still thinks it a great centre of high and fearless thought, instead of what it is, a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid obsequiousness to tradition."</p>
<p>Arabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she was speaking than of what she was saying. "How odd to hear a woman selling cakes talk like that!" she said. "Why don't you go back to school-keeping?"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "They won't have me."</p>
<p>"Because of the divorce, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"That and other things. And there is no reason to wish it. We gave up all ambition, and were never so happy in our lives till his illness came."</p>
<p>"Where are you living?"</p>
<p>"I don't care to say."</p>
<p>"Here in Kennetbridge?"</p>
<p>Sue's manner showed Arabella that her random guess was right.</p>
<p>"Here comes the boy back again," continued Arabella. "My boy and Jude's!"</p>
<p>Sue's eyes darted a spark. "You needn't throw that in my face!" she cried.</p>
<p>"Very well&#8212;though I half-feel as if I should like to have him with me! &#8230; But Lord, I don't want to take him from 'ee&#8212;ever I should sin to speak so profane&#8212;though I should think you must have enough of your own! He's in very good hands, that I know; and I am not the woman to find fault with what the Lord has ordained. I've reached a more resigned frame of mind."</p>
<p>"Indeed! I wish I had been able to do so."</p>
<p>"You should try," replied the widow, from the serene heights of a soul conscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority. "I make no boast of my awakening, but I'm not what I was. After Cartlett's death I was passing the chapel in the street next ours, and went into it for shelter from a shower of rain. I felt a need of some sort of support under my loss, and, as 'twas righter than gin, I took to going there regular, and found it a great comfort. But I've left London now, you know, and at present I am living at Alfredston, with my friend Anny, to be near my own old country. I'm not come here to the fair to-day. There's to be the foundation-stone of a new chapel laid this afternoon by a popular London preacher, and I drove over with Anny. Now I must go back to meet her."</p>
<p>Then Arabella wished Sue good-bye, and went on.</p>
<p>&#160;<a id="id_5-8"></a><br/>
&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00055">VIII</h2>
<p>In the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge fair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down the street. Those who peeped through the opening saw a crowd of persons in broadcloth, with hymn-books in their hands, standing round the excavations for the new chapel-walls. Arabella Cartlett and her weeds stood among them. She had a clear, powerful voice, which could be distinctly heard with the rest, rising and falling to the tune, her inflated bosom being also seen doing likewise.</p>
<p>It was two hours later on the same day that Anny and Mrs. Cartlett, having had tea at the Temperance Hotel, started on their return journey across the high and open country which stretches between Kennetbridge and Alfredston. Arabella was in a thoughtful mood; but her thoughts were not of the new chapel, as Anny at first surmised.</p>
<p>"No&#8212;it is something else," at last said Arabella sullenly. "I came here to-day never thinking of anybody but poor Cartlett, or of anything but spreading the Gospel by means of this new tabernacle they've begun this afternoon. But something has happened to turn my mind another way quite. Anny, I've heard of un again, and I've seen <i>her</i>!"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"I've heard of Jude, and I've seen his wife. And ever since, do what I will, and though I sung the hymns wi' all my strength, I have not been able to help thinking about 'n; which I've no right to do as a chapel member."</p>
<p>"Can't ye fix your mind upon what was said by the London preacher to-day, and try to get rid of your wandering fancies that way?"</p>
<p>"I do. But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself!"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;I know what it is to have a wanton mind o' my own, too! If you on'y knew what I do dream sometimes o' nights quite against my wishes, you'd say I had my struggles!" (Anny, too, had grown rather serious of late, her lover having jilted her.)</p>
<p>"What shall I do about it?" urged Arabella morbidly.</p>
<p>"You could take a lock of your late-lost husband's hair, and have it made into a mourning brooch, and look at it every hour of the day."</p>
<p>"I haven't a morsel!&#8212;and if I had 'twould be no good&#8230; After all that's said about the comforts of this religion, I wish I had Jude back again!"</p>
<p>"You must fight valiant against the feeling, since he's another's. And I've heard that another good thing for it, when it afflicts volupshious widows, is to go to your husband's grave in the dusk of evening, and stand a long while a-bowed down."</p>
<p>"Pooh! I know as well as you what I should do; only I don't do it!"</p>
<p>They drove in silence along the straight road till they were within the horizon of Marygreen, which lay not far to the left of their route. They came to the junction of the highway and the cross-lane leading to that village, whose church-tower could be seen athwart the hollow. When they got yet farther on, and were passing the lonely house in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of their marriage, and where the pig-killing had taken place, she could control herself no longer.</p>
<p>"He's more mine than hers!" she burst out. "What right has she to him, I should like to know! I'd take him from her if I could!"</p>
<p>"Fie, Abby! And your husband only six weeks gone! Pray against it!"</p>
<p>"Be damned if I do! Feelings are feelings! I won't be a creeping hypocrite any longer&#8212;so there!"</p>
<p>Arabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which she had brought with her to distribute at the fair, and of which she had given away several. As she spoke she flung the whole remainder of the packet into the hedge. "I've tried that sort o' physic and have failed wi' it. I must be as I was born!"</p>
<p>"Hush! You be excited, dear! Now you come along home quiet, and have a cup of tea, and don't let us talk about un no more. We won't come out this road again, as it leads to where he is, because it inflames 'ee so. You'll be all right again soon."</p>
<p>Arabella did calm herself down by degrees; and they crossed the ridge-way. When they began to descend the long, straight hill, they saw plodding along in front of them an elderly man of spare stature and thoughtful gait. In his hand he carried a basket; and there was a touch of slovenliness in his attire, together with that indefinable something in his whole appearance which suggested one who was his own housekeeper, purveyor, confidant, and friend, through possessing nobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him. The remainder of the journey was down-hill, and guessing him to be going to Alfredston they offered him a lift, which he accepted.</p>
<p>Arabella looked at him, and looked again, till at length she spoke. "If I don't mistake I am talking to Mr. Phillotson?"</p>
<p>The wayfarer faced round and regarded her in turn. "Yes; my name is Phillotson," he said. "But I don't recognize you, ma'am."</p>
<p>"I remember you well enough when you used to be schoolmaster out at Marygreen, and I one of your scholars. I used to walk up there from Cresscombe every day, because we had only a mistress down at our place, and you taught better. But you wouldn't remember me as I should you?&#8212;Arabella Donn."</p>
<p>He shook his head. "No," he said politely, "I don't recall the name. And I should hardly recognize in your present portly self the slim school child no doubt you were then."</p>
<p>"Well, I always had plenty of flesh on my bones. However, I am staying down here with some friends at present. You know, I suppose, who I married?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Jude Fawley&#8212;also a scholar of yours&#8212;at least a night scholar&#8212;for some little time I think? And known to you afterwards, if I am not mistaken."</p>
<p>"Dear me, dear me," said Phillotson, starting out of his stiffness. "<i>You</i> Fawley's wife? To be sure&#8212;he had a wife! And he&#8212;I understood&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Divorced her&#8212;as you did yours&#8212;perhaps for better reasons."</p>
<p>"Indeed?"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;he med have been right in doing it&#8212;right for both; for I soon married again, and all went pretty straight till my husband died lately. But you&#8212;you were decidedly wrong!"</p>
<p>"No," said Phillotson, with sudden testiness. "I would rather not talk of this, but&#8212;I am convinced I did only what was right, and just, and moral. I have suffered for my act and opinions, but I hold to them; though her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one!"</p>
<p>"You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?"</p>
<p>"I don't care to talk of it. I have recently come back here&#8212;to Marygreen. I mean."</p>
<p>"You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?"</p>
<p>The pressure of a sadness that would out unsealed him. "I am there," he replied. "Just as formerly, no. Merely on sufferance. It was a last resource&#8212;a small thing to return to after my move upwards, and my long indulged hopes&#8212;a returning to zero, with all its humiliations. But it is a refuge. I like the seclusion of the place, and the vicar having known me before my so-called eccentric conduct towards my wife had ruined my reputation as a schoolmaster, he accepted my services when all other schools were closed against me. However, although I take fifty pounds a year here after taking above two hundred elsewhere, I prefer it to running the risk of having my old domestic experiences raked up against me, as I should do if I tried to make a move."</p>
<p>"Right you are. A contented mind is a continual feast. She has done no better."</p>
<p>"She is not doing well, you mean?"</p>
<p>"I met her by accident at Kennetbridge this very day, and she is anything but thriving. Her husband is ill, and she anxious. You made a fool of a mistake about her, I tell 'ee again, and the harm you did yourself by dirting your own nest serves you right, excusing the liberty."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"She was innocent."</p>
<p>"But nonsense! They did not even defend the case!"</p>
<p>"That was because they didn't care to. She was quite innocent of what obtained you your freedom, at the time you obtained it. I saw her just afterwards, and proved it to myself completely by talking to her."</p>
<p>Phillotson grasped the edge of the spring-cart, and appeared to be much stressed and worried by the information. "Still&#8212;she wanted to go," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes. But you shouldn't have let her. That's the only way with these fanciful women that chaw high&#8212;innocent or guilty. She'd have come round in time. We all do! Custom does it! It's all the same in the end! However, I think she's fond of her man still&#8212;whatever he med be of her. You were too quick about her. <i>I</i> shouldn't have let her go! I should have kept her chained on&#8212;her spirit for kicking would have been broke soon enough! There's nothing like bondage and a stone-deaf taskmaster for taming us women. Besides, you've got the laws on your side. Moses knew. Don't you call to mind what he says?"</p>
<p>"Not for the moment, ma'am, I regret to say."</p>
<p>"Call yourself a schoolmaster! I used to think o't when they read it in church, and I was carrying on a bit. 'Then shall the man be guiltless; but the woman shall bear her iniquity.' Damn rough on us women; but we must grin and put up wi' it! Haw haw! Well; she's got her deserts now."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Phillotson, with biting sadness. "Cruelty is the law pervading all nature and society; and we can't get out of it if we would!"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;don't you forget to try it next time, old man."</p>
<p>"I cannot answer you, madam. I have never known much of womankind."</p>
<p>They had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston, and passing through the outskirts approached a mill, to which Phillotson said his errand led him; whereupon they drew up, and he alighted, bidding them good-night in a preoccupied mood.</p>
<p>In the meantime Sue, though remarkably successful in her cake-selling experiment at Kennetbridge fair, had lost the temporary brightness which had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success. When all her "Christminster" cakes had been disposed of she took upon her arm the empty basket, and the cloth which had covered the standing she had hired, and giving the other things to the boy left the street with him. They followed a lane to a distance of half a mile, till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes, and leading a toddler in the other hand.</p>
<p>Sue kissed the children, and said, "How is he now?"</p>
<p>"Still better!" returned Mrs. Edlin cheerfully. "Before you are upstairs again your husband will be well enough&#8212;don't 'ee trouble."</p>
<p>They turned, and came to some old, dun-tiled cottages with gardens and fruit-trees. Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch without knocking, and were at once in the general living-room. Here they greeted Jude, who was sitting in an arm-chair, the increased delicacy of his normally delicate features, and the childishly expectant look in his eyes, being alone sufficient to show that he had been passing through a severe illness.</p>
<p>"What&#8212;you have sold them all?" he said, a gleam of interest lighting up his face.</p>
<p>"Yes. Arcades, gables, east windows and all." She told him the pecuniary results, and then hesitated. At last, when they were left alone, she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella, and the latter's widowhood.</p>
<p>Jude was discomposed. "What&#8212;is she living here?" he said.</p>
<p>"No; at Alfredston," said Sue.</p>
<p>Jude's countenance remained clouded. "I thought I had better tell you?" she continued, kissing him anxiously.</p>
<p>"Yes&#8230; Dear me! Arabella not in the depths of London, but down here! It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to Alfredston. What is she doing there?"</p>
<p>She told him all she knew. "She has taken to chapel-going," Sue added; "and talks accordingly."</p>
<p>"Well," said Jude, "perhaps it is for the best that we have almost decided to move on. I feel much better to-day, and shall be well enough to leave in a week or two. Then Mrs. Edlin can go home again&#8212;dear faithful old soul&#8212;the only friend we have in the world!"</p>
<p>"Where do you think to go to?" Sue asked, a troublousness in her tones.</p>
<p>Then Jude confessed what was in his mind. He said it would surprise her, perhaps, after his having resolutely avoided all the old places for so long. But one thing and another had made him think a great deal of Christminster lately, and, if she didn't mind, he would like to go back there. Why should they care if they were known? It was oversensitive of them to mind so much. They could go on selling cakes there, for that matter, if he couldn't work. He had no sense of shame at mere poverty; and perhaps he would be as strong as ever soon, and able to set up stone-cutting for himself there.</p>
<p>"Why should you care so much for Christminster?" she said pensively. "Christminster cares nothing for you, poor dear!"</p>
<p>"Well, I do, I can't help it. I love the place&#8212;although I know how it hates all men like me&#8212;the so-called self-taught&#8212;how it scorns our laboured acquisitions, when it should be the first to respect them; how it sneers at our false quantities and mispronunciations, when it should say, I see you want help, my poor friend! &#8230; Nevertheless, it is the centre of the universe to me, because of my early dream: and nothing can alter it. Perhaps it will soon wake up, and be generous. I pray so! &#8230; I should like to go back to live there&#8212;perhaps to die there! In two or three weeks I might, I think. It will then be June, and I should like to be there by a particular day."</p>
<p>His hope that he was recovering proved so far well grounded that in three weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories; were actually treading its pavements, receiving the reflection of the sunshine from its wasting walls.</p>

<p>On their arrival the station was lively with straw-hatted young men, welcoming young girls who bore a remarkable family likeness to their welcomers, and who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of raiment.</p>
<p>"The place seems gay," said Sue. "Why&#8212;it is Remembrance Day!&#8212;Jude&#8212;how sly of you&#8212;you came to-day on purpose!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Jude quietly, as he took charge of the small child, and told Arabella's boy to keep close to them, Sue attending to their own eldest. "I thought we might as well come to-day as on any other."</p>
<p>"But I am afraid it will depress you!" she said, looking anxiously at him up and down.</p>
<p>"Oh, I mustn't let it interfere with our business; and we have a good deal to do before we shall be settled here. The first thing is lodgings."</p>
<p>Having left their luggage and his tools at the station they proceeded on foot up the familiar street, the holiday people all drifting in the same direction. Reaching the Fourways they were about to turn off to where accommodation was likely to be found when, looking at the clock and the hurrying crowd, Jude said: "Let us go and see the procession, and never mind the lodgings just now? We can get them afterwards."</p>
<p>"Oughtn't we to get a house over our heads first?" she asked.</p>
<p>But his soul seemed full of the anniversary, and together they went down Chief Street, their smallest child in Jude's arms, Sue leading her little girl, and Arabella's boy walking thoughtfully and silently beside them. Crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes, and meekly ignorant parents who had known no college in their youth, were under convoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion written large on them that no properly qualified human beings had lived on earth till they came to grace it here and now.</p>
<p>"My failure is reflected on me by every one of those young fellows," said Jude. "A lesson on presumption is awaiting me to-day!&#8212;Humiliation Day for me! &#8230; If you, my dear darling, hadn't come to my rescue, I should have gone to the dogs with despair!"</p>
<p>She saw from his face that he was getting into one of his tempestuous, self-harrowing moods. "It would have been better if we had gone at once about our own affairs, dear," she answered. "I am sure this sight will awaken old sorrows in you, and do no good!"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;we are near; we will see it now," said he.</p>
<p>They turned in on the left by the church with the Italian porch, whose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers, and pursued the lane till there arose on Jude's sight the circular theatre with that well-known lantern above it, which stood in his mind as the sad symbol of his abandoned hopes, for it was from that outlook that he had finally surveyed the City of Colleges on the afternoon of his great meditation, which convinced him at last of the futility of his attempt to be a son of the university.</p>
<p>To-day, in the open space stretching between this building and the nearest college, stood a crowd of expectant people. A passage was kept clear through their midst by two barriers of timber, extending from the door of the college to the door of the large building between it and the theatre.</p>
<p>"Here is the place&#8212;they are just going to pass!" cried Jude in sudden excitement. And pushing his way to the front he took up a position close to the barrier, still hugging the youngest child in his arms, while Sue and the others kept immediately behind him. The crowd filled in at their back, and fell to talking, joking, and laughing as carriage after carriage drew up at the lower door of the college, and solemn stately figures in blood-red robes began to alight. The sky had grown overcast and livid, and thunder rumbled now and then.</p>
<p>Father Time shuddered. "It do seem like the Judgment Day!" he whispered.</p>
<p>"They are only learned doctors," said Sue.</p>
<p>While they waited big drops of rain fell on their heads and shoulders, and the delay grew tedious. Sue again wished not to stay.</p>
<p>"They won't be long now," said Jude, without turning his head.</p>
<p>But the procession did not come forth, and somebody in the crowd, to pass the time, looked at the fa&#231;ade of the nearest college, and said he wondered what was meant by the Latin inscription in its midst. Jude, who stood near the inquirer, explained it, and finding that the people all round him were listening with interest, went on to describe the carving of the frieze (which he had studied years before), and to criticize some details of masonry in other college fronts about the city.</p>
<p>The idle crowd, including the two policemen at the doors, stared like the Lycaonians at Paul, for Jude was apt to get too enthusiastic over any subject in hand, and they seemed to wonder how the stranger should know more about the buildings of their town than they themselves did; till one of them said: "Why, I know that man; he used to work here years ago&#8212;Jude Fawley, that's his name! Don't you mind he used to be nicknamed Tutor of St. Slums, d'ye mind?&#8212;because he aimed at that line o' business? He's married, I suppose, then, and that's his child he's carrying. Taylor would know him, as he knows everybody."</p>
<p>The speaker was a man named Jack Stagg, with whom Jude had formerly worked in repairing the college masonries; Tinker Taylor was seen to be standing near. Having his attention called the latter cried across the barriers to Jude: "You've honoured us by coming back again, my friend!"</p>
<p>Jude nodded.</p>
<p>"An' you don't seem to have done any great things for yourself by going away?"</p>
<p>Jude assented to this also.</p>
<p>"Except found more mouths to fill!" This came in a new voice, and Jude recognized its owner to be Uncle Joe, another mason whom he had known.</p>
<p>Jude replied good-humouredly that he could not dispute it; and from remark to remark something like a general conversation arose between him and the crowd of idlers, during which Tinker Taylor asked Jude if he remembered the Apostles' Creed in Latin still, and the night of the challenge in the public house.</p>
<p>"But Fortune didn't lie that way?" threw in Joe. "Yer powers wasn't enough to carry 'ee through?"</p>
<p>"Don't answer them any more!" entreated Sue.</p>
<p>"I don't think I like Christminster!" murmured little Time mournfully, as he stood submerged and invisible in the crowd.</p>
<p>But finding himself the centre of curiosity, quizzing, and comment, Jude was not inclined to shrink from open declarations of what he had no great reason to be ashamed of; and in a little while was stimulated to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally:</p>
<p>"It is a difficult question, my friends, for any young man&#8212;that question I had to grapple with, and which thousands are weighing at the present moment in these uprising times&#8212;whether to follow uncritically the track he finds himself in, without considering his aptness for it, or to consider what his aptness or bent may be, and re-shape his course accordingly. I tried to do the latter, and I failed. But I don't admit that my failure proved my view to be a wrong one, or that my success would have made it a right one; though that's how we appraise such attempts nowadays&#8212;I mean, not by their essential soundness, but by their accidental outcomes. If I had ended by becoming like one of these gentlemen in red and black that we saw dropping in here by now, everybody would have said: 'See how wise that young man was, to follow the bent of his nature!' But having ended no better than I began they say: 'See what a fool that fellow was in following a freak of his fancy!'</p>
<p>"However it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be beaten. It takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do in one; and my impulses&#8212;affections&#8212;vices perhaps they should be called&#8212;were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages; who should be as cold-blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a really good chance of being one of his country's worthies. You may ridicule me&#8212;I am quite willing that you should&#8212;I am a fit subject, no doubt. But I think if you knew what I have gone through these last few years you would rather pity me. And if they knew"&#8212;he nodded towards the college at which the dons were severally arriving&#8212;"it is just possible they would do the same."</p>
<p>"He do look ill and worn-out, it is true!" said a woman.</p>
<p>Sue's face grew more emotional; but though she stood close to Jude she was screened.</p>
<p>"I may do some good before I am dead&#8212;be a sort of success as a frightful example of what not to do; and so illustrate a moral story," continued Jude, beginning to grow bitter, though he had opened serenely enough. "I was, perhaps, after all, a paltry victim to the spirit of mental and social restlessness that makes so many unhappy in these days!"</p>
<p>"Don't tell them that!" whispered Sue with tears, at perceiving Jude's state of mind. "You weren't that. You struggled nobly to acquire knowledge, and only the meanest souls in the world would blame you!"</p>
<p>Jude shifted the child into a more easy position on his arm, and concluded: "And what I appear, a sick and poor man, is not the worst of me. I am in a chaos of principles&#8212;groping in the dark&#8212;acting by instinct and not after example. Eight or nine years ago when I came here first, I had a neat stock of fixed opinions, but they dropped away one by one; and the further I get the less sure I am. I doubt if I have anything more for my present rule of life than following inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm, and actually give pleasure to those I love best. There, gentlemen, since you wanted to know how I was getting on, I have told you. Much good may it do you! I cannot explain further here. I perceive there is something wrong somewhere in our social formulas: what it is can only be discovered by men or women with greater insight than mine&#8212;if, indeed, they ever discover it&#8212;at least in our time. 'For who knoweth what is good for man in this life?&#8212;and who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?'"</p>
<p>"Hear, hear," said the populace.</p>
<p>"Well preached!" said Tinker Taylor. And privately to his neighbours: "Why, one of them jobbing pa'sons swarming about here, that takes the services when our head reverends want a holiday, wouldn't ha' discoursed such doctrine for less than a guinea down? Hey? I'll take my oath not one o' 'em would! And then he must have had it wrote down for 'n. And this only a working-man!"</p>
<p>As a sort of objective commentary on Jude's remarks there drove up at this moment with a belated doctor, robed and panting, a cab whose horse failed to stop at the exact point required for setting down the hirer, who jumped out and entered the door. The driver, alighting, began to kick the animal in the belly.</p>
<p>"If that can be done," said Jude, "at college gates in the most religious and educational city in the world, what shall we say as to how far we've got?"</p>
<p>"Order!" said one of the policemen, who had been engaged with a comrade in opening the large doors opposite the college. "Keep yer tongue quiet, my man, while the procession passes." The rain came on more heavily, and all who had umbrellas opened them. Jude was not one of these, and Sue only possessed a small one, half sunshade. She had grown pale, though Jude did not notice it then.</p>
<p>"Let us go on, dear," she whispered, endeavouring to shelter him. "We haven't any lodgings yet, remember, and all our things are at the station; and you are by no means well yet. I am afraid this wet will hurt you!"</p>
<p>"They are coming now. Just a moment, and I'll go!" said he.</p>
<p>A peal of six bells struck out, human faces began to crowd the windows around, and the procession of heads of houses and new doctors emerged, their red and black gowned forms passing across the field of Jude's vision like inaccessible planets across an object glass.</p>
<p>As they went their names were called by knowing informants, and when they reached the old round theatre of Wren a cheer rose high.</p>
<p>"Let's go that way!" cried Jude, and though it now rained steadily he seemed not to know it, and took them round to the theatre. Here they stood upon the straw that was laid to drown the discordant noise of wheels, where the quaint and frost-eaten stone busts encircling the building looked with pallid grimness on the proceedings, and in particular at the bedraggled Jude, Sue, and their children, as at ludicrous persons who had no business there.</p>
<p>"I wish I could get in!" he said to her fervidly. "Listen&#8212;I may catch a few words of the Latin speech by staying here; the windows are open."</p>
<p>However, beyond the peals of the organ, and the shouts and hurrahs between each piece of oratory, Jude's standing in the wet did not bring much Latin to his intelligence more than, now and then, a sonorous word in <i>um</i> or <i>ibus</i>.</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;I'm an outsider to the end of my days!" he sighed after a while. "Now I'll go, my patient Sue. How good of you to wait in the rain all this time&#8212;to gratify my infatuation! I'll never care any more about the infernal cursed place, upon my soul I won't! But what made you tremble so when we were at the barrier? And how pale you are, Sue!"</p>
<p>"I saw Richard amongst the people on the other side."</p>
<p>"Ah&#8212;did you!"</p>
<p>"He is evidently come up to Jerusalem to see the festival like the rest of us: and on that account is probably living not so very far away. He had the same hankering for the university that you had, in a milder form. I don't think he saw me, though he must have heard you speaking to the crowd. But he seemed not to notice."</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;suppose he did. Your mind is free from worries about him now, my Sue?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose so. But I am weak. Although I know it is all right with our plans, I felt a curious dread of him; an awe, or terror, of conventions I don't believe in. It comes over me at times like a sort of creeping paralysis, and makes me so sad!"</p>
<p>"You are getting tired, Sue. Oh&#8212;I forgot, darling! Yes, we'll go on at once."</p>
<p>They started in quest of the lodging, and at last found something that seemed to promise well, in Mildew Lane&#8212;a spot which to Jude was irresistible&#8212;though to Sue it was not so fascinating&#8212;a narrow lane close to the back of a college, but having no communication with it. The little houses were darkened to gloom by the high collegiate buildings, within which life was so far removed from that of the people in the lane as if it had been on opposite sides of the globe; yet only a thickness of wall divided them. Two or three of the houses had notices of rooms to let, and the newcomers knocked at the door of one, which a woman opened.</p>
<p>"Ah&#8212;listen!" said Jude suddenly, instead of addressing her.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Why the bells&#8212;what church can that be? The tones are familiar."</p>
<p>Another peal of bells had begun to sound out at some distance off.</p>
<p>"I don't know!" said the landlady tartly. "Did you knock to ask that?"</p>
<p>"No; for lodgings," said Jude, coming to himself.</p>
<p>The householder scrutinized Sue's figure a moment. "We haven't any to let," said she, shutting the door.</p>
<p>Jude looked discomfited, and the boy distressed. "Now, Jude," said Sue, "let me try. You don't know the way."</p>
<p>They found a second place hard by; but here the occupier, observing not only Sue, but the boy and the small children, said civilly, "I am sorry to say we don't let where there are children"; and also closed the door.</p>
<p>The small child squared its mouth and cried silently, with an instinct that trouble loomed. The boy sighed. "I don't like Christminster!" he said. "Are the great old houses gaols?"</p>
<p>"No; colleges," said Jude; "which perhaps you'll study in some day."</p>
<p>"I'd rather not!" the boy rejoined.</p>
<p>"Now we'll try again," said Sue. "I'll pull my cloak more round me&#8230; Leaving Kennetbridge for this place is like coming from Caiaphas to Pilate! &#8230; How do I look now, dear?"</p>
<p>"Nobody would notice it now," said Jude.</p>
<p>There was one other house, and they tried a third time. The woman here was more amiable; but she had little room to spare, and could only agree to take in Sue and the children if her husband could go elsewhere. This arrangement they perforce adopted, in the stress from delaying their search till so late. They came to terms with her, though her price was rather high for their pockets. But they could not afford to be critical till Jude had time to get a more permanent abode; and in this house Sue took possession of a back room on the second floor with an inner closet-room for the children. Jude stayed and had a cup of tea; and was pleased to find that the window commanded the back of another of the colleges. Kissing all four he went to get a few necessaries and look for lodgings for himself.</p>
<p>When he was gone the landlady came up to talk a little with Sue, and gather something of the circumstances of the family she had taken in. Sue had not the art of prevarication, and, after admitting several facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, she was startled by the landlady saying suddenly:</p>
<p>"Are you really a married woman?"</p>
<p>Sue hesitated; and then impulsively told the woman that her husband and herself had each been unhappy in their first marriages, after which, terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union, and lest the conditions of the contract should kill their love, yet wishing to be together, they had literally not found the courage to repeat it, though they had attempted it two or three times. Therefore, though in her own sense of the words she was a married woman, in the landlady's sense she was not.</p>
<p>The housewife looked embarrassed, and went downstairs. Sue sat by the window in a reverie, watching the rain. Her quiet was broken by the noise of someone entering the house, and then the voices of a man and woman in conversation in the passage below. The landlady's husband had arrived, and she was explaining to him the incoming of the lodgers during his absence.</p>
<p>His voice rose in sudden anger. "Now who wants such a woman here? and perhaps a confinement! &#8230; Besides, didn't I say I wouldn't have children? The hall and stairs fresh painted, to be kicked about by them! You must have known all was not straight with 'em&#8212;coming like that. Taking in a family when I said a single man."</p>
<p>The wife expostulated, but, as it seemed, the husband insisted on his point; for presently a tap came to Sue's door, and the woman appeared.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to tell you, ma'am," she said, "that I can't let you have the room for the week after all. My husband objects; and therefore I must ask you to go. I don't mind your staying over to-night, as it is getting late in the afternoon; but I shall be glad if you can leave early in the morning."</p>
<p>Though she knew that she was entitled to the lodging for a week, Sue did not wish to create a disturbance between the wife and husband, and she said she would leave as requested. When the landlady had gone Sue looked out of the window again. Finding that the rain had ceased she proposed to the boy that, after putting the little ones to bed, they should go out and search about for another place, and bespeak it for the morrow, so as not to be so hard-driven then as they had been that day.</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of unpacking her boxes, which had just been sent on from the station by Jude, they sallied out into the damp though not unpleasant streets, Sue resolving not to disturb her husband with the news of her notice to quit while he was perhaps worried in obtaining a lodging for himself. In the company of the boy she wandered into this street and into that; but though she tried a dozen different houses she fared far worse alone than she had fared in Jude's company, and could get nobody to promise her a room for the following day. Every householder looked askance at such a woman and child inquiring for accommodation in the gloom.</p>
<p>"I ought not to be born, ought I?" said the boy with misgiving.</p>
<p>Thoroughly tired at last Sue returned to the place where she was not welcome, but where at least she had temporary shelter. In her absence Jude had left his address; but knowing how weak he still was she adhered to her determination not to disturb him till the next day.</p>
<p>&#160;<a id="id_6-2"></a><br/>
&#160;</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00059">II</h2>
<p>Sue sat looking at the bare floor of the room, the house being little more than an old intramural cottage, and then she regarded the scene outside the uncurtained window. At some distance opposite, the outer walls of Sarcophagus College&#8212;silent, black, and windowless&#8212;threw their four centuries of gloom, bigotry, and decay into the little room she occupied, shutting out the moonlight by night and the sun by day. The outlines of Rubric College also were discernible beyond the other, and the tower of a third farther off still. She thought of the strange operation of a simple-minded man's ruling passion, that it should have led Jude, who loved her and the children so tenderly, to place them here in this depressing purlieu, because he was still haunted by his dream. Even now he did not distinctly hear the freezing negative that those scholared walls had echoed to his desire.</p>
<p>The failure to find another lodging, and the lack of room in this house for his father, had made a deep impression on the boy&#8212;a brooding undemonstrative horror seemed to have seized him. The silence was broken by his saying: "Mother, <i>what</i> shall we do to-morrow!"</p>
<p>"I don't know!" said Sue despondently. "I am afraid this will trouble your father."</p>
<p>"I wish Father was quite well, and there had been room for him! Then it wouldn't matter so much! Poor Father!"</p>
<p>"It wouldn't!"</p>
<p>"Can I do anything?"</p>
<p>"No! All is trouble, adversity, and suffering!"</p>
<p>"Father went away to give us children room, didn't he?"</p>
<p>"Partly."</p>
<p>"It would be better to be out o' the world than in it, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>"It would almost, dear."</p>
<p>"'Tis because of us children, too, isn't it, that you can't get a good lodging?"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;people do object to children sometimes."</p>
<p>"Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?"</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;because it is a law of nature."</p>
<p>"But we don't ask to be born?"</p>
<p>"No indeed."</p>
<p>"And what makes it worse with me is that you are not my real mother, and you needn't have had me unless you liked. I oughtn't to have come to 'ee&#8212;that's the real truth! I troubled 'em in Australia, and I trouble folk here. I wish I hadn't been born!"</p>
<p>"You couldn't help it, my dear."</p>
<p>"I think that whenever children be born that are not wanted they should be killed directly, before their souls come to 'em, and not allowed to grow big and walk about!"</p>
<p>Sue did not reply. She was doubtfully pondering how to treat this too reflective child.</p>
<p>She at last concluded that, so far as circumstances permitted, she would be honest and candid with one who entered into her difficulties like an aged friend.</p>
<p>"There is going to be another in our family soon," she hesitatingly remarked.</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"There is going to be another baby."</p>
<p>"What!" The boy jumped up wildly. "Oh God, Mother, you've never a-sent for another; and such trouble with what you've got!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have, I am sorry to say!" murmured Sue, her eyes glistening with suspended tears.</p>
<p>The boy burst out weeping. "Oh you don't care, you don't care!" he cried in bitter reproach. "How <i>ever</i> could you, Mother, be so wicked and cruel as this, when you needn't have done it till we was better off, and Father well! To bring us all into <i>more</i> trouble! No room for us, and Father a-forced to go away, and we turned out to-morrow; and yet you be going to have another of us soon! &#8230; 'Tis done o' purpose!&#8212;'tis&#8212;'tis!" He walked up and down sobbing.</p>
<p>"Y-you must forgive me, little Jude!" she pleaded, her bosom heaving now as much as the boy's. "I can't explain&#8212;I will when you are older. It does seem&#8212;as if I had done it on purpose, now we are in these difficulties! I can't explain, dear! But it&#8212;is not quite on purpose&#8212;I can't help it!"</p>
<p>"Yes it is&#8212;it must be! For nobody would interfere with us, like that, unless you agreed! I won't forgive you, ever, ever! I'll never believe you care for me, or Father, or any of us any more!"</p>
<p>He got up, and went away into the closet adjoining her room, in which a bed had been spread on the floor. There she heard him say: "If we children was gone there'd be no trouble at all!"</p>
<p>"Don't think that, dear," she cried, rather peremptorily. "But go to sleep!"</p>
<p>The following morning she awoke at a little past six, and decided to get up and run across before breakfast to the inn which Jude had informed her to be his quarters, to tell him what had happened before he went out. She arose softly, to avoid disturbing the children, who, as she knew, must be fatigued by their exertions of yesterday.</p>
<p>She found Jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he had chosen as a counterpoise to the expense of her lodging: and she explained to him her homelessness. He had been so anxious about her all night, he said. Somehow, now it was morning, the request to leave the lodgings did not seem such a depressing incident as it had seemed the night before, nor did even her failure to find another place affect her so deeply as at first. Jude agreed with her that it would not be worth while to insist upon her right to stay a week, but to take immediate steps for removal.</p>
<p>"You must all come to this inn for a day or two," he said. "It is a rough place, and it will not be so nice for the children, but we shall have more time to look round. There are plenty of lodgings in the suburbs&#8212;in my old quarter of Beersheba. Have breakfast with me now you are here, my bird. You are sure you are well? There will be plenty of time to get back and prepare the children's meal before they wake. In fact, I'll go with you."</p>
<p>She joined Jude in a hasty meal, and in a quarter of an hour they started together, resolving to clear out from Sue's too respectable lodging immediately. On reaching the place and going upstairs she found that all was quiet in the children's room, and called to the landlady in timorous tones to please bring up the tea-kettle and something for their breakfast. This was perfunctorily done, and producing a couple of eggs which she had brought with her she put them into the boiling kettle, and summoned Jude to watch them for the youngsters, while she went to call them, it being now about half-past eight o'clock.</p>
<p>Jude stood bending over the kettle, with his watch in his hand, timing the eggs, so that his back was turned to the little inner chamber where the children lay. A shriek from Sue suddenly caused him to start round. He saw that the door of the room, or rather closet&#8212;which had seemed to go heavily upon its hinges as she pushed it back&#8212;was open, and that Sue had sunk to the floor just within it. Hastening forward to pick her up he turned his eyes to the little bed spread on the boards; no children were there. He looked in bewilderment round the room. At the back of the door were fixed two hooks for hanging garments, and from these the forms of the two youngest children were suspended, by a piece of box-cord round each of their necks, while from a nail a few yards off the body of little Jude was hanging in a similar manner. An overturned chair was near the elder boy, and his glazed eyes were slanted into the room; but those of the girl and the baby boy were closed.</p>
<p>Half-paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene he let Sue lie, cut the cords with his pocket-knife and threw the three children on the bed; but the feel of their bodies in the momentary handling seemed to say that they were dead. He caught up Sue, who was in fainting fits, and put her on the bed in the other room, after which he breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a doctor.</p>
<p>When he got back Sue had come to herself, and the two helpless women, bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them, and the triplet of little corpses, formed a sight which overthrew his self-command. The nearest surgeon came in, but, as Jude had inferred, his presence was superfluous. The children were past saving, for though their bodies were still barely cold it was conjectured that they had been hanging more than an hour. The probability held by the parents later on, when they were able to reason on the case, was that the elder boy, on waking, looked into the outer room for Sue, and, finding her absent, was thrown into a fit of aggravated despondency that the events and information of the evening before had induced in his morbid temperament. Moreover a piece of paper was found upon the floor, on which was written, in the boy's hand, with the bit of lead pencil that he carried:<br/>
&#160;</p>
<blockquote><div>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="noindent"><i>Done because we are too menny.</i><br/>
&#160;</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At sight of this Sue's nerves utterly gave way, an awful conviction that her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the tragedy, throwing her into a convulsive agony which knew no abatement. They carried her away against her wish to a room on the lower floor; and there she lay, her slight figure shaken with her gasps, and her eyes staring at the ceiling, the woman of the house vainly trying to soothe her.</p>
<p>They could hear from this chamber the people moving about above, and she implored to be allowed to go back, and was only kept from doing so by the assurance that, if there were any hope, her presence might do harm, and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of herself lest she should endanger a coming life. Her inquiries were incessant, and at last Jude came down and told her there was no hope. As soon as she could speak she informed him what she had said to the boy, and how she thought herself the cause of this.</p>
<p>"No," said Jude. "It was in his nature to do it. The doctor says there are such boys springing up amongst us&#8212;boys of a sort unknown in the last generation&#8212;the outcome of new views of life. They seem to see all its terrors before they are old enough to have staying power to resist them. He says it is the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live. He's an advanced man, the doctor: but he can give no consolation to&#8212;"</p>
<p>Jude had kept back his own grief on account of her; but he now broke down; and this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in some degree distracted her from her poignant self-reproach. When everybody was gone, she was allowed to see the children.</p>
