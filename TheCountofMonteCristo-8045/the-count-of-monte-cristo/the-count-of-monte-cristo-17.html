<p id="id04454">"Certainly, your excellency; I saw her put to sea the same evening we
quitted Marseilles."</p>

<p id="id04455">"And the yacht."</p>

<p id="id04456">"Was ordered to remain at Martigues."</p>

<p id="id04457">"'Tis well. I wish you to write from time to time to the captains in
charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert."</p>

<p id="id04458">"And the steamboat?"</p>

<p id="id04459">"She is at Chalons?"</p>

<p id="id04460">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id04461">"The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels."</p>

<p id="id04462">"Very good."</p>

<p id="id04463">"When you have purchased the estate I desire, I want constant relays of
horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road."</p>

<p id="id04464">"Your excellency may depend upon me." The Count made a gesture of
satisfaction, descended the terrace steps, and sprang into his carriage,
which was whirled along swiftly to the banker's house. Danglars was
engaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad committee. But the
meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced.
As the count's title sounded on his ear he rose, and addressing
his colleagues, who were members of one or the other Chamber, he
said,&#8212;"Gentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most
ridiculous circumstance has occurred, which is this,&#8212;Thomson &amp; French,
the Roman bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling himself the
Count of Monte Cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit with me. I
confess this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the course
of my extensive foreign transactions, and you may readily suppose it has
greatly roused my curiosity. I took the trouble this morning to call
on the pretended count&#8212;if he were a real count he wouldn't be so rich.
But, would you believe it, 'He was not receiving.' So the master of
Monte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a
capricious beauty. I made inquiries, and found that the house in the
Champs Elysees is his own property, and certainly it was very decently
kept up. But," pursued Danglars with one of his sinister smiles, "an
order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part
of the banker to whom that order is given. I am very anxious to see this
man. I suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators of it little knew
whom they had to deal with. 'They laugh best who laugh last!'"</p>

<p id="id04465">Having delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree
of energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the
assembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous
furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the
Chaussee d'Antin. It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to
be shown, with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much
luxury. He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and
Fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals; but which,
mere copies as they were, seemed to feel their degradation in being
brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the
ceiling. The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars
into the room. With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed
to the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded arm-chair,
covered with white satin embroidered with gold. The count sat down. "I
have the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id04466">The count bowed. "And I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the<br>

Legion of Honor, and member of the Chamber of Deputies?"<br></p>

<p id="id04467">Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron's card.</p>

<p id="id04468">Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips. "You will, I trust,
excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your title when I first
addressed you," he said, "but you are aware that we are living under a
popular form of government, and that I am myself a representative of the
liberties of the people."</p>

<p id="id04469">"So much so," replied Monte Cristo, "that while you call yourself baron
you are not willing to call anybody else count."</p>

<p id="id04470">"Upon my word, monsieur," said Danglars with affected carelessness, "I
attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is, I
was made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor, in return for
services rendered, but"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04471">"But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs.
de Montmorency and Lafayette? That was a noble example to follow,
monsieur."</p>

<p id="id04472">"Why," replied Danglars, "not entirely so; with the servants,&#8212;you
understand."</p>

<p id="id04473">"I see; to your domestics you are 'my lord,' the journalists style
you 'monsieur,' while your constituents call you 'citizen.' These
are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government. I
understand perfectly." Again Danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was
no match for Monte Cristo in an argument of this sort, and he therefore
hastened to turn to subjects more congenial.</p>

<p id="id04474">"Permit me to inform you, Count," said he, bowing, "that I have received
a letter of advice from Thomson &amp; French, of Rome."</p>

<p id="id04475">"I am glad to hear it, baron,&#8212;for I must claim the privilege of
addressing you after the manner of your servants. I have acquired the
bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country
where barons are still barons by right of birth. But as regards the
letter of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that
will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for
money myself. You have received a regular letter of advice?"</p>

<p id="id04476">"Yes," said Danglars, "but I confess I didn't quite comprehend its
meaning."</p>

<p id="id04477">"Indeed?"</p>

<p id="id04478">"And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in
order to beg for an explanation."</p>

<p id="id04479">"Go on, monsieur. Here I am, ready to give you any explanation you
desire."</p>

<p id="id04480">"Why," said Danglers, "in the letter&#8212;I believe I have it about
me"&#8212;here he felt in his breast-pocket&#8212;"yes, here it is. Well, this
letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our house."</p>

<p id="id04481">"Well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?"</p>

<p id="id04482">"Merely the term unlimited&#8212;nothing else, certainly."</p>

<p id="id04483">"Is not that word known in France? The people who wrote are<br>

Anglo-Germans, you know."<br></p>

<p id="id04484">"Oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said;
but as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have doubts."</p>

<p id="id04485">"Is it possible?" asked the count, assuming all air and tone of the
utmost simplicity and candor. "Is it possible that Thomson &amp; French
are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers? Pray tell me what
you think, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some
considerable property in their hands."</p>

<p id="id04486">"Thomson &amp; French are perfectly solvent," replied Danglars, with an
almost mocking smile: "but the word unlimited, in financial affairs, is
so extremely vague."</p>

<p id="id04487">"Is, in fact, unlimited," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04488">"Precisely what I was about to say," cried Danglars. "Now what is vague
is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, 'when in doubt, keep out.'"</p>

<p id="id04489">"Meaning to say," rejoined Monte Cristo, "that however Thomson &amp; French
may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly, the Baron
Danglars is not disposed to follow their example."</p>

<p id="id04490">"Not at all."</p>

<p id="id04491">"Plainly enough. Messrs. Thomson &amp; French set no bounds to their
engagements while those of M. Danglars have their limits; he is a wise
man, according to his own showing."</p>

<p id="id04492">"Monsieur," replied the banker, drawing himself up with a haughty air,
"the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned."</p>

<p id="id04493">"It seems, then, reserved for me," said Monte Cristo coldly, "to be the
first to do so."</p>

<p id="id04494">"By what right, sir?"</p>

<p id="id04495">"By right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations you
have demanded, which certainly must have some motive."</p>

<p id="id04496">Once more Danglars bit his lips. It was the second time he had been
worsted, and this time on his own ground. His forced politeness sat
awkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence. Monte Cristo
on the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by
a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus
possessed the advantage.</p>

<p id="id04497">"Well, sir," resumed Danglars, after a brief silence, "I will endeavor
to make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me for what sum
you propose to draw upon me?"</p>

<p id="id04498">"Why, truly," replied Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an inch of
the ground he had gained, "my reason for desiring an 'unlimited' credit
was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need."</p>

<p id="id04499">The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand. So
throwing himself back in his arm-chair, he said, with an arrogant and
purse-proud air,&#8212;"Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your
wishes; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house
of Danglars, however limited, are still equal to meeting the largest
demands; and were you even to require a million"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04500">"I beg your pardon," interposed Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04501">"I said a million," replied Danglars, with the confidence of ignorance.</p>

<p id="id04502">"But could I do with a million?" retorted the count. "My dear sir, if a
trifle like that could suffice me, I should never have given myself the
trouble of opening an account. A million? Excuse my smiling when you
speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or
dressing-case." And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket
a small case containing his visiting-cards, and drew forth two orders on
the treasury for 500,000 francs each, payable at sight to the bearer.
A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method
of correction. The effect of the present revelation was stunning; he
trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy. The pupils of his eyes, as he
gazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly.</p>

<p id="id04503">"Come, come," said Monte Cristo, "confess honestly that you have not
perfect confidence in Thomson &amp; French. I understand, and foreseeing
that such might be the case, I took, in spite of my ignorance of
affairs, certain precautions. See, here are two similar letters to that
you have yourself received; one from the house of Arstein &amp; Eskeles of
Vienna, to Baron Rothschild, the other drawn by Baring of London, upon
M. Laffitte. Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare
you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of
these two firms." The blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely
vanquished; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the
count, who held them carelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded
to scrutinize the signatures, with a minuteness that the count might
have regarded as insulting, had it not suited his present purpose to
mislead the banker. "Oh, sir," said Danglars, after he had convinced
himself of the authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if
to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him,&#8212;"three
letters of unlimited credit! I can be no longer mistrustful, but
you must pardon me, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of
astonishment."</p>

<p id="id04504">"Nay," answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, "'tis
not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be
incommoded. Then, you can let me have some money, can you not?"</p>

<p id="id04505">"Whatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders."</p>

<p id="id04506">"Why," replied Monte Cristo, "since we mutually understand each
other&#8212;for such I presume is the case?" Danglars bowed assentingly. "You
are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your
mind?"</p>

<p id="id04507">"Oh, my dear count," exclaimed Danglars, "I never for an instant
entertained such a feeling towards you."</p>

<p id="id04508">"No, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that
we have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and
suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable
expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04509">"Six millions!" gasped Danglars&#8212;"so be it."</p>

<p id="id04510">"Then, if I should require more," continued Monte Cristo in a careless
manner, "why, of course, I should draw upon you; but my present
intention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during that
period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned. However, we
shall see. Be kind enough, then, to send me 500,000 francs to-morrow. I
shall be at home till midday, or if not, I will leave a receipt with my
steward."</p>

<p id="id04511">"The money you desire shall be at your house by ten o'clock to-morrow
morning, my dear count," replied Danglars. "How would you like to have
it? in gold, silver, or notes?"</p>

<p id="id04512">"Half in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please," said
the count, rising from his seat.</p>

<p id="id04513">"I must confess to you, count," said Danglars, "that I have hitherto<br>

imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of<br>

Europe, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me.<br>

May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?"<br></p>

<p id="id04514">"It has been in the family a very long while," returned Monte Cristo, "a
sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period
of years, during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital.
The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches
occurred only a short time ago, and they have only been employed by me
within the last few years. Your ignorance on the subject, therefore, is
easily accounted for. However, you will be better informed as to me and
my possessions ere long." And the count, while pronouncing these latter
words, accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to
strike terror into poor Franz d'Epinay.</p>

<p id="id04515">"With your tastes, and means of gratifying them," continued Danglars,
"you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable
millionaires quite in the shade. If I mistake not you are an admirer of
paintings, at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be
bestowing on mine when I entered the room. If you will permit me, I
shall be happy to show you my picture gallery, composed entirely of
works by the ancient masters&#8212;warranted as such. Not a modern picture
among them. I cannot endure the modern school of painting."</p>

<p id="id04516">"You are perfectly right in objecting to them, for this one great
fault&#8212;that they have not yet had time to become old."</p>

<p id="id04517">"Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen,
Bartoloni, and Canova?&#8212;all foreign artists, for, as you may perceive, I
think but very indifferently of our French sculptors."</p>

<p id="id04518">"You have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your
compatriots."</p>

<p id="id04519">"But all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each
other. For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable to
you) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglars&#8212;excuse my impatience,
my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a member of the
family." Monte Cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the proffered
honor; Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery.
"Is the baroness at home?" inquired Danglars.</p>

<p id="id04520">"Yes, my lord," answered the man.</p>

<p id="id04521">"And alone?"</p>

<p id="id04522">"No, my lord, madame has visitors."</p>

<p id="id04523">"Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or
do you desire to preserve a strict incognito?"</p>

<p id="id04524">"No, indeed," replied Monte Cristo with a smile, "I do not arrogate to
myself the right of so doing."</p>

<p id="id04525">"And who is with madame?&#8212;M. Debray?" inquired Danglars, with an air of
indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile, acquainted as
he was with the secrets of the banker's domestic life.</p>

<p id="id04526">"Yes, my lord," replied the servant, "M. Debray is with madame."
Danglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, "M.
Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the
Minister of the Interior. As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered
herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient
families in France. Her maiden name was De Servieres, and her first
husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne."</p>

<p id="id04527">"I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already met<br>

M. Lucien Debray."<br></p>

<p id="id04528">"Ah, indeed?" said Danglars; "and where was that?"</p>

<p id="id04529">"At the house of M. de Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id04530">"Ah, ha, you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?"</p>

<p id="id04531">"We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome."</p>

<p id="id04532">"True, true," cried Danglars. "Let me see; have I not heard talk of
some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of
his having had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he used
to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return
from Italy."</p>

<p id="id04533">"Her ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen," said the servant,
who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress. "With your
permission," said Danglars, bowing, "I will precede you, to show you the
way."</p>

<p id="id04534">"By all means," replied Monte Cristo; "I follow you."</p>

<h2 id="id04535" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays.</h2>

<p id="id04536">The baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments,
in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the
gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame
Danglars&#8212;a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered
with white Indian muslin. The chairs were of ancient workmanship
and materials; over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and
shepherdesses, after the style and manner of Boucher; and at each side
pretty medallions in crayons, harmonizing well with the furnishings of
this charming apartment, the only one throughout the great mansion
in which any distinctive taste prevailed. The truth was, it had been
entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by M. Danglars
and his architect, who had been selected to aid the baron in the great
work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and
celebrated decorator of the day. The decorations of the boudoir had then
been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debray. M. Danglars,
however, while possessing a great admiration for the antique, as it
was understood during the time of the Directory, entertained the most
sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife's favorite
sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted to intrude,
unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more
agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had rather the air and
manner of a person who was himself introduced, than that of being
the presenter of another, his reception being cordial or frigid, in
proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or
displease the baroness.</p>

<p id="id04537">Madame Danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still
strikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate piece
of cabinet and inlaid work, while Lucien Debray, standing before a small
work-table, was turning over the pages of an album. Lucien had found
time, preparatory to the count's arrival, to relate many particulars
respecting him to Madame Danglars. It will be remembered that Monte
Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party
assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf; and although
Debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never
been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the
impressive look and manner of the count, consequently the description
given by Lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own
heated imagination. Already excited by the wonderful stories related of
the count by De Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly
listened to, and fully credited, all the additional circumstances
detailed by Debray. This posing at the piano and over the album was only
a little ruse adopted by way of precaution. A most gracious welcome and
unusual smile were bestowed on M. Danglars; the count, in return for
his gentlemanly bow, received a formal though graceful courtesy, while
Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition, and with
Danglars a free and easy nod.</p>

<p id="id04538">"Baroness," said Danglars, "give me leave to present to you the Count
of Monte Cristo, who has been most warmly recommended to me by my
correspondents at Rome. I need but mention one fact to make all the
ladies in Paris court his notice, and that is, that he has come to take
up his abode in Paris for a year, during which brief period he proposes
to spend six millions of money. That means balls, dinners, and lawn
parties without end, in all of which I trust the count will remember
us, as he may depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble
entertainments." In spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this
address, Madame Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable
interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months,
and who had selected Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.
"And when did you arrive here?" inquired she.</p>

<p id="id04539">"Yesterday morning, madame."</p>

<p id="id04540">"Coming, as usual, I presume, from the extreme end of the globe? Pardon
me&#8212;at least, such I have heard is your custom."</p>

<p id="id04541">"Nay, madame. This time I have merely come from Cadiz."</p>

<p id="id04542">"You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit. Paris
is a horrible place in summer. Balls, parties, and fetes are over; the
Italian opera is in London; the French opera everywhere except in Paris.
As for the Theatre Francais, you know, of course, that it is nowhere.
The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the Champ de
Mars and Satory. Do you propose entering any horses at either of these
races, count?"</p>

<p id="id04543">"I shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good
fortune to find some one who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas
of amusement."</p>

<p id="id04544">"Are you fond of horses, count?"</p>

<p id="id04545">"I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and
you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things&#8212;the
fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women."</p>

<p id="id04546">"Nay, count," said the baroness, "it would have been somewhat more
gallant to have placed the ladies first."</p>

<p id="id04547">"You see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor
to guide me in all my sayings and doings here." At this instant the
favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir; approaching
her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone. Madame Danglars
turned very pale, then exclaimed,&#8212;"I cannot believe it; the thing is
impossible."</p>

<p id="id04548">"I assure you, madame," replied the woman, "it is as I have said."
Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, "Is
this true?"</p>

<p id="id04549">"Is what true, madame?" inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.</p>

<p id="id04550">"What my maid tells me."</p>

<p id="id04551">"But what does she tell you?"</p>

<p id="id04552">"That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage,
he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his
knowledge. I desire to know what is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p id="id04553">"Be kind enough, madame, to listen to me," said Danglars.</p>

<p id="id04554">"Oh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear what
explanation you will give. These two gentlemen shall decide between us;
but, first, I will state the case to them. Gentlemen," continued the
baroness, "among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars, are
two that belong exclusively to me&#8212;a pair of the handsomest and most
spirited creatures to be found in Paris. But to you, at least, M.
Debray, I need not give a further description, because to you my
beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known. Well, I had promised
Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive to-morrow to the
Bois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they
are gone&#8212;positively gone. No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them to
the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs.
Oh, what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary speculators!"</p>

<p id="id04555">"Madame," replied Danglars, "the horses were not sufficiently quiet
for you; they were scarcely four years old, and they made me extremely
uneasy on your account."</p>

<p id="id04556">"Nonsense," retorted the baroness; "you could not have entertained any
alarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware that I have
had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris. But,
perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?"</p>

<p id="id04557">"My dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise
you another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and
steady." The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable
contempt, while her husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal
gesture, turned towards Monte Cristo and said,&#8212;"Upon my word, count,
I am quite sorry not to have met you sooner. You are setting up an
establishment, of course?"</p>

<p id="id04558">"Why, yes," replied the count.</p>

<p id="id04559">"I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses. I have
almost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was anxious
to get rid of them upon any terms. They were only fit for a young man."</p>

<p id="id04560">"I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me," said Monte
Cristo; "but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of
carriage-horses, and I do not think they were dear. There they are.
Come, M. Debray, you are a connoisseur, I believe, let me have your
opinion upon them." As Debray walked towards the window, Danglars
approached his wife. "I could not tell you before others," said he in a
low tone, "the reason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous
price was offered me this morning for them. Some madman or fool, bent
upon ruining himself as fast as he can, actually sent his steward to
me to purchase them at any cost; and the fact is, I have gained 16,000
francs by the sale of them. Come, don't look so angry, and you shall
have 4,000 francs of the money to do what you like with, and Eugenie
shall have 2,000. There, what do you think now of the affair? Wasn't
I right to part with the horses?" Madame Danglars surveyed her husband
with a look of withering contempt.</p>

<p id="id04561">"Great heavens?" suddenly exclaimed Debray.</p>

<p id="id04562">"What is it?" asked the baroness.</p>

<p id="id04563">"I cannot be mistaken; there are your horses! The very animals we were
speaking of, harnessed to the count's carriage!"</p>

<p id="id04564">"My dappled grays?" demanded the baroness, springing to the window.
"'Tis indeed they!" said she. Danglars looked absolutely stupefied. "How
very singular," cried Monte Cristo with well-feigned astonishment.</p>

<p id="id04565">"I cannot believe it," murmured the banker. Madame Danglars whispered
a few words in the ear of Debray, who approached Monte Cristo, saying,
"The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses."</p>

<p id="id04566">"I scarcely know," replied the count; "it was a little surprise prepared
for me by my steward, and cost me&#8212;well, somewhere about 30,000 francs."
Debray conveyed the count's reply to the baroness. Poor Danglars looked
so crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air
towards him. "See," said the count, "how very ungrateful women are. Your
kind attention, in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing
of the horses, does not seem to have made the least impression on her.
But so it is; a woman will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that
which is dangerous to that which is safe. Therefore, in my opinion, my
dear baron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies,
and allow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows,
why, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves." Danglars made
no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between
himself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that of Olympic
Jove, predicted a storm. Debray, who perceived the gathering clouds,
and felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars' rage,
suddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take his
leave; while Monte Cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy
the advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and departed,
leaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.</p>

<p id="id04567">"Excellent," murmured Monte Cristo to himself, as he came away. "All
has gone according to my wishes. The domestic peace of this family is
henceforth in my hands. Now, then, to play another master-stroke, by
which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wife&#8212;delightful!
Still," added he, "amid all this, I have not yet been presented to
Mademoiselle Eugenie Danglars, whose acquaintance I should have been
glad to make. But," he went on with his peculiar smile, "I am here in
Paris, and have plenty of time before me&#8212;by and by will do for that."
With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home. Two
hours afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle
from the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite
"dappled grays," protesting that he could not endure the idea of making
his entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that
his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman's
regrets. The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen
on them in the morning; only, by the count's orders, in the centre of
each rosette that adorned either side of their heads, had been fastened
a large diamond.</p>

<p id="id04568">To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote, requesting him to excuse the
whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire, and to beg the baroness to
pardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses.</p>

<p id="id04569">During the evening, Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil, accompanied
by Ali. The following day, about three o'clock, a single blow struck on
the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count. "Ali," observed
his master, as the Nubian entered the chamber, "you have frequently
explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the
lasso, have you not?" Ali drew himself up proudly, and then returned a
sign in the affirmative. "I thought I did not mistake. With your lasso
you could stop an ox?" Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture. "Or a
tiger?" Ali bowed his head in token of assent. "A lion even?" Ali sprung
forwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso, then of a
strangled lion.</p>

<p id="id04570">"I understand," said Monte Cristo; "you wish to tell me you have hunted
the lion?" Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he
had indeed both chased and captured many lions. "But do you believe
you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with
ungovernable fury?" The Nubian smiled. "It is well," said Monte Cristo.
"Then listen to me. Ere long a carriage will dash past here, drawn by
the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday; now, at the
risk of your own life, you must manage to stop those horses before my
door."</p>

<p id="id04571">Ali descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement
immediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line
he had traced to the count, who was watching him. The count patted him
gently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased
and gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a
projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating
himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte Cristo
re-entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.
Still, as five o'clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily
expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and
uneasiness might be observed in his manner. He stationed himself in a
room commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless
steps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of
approaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but the
regularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque
proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his
favorite occupation. Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing
wheels was heard, and almost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by
a pair of wild, ungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove
in vain to restrain their furious speed.</p>

<p id="id04572">In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight
clasped in each other's arms. Terror seemed to have deprived them even
of the power of uttering a cry. The carriage creaked and rattled as it
flew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels
would have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road,
and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.</p>

<p id="id04573">Ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket,
threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its
triple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by
the violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which
snapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.
Gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from
his box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse,
and held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain,
sunk beside his companion. All this was achieved in much less time
than is occupied in the recital. The brief space had, however, been
sufficient for a man, followed by a number of servants, to rush from
the house before which the accident had occurred, and, as the coachman
opened the door of the carriage, to take from it a lady who was
convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand, while with the other
she pressed to her bosom the young boy, who had lost consciousness.</p>

<p id="id04574">Monte Cristo carried them both to the salon, and deposited them on a
sofa. "Compose yourself, madame," said he; "all danger is over." The
woman looked up at these words, and, with a glance far more expressive
than any entreaties could have been, pointed to her child, who still
continued insensible. "I understand the nature of your alarms, madame,"
said the count, carefully examining the child, "but I assure you there
is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness; your little charge has not
received the least injury; his insensibility is merely the effects of
terror, and will soon pass."</p>

<p id="id04575">"Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears? See
how deadly pale he is! My child, my darling Edward; speak to your
mother&#8212;open your dear eyes and look on me once again! Oh, sir, in pity
send for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for
the recovery of my boy."</p>

<p id="id04576">With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, Monte Cristo signed to
the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening
a casket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass
incrusted with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of which
he let fall a single drop on the child's lips. Scarcely had it reached
them, ere the boy, though still pale as marble, opened his eyes, and
eagerly gazed around him. At this, the delight of the mother was almost
frantic. "Where am I?" exclaimed she; "and to whom am I indebted for so
happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm?"</p>

<p id="id04577">"Madame," answered the count, "you are under the roof of one who esteems
himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further
continuance of your sufferings."</p>

<p id="id04578">"My wretched curiosity has brought all this about," pursued the lady.
"All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars' beautiful horses,
and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the
high praise given to them."</p>

<p id="id04579">"Is it possible," exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment,
"that these horses belong to the baroness?"</p>

<p id="id04580">"They do, indeed. May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame<br>

Danglars?"<br></p>

<p id="id04581">"I have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that
threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been
the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have
incurred. I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the
baroness evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them
back to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them
from my hands."</p>

<p id="id04582">"You are, then, doubtless, the Count of Monte Cristo, of whom Hermine
has talked to me so much?"</p>

<p id="id04583">"You have rightly guessed, madame," replied the count.</p>

<p id="id04584">"And I am Madame Heloise de Villefort." The count bowed with the air of
a person who hears a name for the first time. "How grateful will M. de
Villefort be for all your goodness; how thankfully will he acknowledge
that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child! Most
certainly, but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant, this
dear child and myself must both have perished."</p>

<p id="id04585">"Indeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in."</p>

<p id="id04586">"I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your
man."</p>

<p id="id04587">"I beseech you, madame," replied Monte Cristo "not to spoil Ali, either
by too great praise or rewards. I cannot allow him to acquire the habit
of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render.
Ali is my slave, and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty
to me."</p>

<p id="id04588">"Nay," interposed Madame de Villefort, on whom the authoritative style
adopted by the count made a deep impression, "nay, but consider that to
preserve my life he has risked his own."</p>

<p id="id04589">"His life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my
having myself saved him from death." Madame de Villefort made no further
reply; her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the
person who, from the first instant she saw him, had made so powerful
an impression on her. During the evident preoccupation of Madame de
Villefort, Monte Cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of
the boy she kept folded in her arms, lavishing on him the most tender
endearments. The child was small for his age, and unnaturally pale. A
mass of straight black hair, defying all attempts to train or curl
it, fell over his projecting forehead, and hung down to his shoulders,
giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love
of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment. His mouth
was large, and the lips, which had not yet regained their color,
were particularly thin; in fact, the deep and crafty look, giving a
predominant expression to the child's face, belonged rather to a boy of
twelve or fourteen than to one so young. His first movement was to free
himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother, and to
rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of
elixir; then, without asking permission of any one, he proceeded, in all
the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims
or caprices, to pull the corks out of all the bottles.</p>

<p id="id04590">"Touch nothing, my little friend," cried the count eagerly; "some of
those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale."</p>

<p id="id04591">Madame de Villefort became very pale, and, seizing her son's arm, drew
him anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also
cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost
upon the count. At this moment Ali entered. At sight of him Madame de
Villefort uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child
still closer towards her, she said, "Edward, dearest, do you see that
good man? He has shown very great courage and resolution, for he exposed
his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us, and
would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces. Thank him, then,
my child, in your very best manner; for, had he not come to our aid,
neither you nor I would have been alive to speak our thanks." The child
stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner,
saying, "He's too ugly."</p>

<p id="id04592">The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while
Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation
very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.
"This lady," said the Count, speaking to Ali in the Arabic language, "is
desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives; but
the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly." Ali turned his intelligent
countenance towards the boy, on whom he gazed without any apparent
emotion; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the
practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded to the
heart.</p>

<p id="id04593">"Will you permit me to inquire," said Madame de Villefort, as she arose
to take her leave, "whether you usually reside here?"</p>

<p id="id04594">"No, I do not," replied Monte Cristo; "it is a small place I have
purchased quite lately. My place of abode is No. 30, Avenue des Champs
Elysees; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright, and are,
no doubt, desirous of returning home. Anticipating your wishes, I have
desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages,
and Ali, he whom you think so very ugly," continued he, addressing the
boy with a smiling air, "will have the honor of driving you home, while
your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your
calash. As soon as that important business is concluded, I will have a
pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to Madame Danglars."</p>

<p id="id04595">"I dare not return with those dreadful horses," said Madame de<br>

Villefort.<br></p>

<p id="id04596">"You will see," replied Monte Cristo, "that they will be as different as
possible in the hands of Ali. With him they will be gentle and docile
as lambs." Ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the
animals, who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty,
he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic
vinegar, and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths.
Then, commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed them well all over
their bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd
collected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed the pacified
animals to the count's chariot, took the reins in his hands, and mounted
the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed
the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses, he was
actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before
he could induce them to start; and even then all that could be obtained
from the celebrated "dappled grays," now changed into a couple of dull,
sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering pace, kept up with
so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours
returning to her residence in the Faubourg St. Honore.</p>

<p id="id04597">Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been
gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id04598">Dear Hermine,&#8212;I have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent
danger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo we were
talking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see to-day. I
remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic
and exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause to admit that
your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of
his merits. Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they darted forward
like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate, that there
seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of being
dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress,
when a strange-looking man,&#8212;an Arab, a negro, or a Nubian, at least
a black of some nation or other&#8212;at a signal from the count, whose
domestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals, even
at the risk of being trampled to death himself; and certainly he must
have had a most wonderful escape. The count then hastened to us, and
took us into his house, where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to
life. He sent us home in his own carriage. Yours will be returned to you
to-morrow. You will find your horses in bad condition, from the results
of this accident; they seem thoroughly stupefied, as if sulky and vexed
at having been conquered by man. The count, however, has commissioned
me to assure you that two or three days' rest, with plenty of barley for
their sole food during that time, will bring them back to as fine, that
is as terrifying, a condition as they were in yesterday. Adieu! I cannot
return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but, after all,
I ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses, more
especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the
Count of Monte Cristo,&#8212;and certainly that illustrious personage, apart
from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of, seemed
to me one of those curiously interesting problems I, for one, delight in
solving at any risk, even if it were to necessitate another drive to
the Bois behind your horses. Edward endured the accident with miraculous
courage&#8212;he did not utter a single cry, but fell lifeless into my arms;
nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over. I doubt not you
will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection, but
there is a soul of iron in that delicate, fragile body. Valentine sends
many affectionate remembrances to your dear Eugenie. I embrace you with
all my heart.</p>

<p id="id04599">Heloise de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id04600">P.S.&#8212;Do pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte<br>

Cristo at your house. I must and will see him again. I have just made<br>

M. de Villefort promise to call on him, and I hope the visit will be<br>

returned.<br></p>

<p id="id04601">That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere. Albert
related it to his mother; Chateau-Renaud recounted it at the Jockey
Club, and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister;
even Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation
of the count's courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the
greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the
aristocracy. Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who
left their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort, with the
design of renewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her
lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.
As for M. de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of Heloise to the
letter,&#8212;donned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves, ordered
the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery, and
drove that same night to No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Elysees.</p>

<h2 id="id04602" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 48. Ideology.</h2>

<p id="id04603">If the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with
the ways of Parisian society, he would have appreciated better the
significance of the step which M. de Villefort had taken. Standing well
at court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch,
whether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked
upon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced
a political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly
supported by others, without being really liked by anybody, M. de
Villefort held a high position in the magistracy, and maintained
his eminence like a Harlay or a Mole. His drawing-room, under the
regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first
marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated Paris
salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of
rigid etiquette were carefully maintained. A freezing politeness,
a strict fidelity to government principles, a profound contempt for
theories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of ideality,&#8212;these were
the elements of private and public life displayed by M. de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id04604">He was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist. His relations
with the former court, of which he always spoke with dignity and
respect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so many
things, that not only was he always carefully considered, but sometimes
consulted. Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to
get rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who rebelled
against their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress. This
fortress was his post as king's attorney, all the advantages of which
he exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have resigned
but to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by opposition.
Ordinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits. His wife
visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the
weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as
an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a manifestation of
professed superiority&#8212;in fact, the application of the axiom, "Pretend
to think well of yourself, and the world will think well of you," an
axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the
Greeks, "Know thyself," a knowledge for which, in our days, we have
substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing
others.</p>

<p id="id04605">To his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies,
he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were neither the
one nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man. He had a haughty
bearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing
and inquisitorial. Four successive revolutions had built and cemented
the pedestal upon which his fortune was based. M. de Villefort had the
reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in
France. He gave a ball every year, at which he appeared for a quarter of
an hour only,&#8212;that is to say, five and forty minutes less than the king
is visible at his balls. He was never seen at the theatres, at concerts,
or in any place of public resort. Occasionally, but seldom, he played
at whist, and then care was taken to select partners worthy of
him&#8212;sometimes they were ambassadors, sometimes archbishops, or
sometimes a prince, or a president, or some dowager duchess. Such was
the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of Monte
Cristo's door. The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort at the
moment when the count, leaning over a large table, was tracing on a map
the route from St. Petersburg to China.</p>

<p id="id04606">The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would
have employed in entering a court of justice. He was the same man, or
rather the development of the same man, whom we have heretofore seen as
assistant attorney at Marseilles. Nature, according to her way, had
made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself. From being
slender he had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his
deep-set eyes were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes
seemed to be an integral portion of his face. He dressed entirely in
black, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance
was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost
imperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of
blood traced with a delicate brush. Although master of himself, Monte
Cristo, scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose
salute he returned, and who, distrustful by habit, and especially
incredulous as to social prodigies, was much more despised to look
upon "the noble stranger," as Monte Cristo was already called, as an
adventurer in search of new fields, or an escaped criminal, rather than
as a prince of the Holy See, or a sultan of the Thousand and One Nights.</p>

<p id="id04607">"Sir," said Villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in
their oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will not, divest
themselves in society, "sir, the signal service which you yesterday
rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my
thanks. I have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and to express
to you my overwhelming gratitude." And as he said this, the "eye severe"
of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance. He spoke
in a voice of the procureur-general, with the rigid inflexibility of
neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say (as we have before
observed) that he was the living statue of the law.</p>

<p id="id04608">"Monsieur," replied the count, with a chilling air, "I am very happy to
have been the means of preserving a son to his mother, for they say that
the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good fortune
which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to dispense with
a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly great honor; for
I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which
he now bestows on me,&#8212;a favor which, however estimable, is unequal
to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness." Villefort,
astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected, started like a
soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears, and
a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in
the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by no
means a highly bred gentleman. He glanced around, in order to seize
on something on which the conversation might turn, and seemed to fall
easily on a topic. He saw the map which Monte Cristo had been examining
when he entered, and said, "You seem geographically engaged, sir? It is
a rich study for you, who, as I learn, have seen as many lands as are
delineated on this map."</p>

<p id="id04609">"Yes, sir," replied the count; "I have sought to make of the human
race, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on individuals&#8212;a
physiological study. I have believed it was much easier to descend from
the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole. It is
an algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown
quantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down, sir, I beg
of you."</p>

<p id="id04610">Monte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to take
the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell back
into his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort entered.
Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having his back
towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical chart which
furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,&#8212;a conversation
which assumed, as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and
Morcerf, a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the situation. "Ah,
you philosophize," replied Villefort, after a moment's silence, during
which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he took
breath; "well, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to do, I
should seek a more amusing occupation."</p>

<p id="id04611">"Why, in truth, sir," was Monte Cristo's reply, "man is but an ugly
caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you
said, I think, that I had nothing else to do. Now, really, let me ask,
sir, have you?&#8212;do you believe you have anything to do? or to speak in
plain terms, do you really think that what you do deserves being called
anything?"</p>

<p id="id04612">Villefort's astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly
made by his strange adversary. It was a long time since the magistrate
had heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more exactly,
it was the first time he had ever heard of it. The procureur exerted
himself to reply. "Sir," he responded, "you are a stranger, and I
believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent
in Oriental countries, so you are not aware how human justice, so
expeditious in barbarous countries, takes with us a prudent and
well-studied course."</p>

<p id="id04613">"Oh, yes&#8212;yes, I do, sir; it is the pede claudo of the ancients. I know
all that, for it is with the justice of all countries especially that I
have occupied myself&#8212;it is with the criminal procedure of all nations
that I have compared natural justice, and I must say, sir, that it is
the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of retaliation, that I
have most frequently found to be according to the law of God."</p>

<p id="id04614">"If this law were adopted, sir," said the procureur, "it would greatly
simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not (as
you just observed) have much to do."</p>

<p id="id04615">"It may, perhaps, come to this in time," observed Monte Cristo; "you
know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and
simplicity is always perfection."</p>

<p id="id04616">"In the meanwhile," continued the magistrate, "our codes are in full
force, with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic
customs, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which,
you will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs
tedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong
power of brain to retain it."</p>

<p id="id04617">"I agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with respect
to the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code, but as
regards the codes of all nations. The English, Turkish, Japanese, Hindu
laws, are as familiar to me as the French laws, and thus I was right,
when I said to you, that relatively (you know that everything is
relative, sir)&#8212;that relatively to what I have done, you have very
little to do; but that relatively to all I have learned, you have yet a
great deal to learn."</p>

<p id="id04618">"But with what motive have you learned all this?" inquired Villefort,
in astonishment. Monte Cristo smiled. "Really, sir," he observed, "I see
that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior
man, you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of
society, beginning with man, and ending with man&#8212;that is to say, in
the most restricted, most narrow view which it is possible for human
understanding to embrace."</p>

<p id="id04619">"Pray, sir, explain yourself," said Villefort, more and more astonished,<br>

"I really do&#8212;not&#8212;understand you&#8212;perfectly."<br></p>

<p id="id04620">"I say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of
nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of
the sublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize
before you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions
have been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom God has
put above those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a
mission to follow out, instead of a post to fill&#8212;I say that they
escape your narrow, limited field of observation. It is thus that human
weakness fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs. Tobias took
the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man. The
nations took Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a conqueror
similar to other conquerors, and it was necessary for both to reveal
their missions, that they might be known and acknowledged; one was
compelled to say, 'I am the angel of the Lord'; and the other, 'I am
the hammer of God,' in order that the divine essence in both might be
revealed."</p>

<p id="id04621">"Then," said Villefort, more and more amazed, and really supposing he
was speaking to a mystic or a madman, "you consider yourself as one of
those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?"</p>

<p id="id04622">"And why not?" said Monte Cristo coldly.</p>

<p id="id04623">"Your pardon, sir," replied Villefort, quite astounded, "but you will
excuse me if, when I presented myself to you, I was unaware that I
should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far
surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men. It is not usual
with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like
yourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune&#8212;at least, so it
is said&#8212;and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely
repeat;&#8212;it is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy
beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in
philosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has
disinherited from the goods of this world."</p>

<p id="id04624">"Really, sir," retorted the count, "have you attained the eminent
situation in which you are, without having admitted, or even without
having met with exceptions? and do you never use your eyes, which must
have acquired so much finesse and certainty, to divine, at a glance, the
kind of man by whom you are confronted? Should not a magistrate be not
merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder
of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a
touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or
less of alloy?"</p>

<p id="id04625">"Sir," said Villefort, "upon my word, you overcome me. I really never
heard a person speak as you do."</p>

<p id="id04626">"Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general
conditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper
spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings."</p>

<p id="id04627">"And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and
invisible beings mingle amongst us?"</p>

<p id="id04628">"Why should they not? Can you see the air you breathe, and yet without
which you could not for a moment exist?"</p>

<p id="id04629">"Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?"</p>

<p id="id04630">"Yes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume a
material form. You touch them, come in contact with them, speak to them,
and they reply to you."</p>

<p id="id04631">"Ah," said Villefort, smiling, "I confess I should like to be warned
when one of these beings is in contact with me."</p>

<p id="id04632">"You have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned just
now, and I now again warn you."</p>

<p id="id04633">"Then you yourself are one of these marked beings?"</p>

<p id="id04634">"Yes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found himself in
a position similar to mine. The dominions of kings are limited either
by mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration of
language. My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an
Italian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard&#8212;I am
a cosmopolite. No country can say it saw my birth. God alone knows what
country will see me die. I adopt all customs, speak all languages. You
believe me to be a Frenchman, for I speak French with the same facility
and purity as yourself. Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an Arab;
Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; Haidee, my slave, thinks
me a Greek. You may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no country,
asking no protection from any government, acknowledging no man as
my brother, not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the
obstacles which paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me. I have only
two adversaries&#8212;I will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I
subdue even them,&#8212;they are time and distance. There is a third, and the
most terrible&#8212;that is my condition as a mortal being. This alone can
stop me in my onward career, before I have attained the goal at which
I aim, for all the rest I have reduced to mathematical terms. What men
call the chances of fate&#8212;namely, ruin, change, circumstances&#8212;I have
fully anticipated, and if any of these should overtake me, yet it
will not overwhelm me. Unless I die, I shall always be what I am, and
therefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard, even from
the mouths of kings&#8212;for kings have need, and other persons have fear
of you. For who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as
incongruously organized as ours, 'Perhaps some day I shall have to do
with the king's attorney'?"</p>

<p id="id04635">"But can you not say that, sir? The moment you become an inhabitant of<br>

France, you are naturally subjected to the French law."<br></p>

<p id="id04636">"I know it sir," replied Monte Cristo; "but when I visit a country I
begin to study, by all the means which are available, the men from whom
I may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well as,
perhaps better than, they know themselves. It follows from this, that
the king's attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to deal,
would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should."</p>

<p id="id04637">"That is to say," replied Villefort with hesitation, "that human nature
being weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults."</p>

<p id="id04638">"Faults or crimes," responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air.</p>

<p id="id04639">"And that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your
brothers&#8212;for you have said so," observed Villefort in a tone that
faltered somewhat&#8212;"you alone are perfect."</p>

<p id="id04640">"No, not perfect," was the count's reply; "only impenetrable, that's
all. But let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is
displeasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you
by my second-sight."</p>

<p id="id04641">"No, no,&#8212;by no means," said Villefort, who was afraid of seeming
to abandon his ground. "No; by your brilliant and almost sublime
conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no longer
talk, we rise to dissertation. But you know how the theologians in their
collegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies, occasionally
say cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing
in a social way, or even philosophically, and I will say to you, rude
as it may seem, 'My brother, you sacrifice greatly to pride; you may be
above others, but above you there is God.'"</p>

<p id="id04642">"Above us all, sir," was Monte Cristo's response, in a tone and with
an emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered. "I have my
pride for men&#8212;serpents always ready to threaten every one who would
pass without crushing them under foot. But I lay aside that pride before
God, who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am."</p>

<p id="id04643">"Then, count, I admire you," said Villefort, who, for the first time
in this strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the unknown
personage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur. "Yes, and I
say to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious,
or impenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the
same thing&#8212;then be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of
predominance. Yet you have unquestionably some ambition."</p>

<p id="id04644">"I have, sir."</p>

<p id="id04645">"And what may it be?"</p>

<p id="id04646">"I too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by
Satan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed
me all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to
me, 'Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?' I
reflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and then
I replied, 'Listen,&#8212;I have always heard of providence, and yet I have
never seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make me
believe that he exists. I wish to be providence myself, for I feel that
the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is
to recompense and punish.' Satan bowed his head, and groaned. 'You
mistake,' he said, 'providence does exist, only you have never seen him,
because the child of God is as invisible as the parent. You have seen
nothing that resembles him, because he works by secret springs, and
moves by hidden ways. All I can do for you is to make you one of the
agents of that providence.' The bargain was concluded. I may sacrifice
my soul, but what matters it?" added Monte Cristo. "If the thing were
to do again, I would again do it." Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with
extreme amazement. "Count," he inquired, "have you any relations?"</p>

<p id="id04647">"No, sir, I am alone in the world."</p>

<p id="id04648">"So much the worse."</p>

<p id="id04649">"Why?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04650">"Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down
your pride. You say you fear nothing but death?"</p>

<p id="id04651">"I did not say that I feared it; I only said that death alone could
check the execution of my plans."</p>

<p id="id04652">"And old age?"</p>

<p id="id04653">"My end will be achieved before I grow old."</p>

<p id="id04654">"And madness?"</p>

<p id="id04655">"I have been nearly mad; and you know the axiom,&#8212;non bis in idem. It
is an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you understand its full
application."</p>

<p id="id04656">"Sir," continued Villefort, "there is something to fear besides
death, old age, and madness. For instance, there is apoplexy&#8212;that
lightning-stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which
brings everything to an end. You are still yourself as now, and yet you
are yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are
but an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this
is called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than
apoplexy. Come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation
at my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of
understanding and anxious to refute you, and I will show you my father,
M. Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French
Revolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity,
seconded by a most powerful organization&#8212;a man who has not, perhaps,
like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to
overturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself,
like you, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of
providence, but of fate. Well, sir, the rupture of a blood-vessel on the
lobe of the brain has destroyed all this, not in a day, not in an hour,
but in a second. M. Noirtier, who, on the previous night, was the old
Jacobin, the old senator, the old Carbonaro, laughing at the guillotine,
the cannon, and the dagger&#8212;M. Noirtier, playing with revolutions&#8212;M.
Noirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from which pawns,
rooks, knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the king was
checkmated&#8212;M. Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning 'poor M.
Noirtier,' the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the weakest
creature in the household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine; a dumb
and frozen carcass, in fact, living painlessly on, that time may be
given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its
decay."</p>
