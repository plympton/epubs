<p id="id03507">"Gentlemen," said he, "although a companion is agreeable, perfect
freedom is sometimes still more agreeable. I come to say that to-day,
and for the remainder of the Carnival, I leave the carriage entirely at
your disposal. The host will tell you I have three or four more, so that
you will not inconvenience me in any way. Make use of it, I pray you,
for your pleasure or your business."</p>

<p id="id03508">The young men wished to decline, but they could find no good reason for
refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them. The Count of Monte
Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them, conversing on all
subjects with the greatest ease. He was, as we have already said,
perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries. A glance
at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a
connoisseur of pictures. A few words he let fall showed them that he was
no stranger to the sciences, and he seemed much occupied with chemistry.
The two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had
given them; it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for
his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastrini. They told
him so frankly, and he received their excuses with the air of a man who
appreciated their delicacy. Albert was charmed with the count's manners,
and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman
by reason of his varied knowledge. The permission to do what he liked
with the carriage pleased him above all, for the fair peasants had
appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening, and Albert
was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them. At half-past one
they descended, the coachman and footman had put on their livery over
their disguises, which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than
ever, and which gained them the applause of Franz and Albert. Albert
had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button-hole. At the first
sound of the bell they hastened into the Corso by the Via Vittoria. At
the second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, thrown from a carriage filled
with harlequins, indicated to Albert that, like himself and his friend,
the peasants had changed their costume, also; and whether it was the
result of chance, or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both,
while he had changed his costume they had assumed his.</p>

<p id="id03509">Albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button-hole, but he kept the
faded one in his hand; and when he again met the calash, he raised it to
his lips, an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady
who had thrown it, but her joyous companions also. The day was as gay
as the preceding one, perhaps even more animated and noisy; the count
appeared for an instant at his window, but when they again passed he had
disappeared. It is almost needless to say that the flirtation between
Albert and the fair peasant continued all day. In the evening, on his
return, Franz found a letter from the embassy, informing him that he
would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day. At
each previous visit he had made to Rome, he had solicited and obtained
the same favor; and incited as much by a religious feeling as by
gratitude, he was unwilling to quit the capital of the Christian world
without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of St. Peter's
successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues. He did
not then think of the Carnival, for in spite of his condescension and
touching kindness, one cannot incline one's self without awe before the
venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI. On his return from the
Vatican, Franz carefully avoided the Corso; he brought away with him a
treasure of pious thoughts, to which the mad gayety of the maskers
would have been profanation. At ten minutes past five Albert entered
overjoyed. The harlequin had reassumed her peasant's costume, and as
she passed she raised her mask. She was charming. Franz congratulated
Albert, who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious
that they are merited. He had recognized by certain unmistakable signs,
that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy. He had made up his
mind to write to her the next day. Franz remarked, while he gave these
details, that Albert seemed to have something to ask of him, but that he
was unwilling to ask it. He insisted upon it, declaring beforehand
that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished. Albert let
himself be pressed just as long as friendship required, and then avowed
to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy
the carriage alone the next day. Albert attributed to Franz's absence
the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask. Franz
was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of an
adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so
flattering to his vanity. He felt assured that the perfect indiscretion
of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened; and as, during
three years that he had travelled all over Italy, a similar piece of
good fortune had never fallen to his share, Franz was by no means sorry
to learn how to act on such an occasion. He therefore promised Albert
that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival
from the windows of the Rospoli Palace.</p>

<p id="id03510">The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass, holding an enormous
bouquet, which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous
epistle. This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the
bouquet (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a
charming harlequin dressed in rose-colored satin. The evening was no
longer joy, but delirium. Albert nothing doubted but that the fair
unknown would reply in the same manner. Franz anticipated his wishes by
saying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should pass the next day
in writing and looking over his journal. Albert was not deceived, for
the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper
which he held by one corner. "Well," said he, "was I mistaken?"</p>

<p id="id03511">"She has answered you!" cried Franz.</p>

<p id="id03512">"Read." This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe.<br/>

Franz took the letter, and read:&#8212;<br/></p>

<p id="id03513">Tuesday evening, at seven o'clock, descend from your carriage opposite
the Via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your
torch from you. When you arrive at the first step of the church of
San Giacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose-colored ribbons to the
shoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be recognized.
Until then you will not see me.</p>

<p id="id03514">Constancy and Discretion.</p>

<p id="id03515">"Well," asked he, when Franz had finished, "what do you think of that?"</p>

<p id="id03516">"I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance."</p>

<p id="id03517">"I think so, also," replied Albert; "and I very much fear you will go
alone to the Duke of Bracciano's ball." Franz and Albert had received
that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman banker. "Take care,
Albert," said Franz. "All the nobility of Rome will be present, and if
your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society, she must go
there."</p>

<p id="id03518">"Whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same," returned<br/>

Albert. "You have read the letter?"<br/></p>

<p id="id03519">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id03520">"You know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in<br/>

Italy?" (This is the name of the lower class.)<br/></p>

<p id="id03521">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id03522">"Well, read the letter again. Look at the writing, and find if you
can, any blemish in the language or orthography." (The writing was, in
reality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.) "You are born to
good fortune," said Franz, as he returned the letter.</p>

<p id="id03523">"Laugh as much as you will," replied Albert, "I am in love."</p>

<p id="id03524">"You alarm me," cried Franz. "I see that I shall not only go alone to
the Duke of Bracciano's, but also return to Florence alone."</p>

<p id="id03525">"If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful," said Albert, "I shall
fix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least. I adore Rome, and I have
always had a great taste for archaeology."</p>

<p id="id03526">"Come, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of seeing
you a member of the Academy." Doubtless Albert was about to discuss
seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that
dinner was ready. Albert's love had not taken away his appetite. He
hastened with Franz to seat himself, free to recommence the discussion
after dinner. After dinner, the Count of Monte Cristo was announced.
They had not seen him for two days. Signor Pastrini informed them that
business had called him to Civita Vecchia. He had started the previous
evening, and had only returned an hour since. He was charming. Whether
he kept a watch over himself, or whether by accident he did not sound
the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched, he
was to-night like everybody else. The man was an enigma to Franz. The
count must feel sure that Franz recognized him; and yet he had not let
fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them.
On his side, however great Franz's desire was to allude to their former
interview, the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him
and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it. The
count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the
Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let. In consequence, he
brought them the key of his own&#8212;at least such was the apparent motive
of his visit. Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging their fear
of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he was going to
the Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if
they did not profit by it. This assurance determined the two friends to
accept it.</p>

<p id="id03527">Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count's pallor, which had
so forcibly struck him at their first meeting. He could not refrain from
admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or rather
the principal quality of which was the pallor. Truly, a Byronic hero!
Franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him without
imagining his stern head upon Manfred's shoulders, or beneath Lara's
helmet. His forehead was marked with the line that indicates the
constant presence of bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes that seem
to penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful upper lip
that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses
them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed. The count was no
longer young. He was at least forty; and yet it was easy to understand
that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at
present. And, to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of
the English poet, the count seemed to have the power of fascination.
Albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such
a man. Franz was less enthusiastic; but the count exercised over him
also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less
domineering. He thought several times of the project the count had
of visiting Paris; and he had no doubt but that, with his eccentric
character, his characteristic face, and his colossal fortune, he would
produce a great effect there. And yet he did not wish to be at Paris
when the count was there. The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at
Italian theatres; that is, not in listening to the music, but in paying
visits and conversing. The Countess G&#8212;&#8212; wished to revive the subject of
the count, but Franz announced he had something far newer to tell her,
and, in spite of Albert's demonstrations of false modesty, he informed
the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last
three days. As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy, if we may
credit travellers, the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity,
but congratulated Albert on his success. They promised, upon separating,
to meet at the Duke of Bracciano's ball, to which all Rome was invited.
The heroine of the bouquet kept her word; she gave Albert no sign of her
existence the morrow or the day after.</p>

<p id="id03528">At length Tuesday came, the last and most tumultuous day of the
Carnival. On Tuesday, the theatres open at ten o'clock in the morning,
as Lent begins after eight at night. On Tuesday, all those who through
want of money, time, or enthusiasm, have not been to see the Carnival
before, mingle in the gayety, and contribute to the noise and
excitement. From two o'clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the
fete, exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and
the pedestrians, who crowded amongst the horses' feet and the carriage
wheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single fight.
The fetes are veritable pleasure days to the Italians. The author of
this history, who has resided five or six years in Italy, does not
recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those
events so common in other countries. Albert was triumphant in his
harlequin costume. A knot of rose-colored ribbons fell from his shoulder
almost to the ground. In order that there might be no confusion, Franz
wore his peasant's costume.</p>

<p id="id03529">As the day advanced, the tumult became greater. There was not on the
pavement, in the carriages, at the windows, a single tongue that was
silent, a single arm that did not move. It was a human storm, made up
of a thunder of cries, and a hail of sweetmeats, flowers, eggs, oranges,
and nosegays. At three o'clock the sound of fireworks, let off on the
Piazza del Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia (heard with difficulty amid
the din and confusion) announced that the races were about to begin. The
races, like the moccoli, are one of the episodes peculiar to the last
days of the Carnival. At the sound of the fireworks the carriages
instantly broke ranks, and retired by the adjacent streets. All these
evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous
rapidity, without the police interfering in the matter. The pedestrians
ranged themselves against the walls; then the trampling of horses and
the clashing of steel were heard. A detachment of carbineers, fifteen
abreast, galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the barberi.
When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia, a second volley of
fireworks was discharged, to announce that the street was clear. Almost
instantly, in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry, seven
or eight horses, excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand
spectators, passed by like lightning. Then the Castle of Saint Angelo
fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won. Immediately,
without any other signal, the carriages moved on, flowing on towards the
Corso, down all the streets, like torrents pent up for a while, which
again flow into the parent river; and the immense stream again continued
its course between its two granite banks.</p>

<p id="id03530">A new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd. The sellers
of moccoletti entered on the scene. The moccoli, or moccoletti, are
candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight, and
which give to each actor in the great final scene of the Carnival two
very serious problems to grapple with,&#8212;first, how to keep his own
moccoletto alight; and secondly, how to extinguish the moccoletti of
others. The moccoletto is like life: man has found but one means of
transmitting it, and that one comes from God. But he has discovered a
thousand means of taking it away, and the devil has somewhat aided him.
The moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light. But who can
describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto?&#8212;the
gigantic bellows, the monstrous extinguishers, the superhuman fans.
Every one hastened to purchase moccoletti&#8212;Franz and Albert among the
rest.</p>

<p id="id03531">The night was rapidly approaching; and already, at the cry of
"Moccoletti!" repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors, two
or three stars began to burn among the crowd. It was a signal. At the
end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered, descending from
the Palazzo di Venezia to the Piazza del Popolo, and mounting from the
Piazzo del Popolo to the Palazzo di Venezia. It seemed like the fete of
jack-o'-lanterns. It is impossible to form any idea of it without having
seen it. Suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and
mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth; the whole accompanied
by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world. The
facchino follows the prince, the Transteverin the citizen, every one
blowing, extinguishing, relighting. Had old AEolus appeared at this
moment, he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli, and Aquilo
the heir-presumptive to the throne. This battle of folly and flame
continued for two hours; the Corso was light as day; the features of
the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible. Every five
minutes Albert took out his watch; at length it pointed to seven. The
two friends were in the Via dei Pontefici. Albert sprang out, bearing
his moccoletto in his hand. Two or three masks strove to knock his
moccoletto out of his hand; but Albert, a first-rate pugilist, sent them
rolling in the street, one after the other, and continued his course
towards the church of San Giacomo. The steps were crowded with masks,
who strove to snatch each other's torches. Franz followed Albert with
his eyes, and saw him mount the first step. Instantly a mask, wearing
the well-known costume of a peasant woman, snatched his moccoletto from
him without his offering any resistance. Franz was too far off to hear
what they said; but, without doubt, nothing hostile passed, for he saw
Albert disappear arm-in-arm with the peasant girl. He watched them pass
through the crowd for some time, but at length he lost sight of them in
the Via Macello. Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of
the carnival sounded, and at the same instant all the moccoletti were
extinguished as if by enchantment. It seemed as though one immense blast
of the wind had extinguished every one. Franz found himself in utter
darkness. No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were
carrying the maskers home; nothing was visible save a few lights that
burnt behind the windows. The Carnival was over.</p>

<h2 id="id03532" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.</h2>

<p id="id03533">In his whole life, perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so sudden
an impression, so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as in this
moment. It seemed as though Rome, under the magic breath of some demon
of the night, had suddenly changed into a vast tomb. By a chance, which
added yet more to the intensity of the darkness, the moon, which was on
the wane, did not rise until eleven o'clock, and the streets which the
young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity. The distance
was short, and at the end of ten minutes his carriage, or rather the
count's, stopped before the Hotel de Londres. Dinner was waiting, but
as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon, Franz sat down
without him. Signor Pastrini, who had been accustomed to see them dine
together, inquired into the cause of his absence, but Franz merely
replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation
which he had accepted. The sudden extinction of the moccoletti, the
darkness which had replaced the light, and the silence which had
succeeded the turmoil, had left in Franz's mind a certain depression
which was not free from uneasiness. He therefore dined very silently, in
spite of the officious attention of his host, who presented himself two
or three times to inquire if he wanted anything.</p>

<p id="id03534">Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible. He ordered the
carriage, therefore, for eleven o'clock, desiring Signor Pastrini to
inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel. At eleven
o'clock Albert had not come back. Franz dressed himself, and went out,
telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the Duke of
Bracciano's. The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the most
delightful in Rome, the duchess, one of the last heiresses of the
Colonnas, does its honors with the most consummate grace, and thus their
fetes have a European celebrity. Franz and Albert had brought to Rome
letters of introduction to them, and their first question on his arrival
was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion. Franz
replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish
the moccoli, and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Macello. "Then
he has not returned?" said the duke.</p>

<p id="id03535">"I waited for him until this hour," replied Franz.</p>

<p id="id03536">"And do you know whither he went?"</p>

<p id="id03537">"No, not precisely; however, I think it was something very like a
rendezvous."</p>

<p id="id03538">"Diavolo!" said the duke, "this is a bad day, or rather a bad night,
to be out late; is it not, countess!" These words were addressed to
the Countess G&#8212;&#8212;, who had just arrived, and was leaning on the arm of
Signor Torlonia, the duke's brother.</p>

<p id="id03539">"I think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night," replied the
countess, "and those who are here will complain of but one thing&#8212;its
too rapid flight."</p>

<p id="id03540">"I am not speaking," said the duke with a smile, "of the persons who are
here; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with
you, and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely; I
meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome."</p>

<p id="id03541">"Ah," asked the countess, "who is out in the streets of Rome at this
hour, unless it be to go to a ball?"</p>

<p id="id03542">"Our friend, Albert de Morcerf, countess, whom I left in pursuit of his
unknown about seven o'clock this evening," said Franz, "and whom I have
not seen since."</p>

<p id="id03543">"And don't you know where he is?"</p>

<p id="id03544">"Not at all."</p>

<p id="id03545">"Is he armed?"</p>

<p id="id03546">"He is in masquerade."</p>

<p id="id03547">"You should not have allowed him to go," said the duke to Franz; "you,
who know Rome better than he does."</p>

<p id="id03548">"You might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi, who
gained the prize in the race to-day," replied Franz; "and then moreover,
what could happen to him?"</p>

<p id="id03549">"Who can tell? The night is gloomy, and the Tiber is very near the Via
Macello." Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that
the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his
own personal disquietude. "I informed them at the hotel that I had the
honor of passing the night here, duke," said Franz, "and desired them to
come and inform me of his return."</p>

<p id="id03550">"Ah," replied the duke, "here I think, is one of my servants who is
seeking you."</p>

<p id="id03551">The duke was not mistaken; when he saw Franz, the servant came up to
him. "Your excellency," he said, "the master of the Hotel de Londres has
sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from
the Viscount of Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id03552">"A letter from the viscount!" exclaimed Franz.</p>

<p id="id03553">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id03554">"And who is the man?"</p>

<p id="id03555">"I do not know."</p>

<p id="id03556">"Why did he not bring it to me here?"</p>

<p id="id03557">"The messenger did not say."</p>

<p id="id03558">"And where is the messenger?"</p>

<p id="id03559">"He went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you."</p>

<p id="id03560">"Oh," said the countess to Franz, "go with all speed&#8212;poor young man!<br/>

Perhaps some accident has happened to him."<br/></p>

<p id="id03561">"I will hasten," replied Franz.</p>

<p id="id03562">"Shall we see you again to give us any information?" inquired the
countess.</p>

<p id="id03563">"Yes, if it is not any serious affair, otherwise I cannot answer as to
what I may do myself."</p>

<p id="id03564">"Be prudent, in any event," said the countess.</p>

<p id="id03565">"Oh, pray be assured of that." Franz took his hat and went away in
haste. He had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at
two o'clock; fortunately the Palazzo Bracciano, which is on one side
in the Corso, and on the other in the Square of the Holy Apostles, is
hardly ten minutes' walk from the Hotel de Londres. As he came near the
hotel, Franz saw a man in the middle of the street. He had no doubt
that it was the messenger from Albert. The man was wrapped up in a large
cloak. He went up to him, but, to his extreme astonishment, the stranger
first addressed him. "What wants your excellency of me?" inquired the
man, retreating a step or two, as if to keep on his guard.</p>

<p id="id03566">"Are not you the person who brought me a letter," inquired Franz, "from
the Viscount of Morcerf?"</p>

<p id="id03567">"Your excellency lodges at Pastrini's hotel?"</p>

<p id="id03568">"I do."</p>

<p id="id03569">"Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?"</p>

<p id="id03570">"I am."</p>

<p id="id03571">"Your excellency's name"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id03572">"Is the Baron Franz d'Epinay."</p>

<p id="id03573">"Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed."</p>

<p id="id03574">"Is there any answer?" inquired Franz, taking the letter from him.</p>

<p id="id03575">"Yes&#8212;your friend at least hopes so."</p>

<p id="id03576">"Come up-stairs with me, and I will give it to you."</p>

<p id="id03577">"I prefer waiting here," said the messenger, with a smile.</p>

<p id="id03578">"And why?"</p>

<p id="id03579">"Your excellency will know when you have read the letter."</p>

<p id="id03580">"Shall I find you here, then?"</p>

<p id="id03581">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id03582">Franz entered the hotel. On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini.<br/>

"Well?" said the landlord.<br/></p>

<p id="id03583">"Well&#8212;what?" responded Franz.</p>

<p id="id03584">"You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend?"
he asked of Franz.</p>

<p id="id03585">"Yes, I have seen him," he replied, "and he has handed this letter to
me. Light the candles in my apartment, if you please." The inn-keeper
gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light. The young man
had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed, and this had
only made him the more anxious to read Albert's letter; and so he went
instantly towards the waxlight, and unfolded it. It was written and
signed by Albert. Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it
contained. It was thus worded:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id03586">My Dear Fellow,&#8212;The moment you have received this, have the kindness
to take the letter of credit from my pocket-book, which you will find
in the square drawer of the secretary; add your own to it, if it be
not sufficient. Run to Torlonia, draw from him instantly four thousand
piastres, and give them to the bearer. It is urgent that I should have
this money without delay. I do not say more, relying on you as you may
rely on me. Your friend,</p>

<p id="id03587">Albert de Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id03588">P.S.&#8212;I now believe in Italian banditti.</p>

<p id="id03589">Below these lines were written, in a strange hand, the following in<br/>

Italian:&#8212;<br/></p>

<p id="id03590">Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mile piastre non sono nelle mie
mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avra cessato di vivere.</p>

<p id="id03591">Luigi Vampa.</p>

<p id="id03592">"If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my
hands, by seven o'clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live."</p>

<p id="id03593">This second signature explained everything to Franz, who now understood
the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the
street was safer for him. Albert, then, had fallen into the hands of
the famous bandit chief, in whose existence he had for so long a time
refused to believe. There was no time to lose. He hastened to open the
secretary, and found the pocket-book in the drawer, and in it the letter
of credit. There were in all six thousand piastres, but of these six
thousand Albert had already expended three thousand. As to Franz, he had
no letter of credit, as he lived at Florence, and had only come to Rome
to pass seven or eight days; he had brought but a hundred louis, and
of these he had not more than fifty left. Thus seven or eight hundred
piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert
required. True, he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor
Torlonia. He was, therefore, about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano
without loss of time, when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind. He
remembered the Count of Monte Cristo. Franz was about to ring for Signor
Pastrini, when that worthy presented himself. "My dear sir," he said,
hastily, "do you know if the count is within?"</p>

<p id="id03594">"Yes, your excellency; he has this moment returned."</p>

<p id="id03595">"Is he in bed?"</p>

<p id="id03596">"I should say no."</p>

<p id="id03597">"Then ring at his door, if you please, and request him to be so kind
as to give me an audience." Signor Pastrini did as he was desired,
and returning five minutes after, he said,&#8212;"The count awaits your
excellency." Franz went along the corridor, and a servant introduced him
to the count. He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen, and
which was surrounded with divans. The count came towards him. "Well,
what good wind blows you hither at this hour?" said he; "have you come
to sup with me? It would be very kind of you."</p>

<p id="id03598">"No; I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter."</p>

<p id="id03599">"A serious matter," said the count, looking at Franz with the
earnestness usual to him; "and what may it be?"</p>

<p id="id03600">"Are we alone?"</p>

<p id="id03601">"Yes," replied the count, going to the door, and returning. Franz gave
him Albert's letter. "Read that," he said. The count read it.</p>

<p id="id03602">"Well, well!" said he.</p>

<p id="id03603">"Did you see the postscript?"</p>

<p id="id03604">"I did, indeed.</p>

<p id="id03605">"'Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mile piastre non sono nelle mie
mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avra cessato di vivere.</p>

<p id="id03606">"'Luigi Vampa.'"</p>

<p id="id03607">"What think you of that?" inquired Franz.</p>

<p id="id03608">"Have you the money he demands?"</p>

<p id="id03609">"Yes, all but eight hundred piastres." The count went to his secretary,
opened it, and pulling out a drawer filled with gold, said to Franz,&#8212;"I
hope you will not offend me by applying to any one but myself."</p>

<p id="id03610">"You see, on the contrary, I come to you first and instantly," replied<br/>

Franz.<br/></p>

<p id="id03611">"And I thank you; have what you will;" and he made a sign to Franz to
take what he pleased.</p>

<p id="id03612">"Is it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?"
asked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count.</p>

<p id="id03613">"Judge for yourself," replied he. "The postscript is explicit."</p>

<p id="id03614">"I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could
find a way of simplifying the negotiation," said Franz.</p>

<p id="id03615">"How so?" returned the count, with surprise.</p>

<p id="id03616">"If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa, I am sure he would not refuse
you Albert's freedom."</p>

<p id="id03617">"What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?"</p>

<p id="id03618">"Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?"</p>

<p id="id03619">"What is that?"</p>

<p id="id03620">"Have you not saved Peppino's life?"</p>

<p id="id03621">"Well, well," said the count, "who told you that?"</p>

<p id="id03622">"No matter; I know it." The count knit his brows, and remained silent an
instant. "And if I went to seek Vampa, would you accompany me?"</p>

<p id="id03623">"If my society would not be disagreeable."</p>

<p id="id03624">"Be it so. It is a lovely night, and a walk without Rome will do us both
good."</p>

<p id="id03625">"Shall I take any arms?"</p>

<p id="id03626">"For what purpose?"</p>

<p id="id03627">"Any money?"</p>

<p id="id03628">"It is useless. Where is the man who brought the letter?"</p>

<p id="id03629">"In the street."</p>

<p id="id03630">"He awaits the answer?"</p>

<p id="id03631">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id03632">"I must learn where we are going. I will summon him hither."</p>

<p id="id03633">"It is useless; he would not come up."</p>

<p id="id03634">"To your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at
entering mine." The count went to the window of the apartment that
looked on to the street, and whistled in a peculiar manner. The man in
the mantle quitted the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street.
"Salite!" said the count, in the same tone in which he would have
given an order to his servant. The messenger obeyed without the least
hesitation, but rather with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a
bound, entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of
the room. "Ah, it is you, Peppino," said the count. But Peppino, instead
of answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the count's hand,
and covered it with kisses. "Ah," said the count, "you have, then, not
forgotten that I saved your life; that is strange, for it is a week
ago."</p>

<p id="id03635">"No, excellency; and never shall I forget it," returned Peppino, with an
accent of profound gratitude.</p>

<p id="id03636">"Never? That is a long time; but it is something that you believe so.
Rise and answer." Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz. "Oh, you may speak
before his excellency," said he; "he is one of my friends. You allow me
to give you this title?" continued the count in French, "it is necessary
to excite this man's confidence."</p>

<p id="id03637">"You can speak before me," said Franz; "I am a friend of the count's."</p>

<p id="id03638">"Good!" returned Peppino. "I am ready to answer any questions your
excellency may address to me."</p>

<p id="id03639">"How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigi's hands?"</p>

<p id="id03640">"Excellency, the Frenchman's carriage passed several times the one in
which was Teresa."</p>

<p id="id03641">"The chief's mistress?"</p>

<p id="id03642">"Yes. The Frenchman threw her a bouquet; Teresa returned it&#8212;all this
with the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage."</p>

<p id="id03643">"What?" cried Franz, "was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman
peasants?"</p>

<p id="id03644">"It was he who drove, disguised as the coachman," replied Peppino.</p>

<p id="id03645">"Well?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id03646">"Well, then, the Frenchman took off his mask; Teresa, with the chief's
consent, did the same. The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous; Teresa gave
him one&#8212;only, instead of Teresa, it was Beppo who was on the steps of
the church of San Giacomo."</p>

<p id="id03647">"What!" exclaimed Franz, "the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto
from him"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id03648">"Was a lad of fifteen," replied Peppino. "But it was no disgrace to your
friend to have been deceived; Beppo has taken in plenty of others."</p>

<p id="id03649">"And Beppo led him outside the walls?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id03650">"Exactly so; a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello. Beppo
got in, inviting the Frenchman to follow him, and he did not wait to be
asked twice. He gallantly offered the right-hand seat to Beppo, and sat
by him. Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from
Rome; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the
world. The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paola;
and when they were two hundred yards outside, as the Frenchman became
somewhat too forward, Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head, the
coachman pulled up and did the same. At the same time, four of the band,
who were concealed on the banks of the Almo, surrounded the carriage.
The Frenchman made some resistance, and nearly strangled Beppo; but he
could not resist five armed men, and was forced to yield. They made
him get out, walk along the banks of the river, and then brought him
to Teresa and Luigi, who were waiting for him in the catacombs of St.
Sebastian."</p>

<p id="id03651">"Well," said the count, turning towards Franz, "it seems to me that this
is a very likely story. What do you say to it?"</p>

<p id="id03652">"Why, that I should think it very amusing," replied Franz, "if it had
happened to any one but poor Albert."</p>

<p id="id03653">"And, in truth, if you had not found me here," said the count, "it might
have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear;
but now, be assured, his alarm will be the only serious consequence."</p>

<p id="id03654">"And shall we go and find him?" inquired Franz.</p>

<p id="id03655">"Oh, decidedly, sir. He is in a very picturesque place&#8212;do you know the
catacombs of St. Sebastian?"</p>

<p id="id03656">"I was never in them; but I have often resolved to visit them."</p>

<p id="id03657">"Well, here is an opportunity made to your hand, and it would be
difficult to contrive a better. Have you a carriage?"</p>

<p id="id03658">"No."</p>

<p id="id03659">"That is of no consequence; I always have one ready, day and night."</p>

<p id="id03660">"Always ready?"</p>

<p id="id03661">"Yes. I am a very capricious being, and I should tell you that sometimes
when I rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the night, I
resolve on starting for some particular point, and away I go." The count
rang, and a footman appeared. "Order out the carriage," he said, "and
remove the pistols which are in the holsters. You need not awaken the
coachman; Ali will drive." In a very short time the noise of wheels
was heard, and the carriage stopped at the door. The count took out his
watch. "Half-past twelve," he said. "We might start at five o'clock and
be in time, but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night,
and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the
hands of the infidels. Are you still resolved to accompany me?"</p>

<p id="id03662">"More determined than ever."</p>

<p id="id03663">"Well, then, come along."</p>

<p id="id03664">Franz and the count went downstairs, accompanied by Peppino. At the door
they found the carriage. Ali was on the box, in whom Franz recognized
the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo. Franz and the count got
into the carriage. Peppino placed himself beside Ali, and they set off
at a rapid pace. Ali had received his instructions, and went down the
Corso, crossed the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San Gregorio,
and reached the gates of St. Sebastian. Then the porter raised some
difficulties, but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the
governor of Rome, allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of
the day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised, the porter had
a louis for his trouble, and they went on their way. The road which the
carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way, and bordered with
tombs. From time to time, by the light of the moon, which began to rise,
Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various
points among the ruins, and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a
signal from Peppino. A short time before they reached the Baths of
Caracalla the carriage stopped, Peppino opened the door, and the count
and Franz alighted.</p>

<p id="id03665">"In ten minutes," said the count to his companion, "we shall be there."</p>

<p id="id03666">He then took Peppino aside, gave him an order in a low voice, and
Peppino went away, taking with him a torch, brought with them in the
carriage. Five minutes elapsed, during which Franz saw the shepherd
going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface
of the Campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall
red herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion.
"Now," said the count, "let us follow him." Franz and the count in their
turn then advanced along the same path, which, at the distance of
a hundred paces, led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small
valley. They then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity. "Ought
we to go on?" asked Franz of the count; "or shall we wait awhile?"</p>

<p id="id03667">"Let us go on; Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming." One
of the two men was Peppino, and the other a bandit on the lookout. Franz
and the count advanced, and the bandit saluted them. "Your excellency,"
said Peppino, addressing the count, "if you will follow me, the opening
of the catacombs is close at hand."</p>

<p id="id03668">"Go on, then," replied the count. They came to an opening behind a clump
of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks, by which a man could
scarcely pass. Peppino glided first into this crevice; after they got
along a few paces the passage widened. Peppino passed, lighted his
torch, and turned to see if they came after him. The count first reached
an open space and Franz followed him closely. The passageway sloped in
a gentle descent, enlarging as they proceeded; still Franz and the count
were compelled to advance in a stooping posture, and were scarcely able
to proceed abreast of one another. They went on a hundred and fifty
paces in this way, and then were stopped by, "Who comes there?" At the
same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel.</p>

<p id="id03669">"A friend!" responded Peppino; and, advancing alone towards the sentry,
he said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he, like the first,
saluted the nocturnal visitors, making a sign that they might proceed.</p>

<p id="id03670">Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps. Franz and the
count descended these, and found themselves in a mortuary chamber. Five
corridors diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls, dug into
niches, which were arranged one above the other in the shape of
coffins, showed that they were at last in the catacombs. Down one of the
corridors, whose extent it was impossible to determine, rays of light
were visible. The count laid his hand on Franz's shoulder. "Would you
like to see a camp of bandits in repose?" he inquired.</p>

<p id="id03671">"Exceedingly," replied Franz.</p>

<p id="id03672">"Come with me, then. Peppino, put out the torch." Peppino obeyed, and
Franz and the count were in utter darkness, except that fifty paces in
advance of them a reddish glare, more evident since Peppino had put out
his torch, was visible along the wall. They advanced silently, the count
guiding Franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark.
Franz himself, however, saw his way more plainly in proportion as he
went on towards the light, which served in some manner as a guide. Three
arcades were before them, and the middle one was used as a door. These
arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz
were, and on the other into a large square chamber, entirely surrounded
by niches similar to those of which we have spoken. In the midst of this
chamber were four stones, which had formerly served as an altar, as was
evident from the cross which still surmounted them. A lamp, placed at
the base of a pillar, lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the
singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors
concealed in the shadow. A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the
column, and was reading with his back turned to the arcades, through the
openings of which the new-comers contemplated him. This was the chief
of the band, Luigi Vampa. Around him, and in groups, according to their
fancy, lying in their mantles, or with their backs against a sort of
stone bench, which went all round the columbarium, were to be seen
twenty brigands or more, each having his carbine within reach. At the
other end, silent, scarcely visible, and like a shadow, was a
sentinel, who was walking up and down before a grotto, which was only
distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than
elsewhere. When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this
picturesque tableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be
silent, and, ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of
the columbarium, entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced
towards Vampa, who was so intent on the book before him that he did not
hear the noise of his footsteps.</p>

<p id="id03673">"Who comes there?" cried the sentinel, who was less abstracted, and who
saw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief. At this challenge,
Vampa rose quickly, drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle.
In a moment all the bandits were on their feet, and twenty carbines were
levelled at the count. "Well," said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no
muscle of his countenance disturbed, "well, my dear Vampa, it appears to
me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony."</p>

<p id="id03674">"Ground arms," exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of the hand,
while with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then, turning to
the singular personage who had caused this scene, he said, "Your pardon,
your excellency, but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit,
that I did not really recognize you."</p>

<p id="id03675">"It seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa," said
the count, "and that not only do you forget people's faces, but also the
conditions you make with them."</p>

<p id="id03676">"What conditions have I forgotten, your excellency?" inquired the
bandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is anxious
to repair it.</p>

<p id="id03677">"Was it not agreed," asked the count, "that not only my person, but also
that of my friends, should be respected by you?"</p>

<p id="id03678">"And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?"</p>

<p id="id03679">"You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Vicomte
Albert de Morcerf. Well," continued the count, in a tone that made
Franz shudder, "this young gentleman is one of my friends&#8212;this young
gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself&#8212;this young gentleman has
been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and
yet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him hither,
and," added the count, taking the letter from his pocket, "you have set
a ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger."</p>

<p id="id03680">"Why did you not tell me all this&#8212;you?" inquired the brigand chief,
turning towards his men, who all retreated before his look. "Why have
you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the
count, who has all our lives in his hands? By heavens, if I thought one
of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency, I
would blow his brains out with my own hand!"</p>

<p id="id03681">"Well," said the count, turning towards Franz, "I told you there was
some mistake in this."</p>

<p id="id03682">"Are you not alone?" asked Vampa with uneasiness.</p>

<p id="id03683">"I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom
I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word. Come, your
excellency," the count added, turning to Franz, "here is Luigi Vampa,
who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has
committed." Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet
him. "Welcome among us, your excellency," he said to him; "you heard
what the count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would
not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend's
ransom, that this had happened."</p>

<p id="id03684">"But," said Franz, looking round him uneasily, "where is the<br/>

Viscount?&#8212;I do not see him."<br/></p>

<p id="id03685">"Nothing has happened to him, I hope," said the count frowningly.</p>

<p id="id03686">"The prisoner is there," replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow space in
front of which the bandit was on guard, "and I will go myself and tell
him he is free." The chief went towards the place he had pointed out
as Albert's prison, and Franz and the count followed him. "What is the
prisoner doing?" inquired Vampa of the sentinel.</p>

<p id="id03687">"Ma foi, captain," replied the sentry, "I do not know; for the last hour<br/>

I have not heard him stir."<br/></p>

<p id="id03688">"Come in, your excellency," said Vampa. The count and Franz ascended
seven or eight steps after the chief, who drew back a bolt and opened
a door. Then, by the gleam of a lamp, similar to that which lighted the
columbarium, Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of
the bandits had lent him, lying in a corner in profound slumber. "Come,"
said the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile, "not so bad for a
man who is to be shot at seven o'clock to-morrow morning." Vampa looked
at Albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible to such a
proof of courage.</p>

<p id="id03689">"You are right, your excellency," he said; "this must be one of your
friends." Then going to Albert, he touched him on the shoulder, saying,
"Will your excellency please to awaken?" Albert stretched out his arms,
rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes. "Oh," said he, "is it you,
captain? You should have allowed me to sleep. I had such a delightful
dream. I was dancing the galop at Torlonia's with the Countess G&#8212;&#8212;."
Then he drew his watch from his pocket, that he might see how time sped.</p>

<p id="id03690">"Half-past one only?" said he. "Why the devil do you rouse me at this
hour?"</p>

<p id="id03691">"To tell you that you are free, your excellency."</p>

<p id="id03692">"My dear fellow," replied Albert, with perfect ease of mind, "remember,
for the future, Napoleon's maxim, 'Never awaken me but for bad news;' if
you had let me sleep on, I should have finished my galop, and have been
grateful to you all my life. So, then, they have paid my ransom?"</p>

<p id="id03693">"No, your excellency."</p>

<p id="id03694">"Well, then, how am I free?"</p>

<p id="id03695">"A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you."</p>

<p id="id03696">"Come hither?"</p>

<p id="id03697">"Yes, hither."</p>

<p id="id03698">"Really? Then that person is a most amiable person." Albert looked
around and perceived Franz. "What," said he, "is it you, my dear Franz,
whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?"</p>

<p id="id03699">"No, not I," replied Franz, "but our neighbor, the Count of Monte<br/>

Cristo."<br/></p>

<p id="id03700">"Oh, my dear count," said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat and
wristbands, "you are really most kind, and I hope you will consider
me as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the
carriage, and in the next for this visit," and he put out his hand to
the Count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did
give it. The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently
accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him, and yet here was one
whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered; as for Franz, he was
enchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national honor in
the presence of the bandit. "My dear Albert," he said, "if you will make
haste, we shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlonia's. You
may conclude your interrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to
Signor Luigi, who has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a
gentleman."</p>

<p id="id03701">"You are decidedly right, and we may reach the Palazzo by two o'clock.
Signor Luigi," continued Albert, "is there any formality to fulfil
before I take leave of your excellency?"</p>

<p id="id03702">"None, sir," replied the bandit, "you are as free as air."</p>

<p id="id03703">"Well, then, a happy and merry life to you. Come, gentlemen, come."</p>

<p id="id03704">And Albert, followed by Franz and the count, descended the staircase,
crossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand.
"Peppino," said the brigand chief, "give me the torch."</p>

<p id="id03705">"What are you going to do?" inquired the count.</p>

<p id="id03706">"I will show you the way back myself," said the captain; "that is
the least honor that I can render to your excellency." And taking the
lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman, he preceded his guests,
not as a servant who performs an act of civility, but like a king who
precedes ambassadors. On reaching the door, he bowed. "And now, your
excellency," added he, "allow me to repeat my apologies, and I hope you
will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred."</p>

<p id="id03707">"No, my dear Vampa," replied the count; "besides, you compensate for
your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way, that one almost feels obliged to
you for having committed them."</p>

<p id="id03708">"Gentlemen," added the chief, turning towards the young men, "perhaps
the offer may not appear very tempting to you; but if you should ever
feel inclined to pay me a second visit, wherever I may be, you shall be
welcome." Franz and Albert bowed. The count went out first, then Albert.
Franz paused for a moment. "Has your excellency anything to ask me?"
said Vampa with a smile.</p>

<p id="id03709">"Yes, I have," replied Franz; "I am curious to know what work you were
perusing with so much attention as we entered."</p>

<p id="id03710">"Caesar's 'Commentaries,'" said the bandit, "it is my favorite work."</p>

<p id="id03711">"Well, are you coming?" asked Albert.</p>

<p id="id03712">"Yes," replied Franz, "here I am," and he, in his turn, left the caves.
They advanced to the plain. "Ah, your pardon," said Albert, turning
round; "will you allow me, captain?" And he lighted his cigar at Vampa's
torch. "Now, my dear count," he said, "let us on with all the speed
we may. I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of
Bracciano's." They found the carriage where they had left it. The count
said a word in Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed. It
was just two o'clock by Albert's watch when the two friends entered into
the dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they entered
together, all uneasiness on Albert's account ceased instantly. "Madame,"
said the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the countess, "yesterday
you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; I am rather late in
claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend, whose character
for veracity you well know, and he will assure you the delay arose from
no fault of mine." And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal
for the waltz, Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess, and
disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers. In the meanwhile Franz was
considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte
Cristo at the moment when he had been, in some sort, forced to give his
hand to Albert.</p>

<h2 id="id03713" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 38. The Compact.</h2>

<p id="id03714">The first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following
morning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit
to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked
the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered
could never be too often acknowledged. Franz, who seemed attracted
by some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was
strangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be
exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage
seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection to Albert's
request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a
short delay, the count joined them in the salon. "My dear count," said
Albert, advancing to meet him, "permit me to repeat the poor thanks I
offered last night, and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe
to you will never be effaced from my memory; believe me, as long as I
live, I shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the
prompt and important service you rendered me; and also to remember that
to you I am indebted even for my life."</p>

<p id="id03715">"My very good friend and excellent neighbor," replied the count, with a
smile, "you really exaggerate my trifling exertions. You owe me nothing
but some trifle of 20,000. francs, which you have been saved out of
your travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between
us;&#8212;but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and
unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the perfect
indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take."</p>

<p id="id03716">"Upon my word," said Albert, "I deserve no credit for what I could not
help, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to
let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes
all over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile
even in the face of grim Death himself. All that, however, has nothing
to do with my obligations to you, and I now come to ask you whether, in
my own person, my family, or connections, I can in any way serve you?
My father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin, possesses
considerable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid, and I
unhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my
life is dear, at your disposal."</p>

<p id="id03717">"Monsieur de Morcerf," replied the count, "your offer, far from
surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it in
the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;&#8212;nay, I will
go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a
great favor at your hands."</p>

<p id="id03718">"Oh, pray name it."</p>

<p id="id03719">"I am wholly a stranger to Paris&#8212;it is a city I have never yet seen."</p>

<p id="id03720">"Is it possible," exclaimed Albert, "that you have reached your present
age without visiting the finest capital in the world? I can scarcely
credit it."</p>

<p id="id03721">"Nevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking
that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach
to me in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all
probability, I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty,
as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of
your justly celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have
introduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed
no acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the
idea."</p>

<p id="id03722">"So distinguished an individual as yourself," cried Albert, "could
scarcely have required an introduction."</p>

<p id="id03723">"You are most kind; but as regards myself, I can find no merit I
possess, save that, as a millionaire, I might have become a partner in
the speculations of M. Aguado and M. Rothschild; but as my motive in
travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of
dabbling in stocks, I stayed away till some favorable chance should
present itself of carrying my wish into execution. Your offer, however,
smooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M. de
Morcerf" (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile),
"whether you undertake, upon my arrival in France, to open to me the
doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or
a native of Cochin-China?"</p>

<p id="id03724">"Oh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure," answered Albert; "and so
much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father
summons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear
Franz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing, and
connected with the very cream of Parisian society."</p>

<p id="id03725">"Connected by marriage, you mean," said Franz, laughingly.</p>

<p id="id03726">"Well, never mind how it is," answered Albert, "it comes to the same
thing in the end. Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I shall be
quite a sober, staid father of a family! A most edifying representative
I shall make of all the domestic virtues&#8212;don't you think so? But as
regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, I can only say
that you may command me and mine to any extent you please."</p>

<p id="id03727">"Then it is settled," said the count, "and I give you my solemn
assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize
plans that I have long meditated." Franz did not doubt that these plans
were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the
grotto of Monte Cristo, and while the Count was speaking the young man
watched him closely, hoping to read something of his purpose in his
face, but his countenance was inscrutable especially when, as in the
present case, it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile. "But tell me now,
count," exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so
distinguished a person as Monte Cristo; "tell me truly whether you are
in earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris is merely one of the
chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the
course of our lives, but which, like a house built on the sand, is
liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?"</p>

<p id="id03728">"I pledge you my honor," returned the count, "that I mean to do as I
have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit
Paris."</p>

<p id="id03729">"When do you propose going thither?"</p>

<p id="id03730">"Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?"</p>

<p id="id03731">"Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks' time, that is to say,
as fast as I can get there!"</p>

<p id="id03732">"Nay," said the Count; "I will give you three months ere I join you; you
see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.</p>

<p id="id03733">"And in three months' time," said Albert, "you will be at my house?"</p>

<p id="id03734">"Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?"
inquired the count; "only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my
punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements."</p>

<p id="id03735">"Day for day, hour for hour," said Albert; "that will suit me to a dot."</p>

<p id="id03736">"So be it, then," replied the count, and extending his hand towards a
calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, "to-day is the 21st
of February;" and drawing out his watch, added, "it is exactly half-past
ten o'clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me the 21st of
May at the same hour in the forenoon."</p>

<p id="id03737">"Capital," exclaimed Albert; "your breakfast shall be waiting."</p>

<p id="id03738">"Where do you live?"</p>

<p id="id03739">"No. 27, Rue du Helder."</p>

<p id="id03740">"Have you bachelor's apartments there? I hope my coming will not put you
to any inconvenience."</p>

<p id="id03741">"I reside in my father's house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther
side of the court-yard, entirely separated from the main building."</p>

<p id="id03742">"Quite sufficient," replied the count, as, taking out his tablets,
he wrote down "No. 27, Rue du Helder, 21st May, half-past ten in the
morning."</p>

<p id="id03743">"Now then," said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, "make
yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece will not be more
accurate in marking the time than myself."</p>

<p id="id03744">"Shall I see you again ere my departure?" asked Albert.</p>

<p id="id03745">"That depends; when do you leave?"</p>

<p id="id03746">"To-morrow evening, at five o'clock."</p>

<p id="id03747">"In that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to
Naples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday
morning. And you, baron," pursued the count, addressing Franz, "do you
also depart to-morrow?"</p>

<p id="id03748">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id03749">"For France?"</p>

<p id="id03750">"No, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two."</p>

<p id="id03751">"Then we shall not meet in Paris?"</p>

<p id="id03752">"I fear I shall not have that honor."</p>

<p id="id03753">"Well, since we must part," said the count, holding out a hand to
each of the young men, "allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant
journey." It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact
with that of the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he
shuddered at its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse.
"Let us understand each other," said Albert; "it is agreed&#8212;is it
not?&#8212;that you are to be at No. 27, in the Rue du Helder, on the 21st of
May, at half-past ten in the morning, and your word of honor passed for
your punctuality?"</p>

<p id="id03754">"The 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, Rue du Helder, No.
27," replied the Count. The young men then rose, and bowing to the
count, quitted the room. "What is the matter?" asked Albert of Franz,
when they had returned to their own apartments; "you seem more than
commonly thoughtful."</p>

<p id="id03755">"I will confess to you, Albert," replied Franz, "the count is a very
singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris
fills me with a thousand apprehensions."</p>

<p id="id03756">"My dear fellow," exclaimed Albert, "what can there possibly be in that
to excite uneasiness? Why, you must have lost your senses."</p>

<p id="id03757">"Whether I am in my senses or not," answered Franz, "that is the way I
feel."</p>

<p id="id03758">"Listen to me, Franz," said Albert; "I am glad that the occasion has
presented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed how cold you
are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand, has
always been courtesy itself to us. Have you anything particular against
him?"</p>

<p id="id03759">"Possibly."</p>

<p id="id03760">"Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?"</p>

<p id="id03761">"I have."</p>

<p id="id03762">"And where?"</p>

<p id="id03763">"Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to
tell you?"</p>

<p id="id03764">"I promise."</p>

<p id="id03765">"Upon your honor?"</p>

<p id="id03766">"Upon my honor."</p>

<p id="id03767">"Then listen to me." Franz then related to his friend the history of his
excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of
smugglers there, and the two Corsican bandits with them. He dwelt with
considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had
received from the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment
in the grotto of the "Thousand and One Nights." He recounted, with
circumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of the supper, the
hashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his awakening, there
remained no proof or trace of all these events, save the small
yacht, seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward
Porto-Vecchio. Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the
Colosseum, between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised
to obtain the release of the bandit Peppino,&#8212;an engagement which, as
our readers are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled. At last he arrived
at the adventure of the preceding night, and the embarrassment in which
he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven
hundred piastres to make up the sum required, and finally of his
application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result
that followed. Albert listened with the most profound attention. "Well,"
said he, when Franz had concluded, "what do you find to object to in
all you have related? The count is fond of travelling, and, being rich,
possesses a vessel of his own. Go but to Portsmouth or Southampton, and
you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of
the English as can afford the expense, and have the same liking for this
amusement. Now, by way of having a resting-place during his excursions,
avoiding the wretched cookery&#8212;which has been trying its best to poison
me during the last four months, while you have manfully resisted its
effects for as many years,&#8212;and obtaining a bed on which it is possible
to slumber, Monte Cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode
where you first found him; but, to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan
government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace, and thereby depriving
him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of
capital, he has wisely enough purchased the island, and taken its name.
Just ask yourself, my good fellow, whether there are not many persons of
our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never
in their lives were masters of?"</p>

<p id="id03768">"But," said Franz, "the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his
vessel?"</p>

<p id="id03769">"Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough. Nobody knows better
than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves, but
purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from their
native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no disgrace
or stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go to Corsica,
my first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect,
should be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to find
them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire greatly."</p>

<p id="id03770">"Still," persisted Franz, "I suppose you will allow that such men as
Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than
plunder when they seize your person. How do you explain the influence
the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?"</p>

<p id="id03771">"My good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to that
influence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its source;
therefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws, you
must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in
such a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for my own
idea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for saving me
4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more nor less
than 24,000 livres of our money&#8212;a sum at which, most assuredly, I
should never have been estimated in France, proving most indisputably,"
added Albert with a laugh, "that no prophet is honored in his own
country."</p>

<p id="id03772">"Talking of countries," replied Franz, "of what country is the count,
what is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense fortune,
and what were those events of his early life&#8212;a life as marvellous
as unknown&#8212;that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and
gloomy a misanthropy? Certainly these are questions that, in your place,
I should like to have answered."</p>
