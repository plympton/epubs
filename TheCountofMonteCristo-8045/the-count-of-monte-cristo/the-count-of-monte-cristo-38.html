<h2 id="id10753" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 110. The Indictment.</h2>

<p id="id10754">The judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence;
the jury took their seats; M. de Villefort, the object of unusual
attention, and we had almost said of general admiration, sat in the
arm-chair and cast a tranquil glance around him. Every one looked
with astonishment on that grave and severe face, whose calm expression
personal griefs had been unable to disturb, and the aspect of a man who
was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror.</p>

<p id="id10755">"Gendarmes," said the president, "lead in the accused."</p>

<p id="id10756">At these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes
were turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter.
The door soon opened and the accused appeared. The same impression was
experienced by all present, and no one was deceived by the expression
of his countenance. His features bore no sign of that deep emotion
which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek. His hands,
gracefully placed, one upon his hat, the other in the opening of his
white waistcoat, were not at all tremulous; his eye was calm and even
brilliant. Scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the
whole body of magistrates and assistants; his eye rested longer on the
president, and still more so on the king's attorney. By the side of
Andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence, and
who had been appointed by the court, for Andrea disdained to pay
any attention to those details, to which he appeared to attach no
importance. The lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face
expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the
prisoner.</p>

<p id="id10757">The president called for the indictment, revised as we know, by the
clever and implacable pen of Villefort. During the reading of this,
which was long, the public attention was continually drawn towards
Andrea, who bore the inspection with Spartan unconcern. Villefort had
never been so concise and eloquent. The crime was depicted in the most
vivid colors; the former life of the prisoner, his transformation, a
review of his life from the earliest period, were set forth with all the
talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that
of the procureur. Benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion
before the sentence of the law could be pronounced. Andrea paid no
attention to the successive charges which were brought against him. M.
de Villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no doubt practiced
upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use, in vain
endeavored to make him lower his eyes, notwithstanding the depth and
profundity of his gaze. At length the reading of the indictment was
ended.</p>

<p id="id10758">"Accused," said the president, "your name and surname?" Andrea arose.
"Excuse me, Mr. President," he said, in a clear voice, "but I see you
are going to adopt a course of questions through which I cannot follow
you. I have an idea, which I will explain by and by, of making an
exception to the usual form of accusation. Allow me, then, if you
please, to answer in different order, or I will not do so at all."
The astonished president looked at the jury, who in turn looked at
Villefort. The whole assembly manifested great surprise, but Andrea
appeared quite unmoved. "Your age?" said the president; "will you answer
that question?"</p>

<p id="id10759">"I will answer that question, as well as the rest, Mr. President, but in
its turn."</p>

<p id="id10760">"Your age?" repeated the president.</p>

<p id="id10761">"I am twenty-one years old, or rather I shall be in a few days, as I was
born the night of the 27th of September, 1817." M. de Villefort, who
was busy taking down some notes, raised his head at the mention of this
date. "Where were you born?" continued the president.</p>

<p id="id10762">"At Auteuil, near Paris." M. de Villefort a second time raised his head,
looked at Benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of Medusa, and
became livid. As for Benedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine
cambric pocket-handkerchief. "Your profession?"</p>

<p id="id10763">"First I was a forger," answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; "then I
became a thief, and lately have become an assassin." A murmur, or rather
storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly. The judges
themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury manifested tokens of
disgust for cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion. M. de Villefort
pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at first pale, had become red and
burning; then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost
his senses&#8212;he wanted air.</p>

<p id="id10764">"Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?" asked Benedetto, with his
most ingratiating smile. M. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or
rather threw himself down again upon his chair. "And now, prisoner,
will you consent to tell your name?" said the president. "The brutal
affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes
calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court, both in the name
of morality, and for the respect due to humanity. You appear to consider
this a point of honor, and it may be for this reason, that you have
delayed acknowledging your name. You wished it to be preceded by all
these titles."</p>

<p id="id10765">"It is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my
thoughts," said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner.
"This is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the
questions." The public astonishment had reached its height. There was no
longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused. The audience
felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.</p>

<p id="id10766">"Well," said the president; "your name?"</p>

<p id="id10767">"I cannot tell you my name, since I do not know it; but I know my
father's, and can tell it to you."</p>

<p id="id10768">A painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort; great drops of acrid sweat
fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand.</p>

<p id="id10769">"Repeat your father's name," said the president. Not a whisper, not a
breath, was heard in that vast assembly; every one waited anxiously.</p>

<p id="id10770">"My father is king's attorney," replied Andrea calmly.</p>

<p id="id10771">"King's attorney?" said the president, stupefied, and without noticing
the agitation which spread over the face of M. de Villefort; "king's
attorney?"</p>

<p id="id10772">"Yes; and if you wish to know his name, I will tell it,&#8212;he is named
Villefort." The explosion, which had been so long restrained from a
feeling of respect to the court of justice, now burst forth like thunder
from the breasts of all present; the court itself did not seek to
restrain the feelings of the audience. The exclamations, the insults
addressed to Benedetto, who remained perfectly unconcerned, the
energetic gestures, the movement of the gendarmes, the sneers of the
scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any
disturbance&#8212;all this lasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and
magistrates were able to restore silence. In the midst of this tumult
the voice of the president was heard to exclaim,&#8212;"Are you playing with
justice, accused, and do you dare set your fellow-citizens an example of
disorder which even in these times has never been equalled?"</p>

<p id="id10773">Several persons hurried up to M. de Villefort, who sat half bowed over
in his chair, offering him consolation, encouragement, and protestations
of zeal and sympathy. Order was re-established in the hall, except that
a few people still moved about and whispered to one another. A lady,
it was said, had just fainted; they had supplied her with a
smelling-bottle, and she had recovered. During the scene of tumult,
Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then, leaning
with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most graceful
attitude possible, he said: "Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of
insulting the court, or of making a useless disturbance in the presence
of this honorable assembly. They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I
was born; I answer. They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents
abandoned me. But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one,
I can tell them my father's. Now I repeat, my father is named M. de
Villefort, and I am ready to prove it."</p>

<p id="id10774">There was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the
young man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment
towards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had
changed him into a corpse. "Gentlemen," said Andrea, commanding silence
by his voice and manner; "I owe you the proofs and explanations of what
I have said."</p>

<p id="id10775">"But," said the irritated president, "you called yourself Benedetto,
declared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country."</p>

<p id="id10776">"I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have
just made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have
been the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of
the 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.
de Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I
was born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;
my father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped
me in a napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden,
where he buried me alive."</p>

<p id="id10777">A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of
the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.
"But how have you become acquainted with all these details?" asked the
president.</p>

<p id="id10778">"I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against
my father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had
introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried
me. He was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in
the ground, and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain
some treasure he turned up the ground, and found me still living. The
man carried me to the foundling asylum, where I was registered under the
number 37. Three months afterwards, a woman travelled from Rogliano to
Paris to fetch me, and having claimed me as her son, carried me away.
Thus, you see, though born in Paris, I was brought up in Corsica."</p>

<p id="id10779">There was a moment's silence, during which one could have fancied
the hall empty, so profound was the stillness. "Proceed," said the
president.</p>

<p id="id10780">"Certainly, I might have lived happily amongst those good people, who
adored me, but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which
my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart. I increased in
wickedness till I committed crime. One day when I cursed Providence for
making me so wicked, and ordaining me to such a fate, my adopted father
said to me, 'Do not blaspheme, unhappy child, the crime is that of your
father, not yours,&#8212;of your father, who consigned you to hell if you
died, and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive.' After that I
ceased to blaspheme, but I cursed my father. That is why I have uttered
the words for which you blame me; that is why I have filled this whole
assembly with horror. If I have committed an additional crime, punish
me, but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate
has been sad, bitter, and lamentable, then pity me."</p>

<p id="id10781">"But your mother?" asked the president.</p>

<p id="id10782">"My mother thought me dead; she is not guilty. I did not even wish to
know her name, nor do I know it." Just then a piercing cry, ending in a
sob, burst from the centre of the crowd, who encircled the lady who had
before fainted, and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics. She
was carried out of the hall, the thick veil which concealed her face
dropped off, and Madame Danglars was recognized. Notwithstanding his
shattered nerves, the ringing sensation in his ears, and the madness
which turned his brain, Villefort rose as he perceived her. "The proofs,
the proofs!" said the president; "remember this tissue of horrors must
be supported by the clearest proofs."</p>

<p id="id10783">"The proofs?" said Benedetto, laughing; "do you want proofs?"</p>

<p id="id10784">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id10785">"Well, then, look at M. de Villefort, and then ask me for proofs."</p>

<p id="id10786">Every one turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the
universal gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the
midst of the tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented
with the mark of his nails. The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of
astonishment. "Father," said Benedetto, "I am asked for proofs, do you
wish me to give them?"</p>

<p id="id10787">"No, no, it is useless," stammered M. de Villefort in a hoarse voice;
"no, it is useless!"</p>

<p id="id10788">"How useless?" cried the president, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id10789">"I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight
which crushes me. Gentlemen, I know I am in the hands of an avenging
God! We need no proofs; everything relating to this young man is true."
A dull, gloomy silence, like that which precedes some awful phenomenon
of nature, pervaded the assembly, who shuddered in dismay. "What, M.
de Villefort," cried the president, "do you yield to an hallucination?
What, are you no longer in possession of your senses? This strange,
unexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your reason. Come,
recover."</p>

<p id="id10790">The procureur dropped his head; his teeth chattered like those of a man
under a violent attack of fever, and yet he was deadly pale.</p>

<p id="id10791">"I am in possession of all my senses, sir," he said; "my body alone
suffers, as you may suppose. I acknowledge myself guilty of all the
young man has brought against me, and from this hour hold myself under
the authority of the procureur who will succeed me."</p>

<p id="id10792">And as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered
towards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper.
The whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and
confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which
had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian world.</p>

<p id="id10793">"Well," said Beauchamp, "let them now say that drama is unnatural!"</p>

<p id="id10794">"Ma foi!" said Chateau-Renaud, "I would rather end my career like M.
de Morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared with this
catastrophe."</p>

<p id="id10795">"And moreover, it kills," said Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id10796">"And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter," said Debray.<br>

"She did well to die, poor girl!"<br></p>

<p id="id10797">"The sitting is adjourned, gentlemen," said the president; "fresh
inquiries will be made, and the case will be tried next session by
another magistrate." As for Andrea, who was calm and more interesting
than ever, he left the hall, escorted by gendarmes, who involuntarily
paid him some attention. "Well, what do you think of this, my fine
fellow?" asked Debray of the sergeant-at-arms, slipping a louis into his
hand. "There will be extenuating circumstances," he replied.</p>

<h2 id="id10798" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 111. Expiation.</h2>

<p id="id10799">Notwithstanding the density of the crowd, M. de Villefort saw it open
before him. There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions
that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally
been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe. Many people
have been assassinated in a tumult, but even criminals have rarely
been insulted during trial. Thus Villefort passed through the mass
of spectators and officers of the Palais, and withdrew. Though he had
acknowledged his guilt, he was protected by his grief. There are
some situations which men understand by instinct, but which reason is
powerless to explain; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives
utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow. Those
who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to
an entire poem, and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in
regarding his outburst as sublime.</p>

<p id="id10800">It would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which Villefort
left the Palais. Every pulse beat with feverish excitement, every nerve
was strained, every vein swollen, and every part of his body seemed
to suffer distinctly from the rest, thus multiplying his agony a
thousand-fold. He made his way along the corridors through force of
habit; he threw aside his magisterial robe, not out of deference to
etiquette, but because it was an unbearable burden, a veritable garb
of Nessus, insatiate in torture. Having staggered as far as the Rue
Dauphine, he perceived his carriage, awoke his sleeping coachman by
opening the door himself, threw himself on the cushions, and pointed
towards the Faubourg Saint-Honore; the carriage drove on. The weight of
his fallen fortunes seemed suddenly to crush him; he could not
foresee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future with the
indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency
already familiar. God was still in his heart. "God," he murmured, not
knowing what he said,&#8212;"God&#8212;God!" Behind the event that had overwhelmed
him he saw the hand of God. The carriage rolled rapidly onward.
Villefort, while turning restlessly on the cushions, felt something
press against him. He put out his hand to remove the object; it was
a fan which Madame de Villefort had left in the carriage; this fan
awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning. He
thought of his wife.</p>

<p id="id10801">"Oh!" he exclaimed, as though a redhot iron were piercing his heart.
During the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind;
now another object, not less terrible, suddenly presented itself. His
wife! He had just acted the inexorable judge with her, he had condemned
her to death, and she, crushed by remorse, struck with terror,
covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable
virtue,&#8212;she, a poor, weak woman, without help or the power of defending
herself against his absolute and supreme will,&#8212;she might at that very
moment, perhaps, be preparing to die! An hour had elapsed since her
condemnation; at that moment, doubtless, she was recalling all her
crimes to her memory; she was asking pardon for her sins; perhaps
she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous
husband&#8212;a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death! Villefort
again groaned with anguish and despair. "Ah," he exclaimed, "that woman
became criminal only from associating with me! I carried the infection
of crime with me, and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever,
the cholera, the plague! And yet I have punished her&#8212;I have dared to
tell her&#8212;I have&#8212;'Repent and die!' But no, she must not die; she shall
live, and with me. We will flee from Paris and go as far as the earth
reaches. I told her of the scaffold; oh, heavens, I forgot that it
awaits me also! How could I pronounce that word? Yes, we will fly;
I will confess all to her,&#8212;I will tell her daily that I also have
committed a crime!&#8212;Oh, what an alliance&#8212;the tiger and the serpent;
worthy wife of such as I am! She must live that my infamy may diminish
hers." And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage.</p>

<p id="id10802">"Faster, faster!" he cried, in a tone which electrified the coachman.<br>

The horses, impelled by fear, flew towards the house.<br></p>

<p id="id10803">"Yes, yes," repeated Villefort, as he approached his home&#8212;"yes, that
woman must live; she must repent, and educate my son, the sole survivor,
with the exception of the indestructible old man, of the wreck of
my house. She loves him; it was for his sake she has committed these
crimes. We ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who
loves her child. She will repent, and no one will know that she has been
guilty. The events which have taken place in my house, though they now
occupy the public mind, will be forgotten in time, or if, indeed, a few
enemies should persist in remembering them, why then I will add them to
my list of crimes. What will it signify if one, two, or three more are
added? My wife and child shall escape from this gulf, carrying treasures
with them; she will live and may yet be happy, since her child, in whom
all her love is centred, will be with her. I shall have performed a good
action, and my heart will be lighter." And the procureur breathed more
freely than he had done for some time.</p>

<p id="id10804">The carriage stopped at the door of the house. Villefort leaped out
of the carriage, and saw that his servants were surprised at his early
return; he could read no other expression on their features. Neither of
them spoke to him; they merely stood aside to let him pass by, as usual,
nothing more. As he passed by M. Noirtier's room, he perceived two
figures through the half-open door; but he experienced no curiosity to
know who was visiting his father: anxiety carried him on further.</p>

<p id="id10805">"Come," he said, as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife's room,
"nothing is changed here." He then closed the door of the landing.
"No one must disturb us," he said; "I must speak freely to her, accuse
myself, and say"&#8212;he approached the door, touched the crystal handle,
which yielded to his hand. "Not locked," he cried; "that is well." And
he entered the little room in which Edward slept; for though the child
went to school during the day, his mother could not allow him to be
separated from her at night. With a single glance Villefort's eye
ran through the room. "Not here," he said; "doubtless she is in her
bedroom." He rushed towards the door, found it bolted, and stopped,
shuddering. "Heloise!" he cried. He fancied he heard the sound of a
piece of furniture being removed. "Heloise!" he repeated.</p>

<p id="id10806">"Who is there?" answered the voice of her he sought. He thought that
voice more feeble than usual.</p>

<p id="id10807">"Open the door!" cried Villefort. "Open; it is I." But notwithstanding
this request, notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was
uttered, the door remained closed. Villefort burst it open with a
violent blow. At the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir,
Madame de Villefort was standing erect, pale, her features contracted,
and her eyes glaring horribly. "Heloise, Heloise!" he said, "what is the
matter? Speak!" The young woman extended her stiff white hands towards
him. "It is done, monsieur," she said with a rattling noise which seemed
to tear her throat. "What more do you want?" and she fell full length on
the floor. Villefort ran to her and seized her hand, which convulsively
clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper. Madame de Villefort was
dead. Villefort, maddened with horror, stepped back to the threshhold
of the door, fixing his eyes on the corpse: "My son!" he exclaimed
suddenly, "where is my son?&#8212;Edward, Edward!" and he rushed out of the
room, still crying, "Edward, Edward!" The name was pronounced in such a
tone of anguish that the servants ran up.</p>

<p id="id10808">"Where is my son?" asked Villefort; "let him be removed from the house,
that he may not see"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10809">"Master Edward is not down-stairs, sir," replied the valet.</p>

<p id="id10810">"Then he must be playing in the garden; go and see."</p>

<p id="id10811">"No, sir; Madame de Villefort sent for him half an hour ago; he went
into her room, and has not been down-stairs since." A cold perspiration
burst out on Villefort's brow; his legs trembled, and his thoughts flew
about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch. "In
Madame de Villefort's room?" he murmured and slowly returned, with one
hand wiping his forehead, and with the other supporting himself
against the wall. To enter the room he must again see the body of his
unfortunate wife. To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room
which now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the
silence of the tomb. His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth.</p>

<p id="id10812">"Edward!" he stammered&#8212;"Edward!" The child did not answer. Where, then,
could he be, if he had entered his mother's room and not since returned?
He stepped forward. The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched
across the doorway leading to the room in which Edward must be; those
glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold, and the lips bore the
stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony. Through the open door was
visible a portion of the boudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue
satin couch. Villefort stepped forward two or three paces, and beheld
his child lying&#8212;no doubt asleep&#8212;on the sofa. The unhappy man uttered
an exclamation of joy; a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of
despair and darkness. He had only to step over the corpse, enter the
boudoir, take the child in his arms, and flee far, far away.</p>

<p id="id10813">Villefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto
death, gnashing his teeth in his wound. He no longer feared realities,
but phantoms. He leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning
brazier. He took the child in his arms, embraced him, shook him, called
him, but the child made no response. He pressed his burning lips to the
cheeks, but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs; he
pressed his hand upon the heart, but it no longer beat,&#8212;the child
was dead. A folded paper fell from Edward's breast. Villefort,
thunderstruck, fell upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms, and
rolled on the floor by the side of its mother. He picked up the paper,
and, recognizing his wife's writing, ran his eyes rapidly over its
contents; it ran as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10814">"You know that I was a good mother, since it was for my son's sake I
became criminal. A good mother cannot depart without her son."</p>

<p id="id10815">Villefort could not believe his eyes,&#8212;he could not believe his reason;
he dragged himself towards the child's body, and examined it as a
lioness contemplates its dead cub. Then a piercing cry escaped from his
breast, and he cried, "Still the hand of God." The presence of the
two victims alarmed him; he could not bear solitude shared only by two
corpses. Until then he had been sustained by rage, by his strength of
mind, by despair, by the supreme agony which led the Titans to scale the
heavens, and Ajax to defy the gods. He now arose, his head bowed beneath
the weight of grief, and, shaking his damp, dishevelled hair, he who had
never felt compassion for any one determined to seek his father, that he
might have some one to whom he could relate his misfortunes,&#8212;some one
by whose side he might weep. He descended the little staircase with
which we are acquainted, and entered Noirtier's room. The old man
appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his
infirmities would allow to the Abbe Busoni, who looked cold and calm, as
usual. Villefort, perceiving the abbe, passed his hand across his
brow. He recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at
Auteuil, and then the visit the abbe had himself paid to his house on
the day of Valentine's death. "You here, sir!" he exclaimed; "do you,
then, never appear but to act as an escort to death?"</p>

<p id="id10816">Busoni turned around, and, perceiving the excitement depicted on the
magistrate's face, the savage lustre of his eyes, he understood that
the revelation had been made at the assizes; but beyond this he was
ignorant. "I came to pray over the body of your daughter."</p>

<p id="id10817">"And now why are you here?"</p>

<p id="id10818">"I come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt, and
that from this moment I will pray to God to forgive you, as I do."</p>

<p id="id10819">"Good heavens!" exclaimed Villefort, stepping back fearfully, "surely
that is not the voice of the Abbe Busoni!"</p>

<p id="id10820">"No!" The abbe threw off his wig, shook his head, and his hair, no
longer confined, fell in black masses around his manly face.</p>

<p id="id10821">"It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo!" exclaimed the procureur,
with a haggard expression.</p>

<p id="id10822">"You are not exactly right, M. Procureur; you must go farther back."</p>

<p id="id10823">"That voice, that voice!&#8212;where did I first hear it?"</p>

<p id="id10824">"You heard it for the first time at Marseilles, twenty-three years ago,
the day of your marriage with Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran. Refer to your
papers."</p>

<p id="id10825">"You are not Busoni?&#8212;you are not Monte Cristo? Oh, heavens&#8212;you are,
then, some secret, implacable, and mortal enemy! I must have wronged you
in some way at Marseilles. Oh, woe to me!"</p>

<p id="id10826">"Yes; you are now on the right path," said the count, crossing his arms
over his broad chest; "search&#8212;search!"</p>

<p id="id10827">"But what have I done to you?" exclaimed Villefort, whose mind was
balancing between reason and insanity, in that cloud which is neither a
dream nor reality; "what have I done to you? Tell me, then! Speak!"</p>

<p id="id10828">"You condemned me to a horrible, tedious death; you killed my father;
you deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness."</p>

<p id="id10829">"Who are you, then? Who are you?"</p>

<p id="id10830">"I am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the Chateau
d'If. God gave that spectre the form of the Count of Monte Cristo when
he at length issued from his tomb, enriched him with gold and diamonds,
and led him to you!"</p>

<p id="id10831">"Ah, I recognize you&#8212;I recognize you!" exclaimed the king's attorney;
"you are"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10832">"I am Edmond Dantes!"</p>

<p id="id10833">"You are Edmond Dantes," cried Villefort, seizing the count by the
wrist; "then come here!" And up the stairs he dragged Monte Cristo; who,
ignorant of what had happened, followed him in astonishment, foreseeing
some new catastrophe. "There, Edmond Dantes!" he said, pointing to the
bodies of his wife and child, "see, are you well avenged?" Monte Cristo
became pale at this horrible sight; he felt that he had passed beyond
the bounds of vengeance, and that he could no longer say, "God is for
and with me." With an expression of indescribable anguish he threw
himself upon the body of the child, reopened its eyes, felt its
pulse, and then rushed with him into Valentine's room, of which he
double-locked the door. "My child," cried Villefort, "he carries away
the body of my child! Oh, curses, woe, death to you!" and he tried to
follow Monte Cristo; but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the
spot,&#8212;his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets;
he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with
blood; the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would
burst their narrow boundary, and deluge his brain with living fire.
This lasted several minutes, until the frightful overturn of reason was
accomplished; then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter,
he rushed down the stairs.</p>

<p id="id10834">A quarter of an hour afterwards the door of Valentine's room opened, and
Monte Cristo reappeared. Pale, with a dull eye and heavy heart, all the
noble features of that face, usually so calm and serene, were overcast
by grief. In his arms he held the child, whom no skill had been able to
recall to life. Bending on one knee, he placed it reverently by the side
of its mother, with its head upon her breast. Then, rising, he went
out, and meeting a servant on the stairs, he asked, "Where is M. de
Villefort?"</p>

<p id="id10835">The servant, instead of answering, pointed to the garden. Monte Cristo
ran down the steps, and advancing towards the spot designated beheld
Villefort, encircled by his servants, with a spade in his hand, and
digging the earth with fury. "It is not here!" he cried. "It is not
here!" And then he moved farther on, and began again to dig.</p>

<p id="id10836">Monte Cristo approached him, and said in a low voice, with an expression
almost humble, "Sir, you have indeed lost a son; but"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10837">Villefort interrupted him; he had neither listened nor heard. "Oh, I
will find it," he cried; "you may pretend he is not here, but I will
find him, though I dig forever!" Monte Cristo drew back in horror. "Oh,"
he said, "he is mad!" And as though he feared that the walls of the
accursed house would crumble around him, he rushed into the street, for
the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done.
"Oh, enough of this,&#8212;enough of this," he cried; "let me save the last."
On entering his house, he met Morrel, who wandered about like a ghost
awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb. "Prepare yourself,
Maximilian," he said with a smile; "we leave Paris to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id10838">"Have you nothing more to do there?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id10839">"No," replied Monte Cristo; "God grant I may not have done too much
already."</p>

<p id="id10840">The next day they indeed left, accompanied only by Baptistin. Haidee had
taken away Ali, and Bertuccio remained with Noirtier.</p>

<h2 id="id10841" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 112. The Departure.</h2>

<p id="id10842">The recent event formed the theme of conversation throughout all Paris.
Emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their
little apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three successive, sudden,
and most unexpected catastrophes of Morcerf, Danglars, and Villefort.
Maximilian, who was paying them a visit, listened to their conversation,
or rather was present at it, plunged in his accustomed state of apathy.
"Indeed," said Julie, "might we not almost fancy, Emmanuel, that
those people, so rich, so happy but yesterday, had forgotten in their
prosperity that an evil genius&#8212;like the wicked fairies in Perrault's
stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism&#8212;hovered
over them, and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal
neglect?"</p>

<p id="id10843">"What a dire misfortune!" said Emmanuel, thinking of Morcerf and<br>

Danglars.<br></p>

<p id="id10844">"What dreadful sufferings!" said Julie, remembering Valentine, but whom,
with a delicacy natural to women, she did not name before her brother.</p>

<p id="id10845">"If the Supreme Being has directed the fatal blow," said Emmanuel, "it
must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past
lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment."</p>

<p id="id10846">"Do you not form a very rash judgment, Emmanuel?" said Julie. "When my
father, with a pistol in his hand, was once on the point of committing
suicide, had any one then said, 'This man deserves his misery,' would
not that person have been deceived?"</p>

<p id="id10847">"Yes; but your father was not allowed to fall. A being was commissioned
to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him."</p>

<p id="id10848">Emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell
was heard, the well-known signal given by the porter that a visitor had
arrived. Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count of
Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold. The young people uttered a
cry of joy, while Maximilian raised his head, but let it fall again
immediately. "Maximilian," said the count, without appearing to notice
the different impressions which his presence produced on the little
circle, "I come to seek you."</p>

<p id="id10849">"To seek me?" repeated Morrel, as if awakening from a dream.</p>

<p id="id10850">"Yes," said Monte Cristo; "has it not been agreed that I should take you
with me, and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure?"</p>

<p id="id10851">"I am ready," said Maximilian; "I came expressly to wish them farewell."</p>

<p id="id10852">"Whither are you going, count?" asked Julie.</p>

<p id="id10853">"In the first instance to Marseilles, madame."</p>

<p id="id10854">"To Marseilles!" exclaimed the young couple.</p>

<p id="id10855">"Yes, and I take your brother with me."</p>

<p id="id10856">"Oh, count." said Julie, "will you restore him to us cured of his
melancholy?"&#8212;Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his
countenance.</p>

<p id="id10857">"You perceive, then, that he is not happy?" said the count. "Yes,"
replied the young woman; "and fear much that he finds our home but a
dull one."</p>

<p id="id10858">"I will undertake to divert him," replied the count.</p>

<p id="id10859">"I am ready to accompany you, sir," said Maximilian. "Adieu, my kind
friends! Emmanuel&#8212;Julie&#8212;farewell!"</p>

<p id="id10860">"How farewell?" exclaimed Julie; "do you leave us thus, so suddenly,
without any preparations for your journey, without even a passport?"</p>

<p id="id10861">"Needless delays but increase the grief of parting," said Monte
Cristo, "and Maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything
requisite; at least, I advised him to do so."</p>

<p id="id10862">"I have a passport, and my clothes are ready packed," said Morrel in his
tranquil but mournful manner.</p>

<p id="id10863">"Good," said Monte Cristo, smiling; "in these prompt arrangements we
recognize the order of a well-disciplined soldier."</p>

<p id="id10864">"And you leave us," said Julie, "at a moment's warning? you do not give
us a day&#8212;no, not even an hour before your departure?"</p>

<p id="id10865">"My carriage is at the door, madame, and I must be in Rome in five
days."</p>

<p id="id10866">"But does Maximilian go to Rome?" exclaimed Emmanuel.</p>

<p id="id10867">"I am going wherever it may please the count to take me," said Morrel,
with a smile full of grief; "I am under his orders for the next month."</p>

<p id="id10868">"Oh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!" said Julie.</p>

<p id="id10869">"Maximilian goes with me," said the count, in his kindest and most
persuasive manner; "therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your
brother's account."</p>

<p id="id10870">"Once more farewell, my dear sister; Emmanuel, adieu!" Morrel repeated.</p>

<p id="id10871">"His carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart," said Julie.
"Oh, Maximilian, Maximilian, you are certainly concealing something from
us."</p>

<p id="id10872">"Pshaw!" said Monte Cristo, "you will see him return to you gay,
smiling, and joyful."</p>

<p id="id10873">Maximilian cast a look of disdain, almost of anger, on the count.</p>

<p id="id10874">"We must leave you," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id10875">"Before you quit us, count," said Julie, "will you permit us to express
to you all that the other day"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10876">"Madame," interrupted the count, taking her two hands in his, "all that
you could say in words would never express what I read in your eyes; the
thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine. Like benefactors
in romances, I should have left you without seeing you again, but that
would have been a virtue beyond my strength, because I am a weak
and vain man, fond of the tender, kind, and thankful glances of my
fellow-creatures. On the eve of departure I carry my egotism so far as
to say, 'Do not forget me, my kind friends, for probably you will never
see me again.'"</p>

<p id="id10877">"Never see you again?" exclaimed Emmanuel, while two large tears rolled
down Julie's cheeks, "never behold you again? It is not a man, then, but
some angel that leaves us, and this angel is on the point of returning
to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good."</p>

<p id="id10878">"Say not so," quickly returned Monte Cristo&#8212;"say not so, my friends;
angels never err, celestial beings remain where they wish to be. Fate is
not more powerful than they; it is they who, on the contrary, overcome
fate. No, Emmanuel, I am but a man, and your admiration is as unmerited
as your words are sacrilegious." And pressing his lips on the hand of
Julie, who rushed into his arms, he extended his other hand to Emmanuel;
then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness, he made a
sign to Maximilian, who followed him passively, with the indifference
which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of Valentine had
so stunned him. "Restore my brother to peace and happiness," whispered
Julie to Monte Cristo. And the count pressed her hand in reply, as he
had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to Morrel's study.</p>

<p id="id10879">"You still confide, then, in Sinbad the Sailor?" asked he, smiling.</p>

<p id="id10880">"Oh, yes," was the ready answer.</p>

<p id="id10881">"Well, then, sleep in peace, and put your trust in heaven." As we have
before said, the postchaise was waiting; four powerful horses were
already pawing the ground with impatience, while Ali, apparently just
arrived from a long walk, was standing at the foot of the steps, his
face bathed in perspiration. "Well," asked the count in Arabic, "have
you been to see the old man?" Ali made a sign in the affirmative.</p>

<p id="id10882">"And have you placed the letter before him, as I ordered you to do?"</p>

<p id="id10883">The slave respectfully signalized that he had. "And what did he say, or
rather do?" Ali placed himself in the light, so that his master might
see him distinctly, and then imitating in his intelligent manner the
countenance of the old man, he closed his eyes, as Noirtier was in the
custom of doing when saying "Yes."</p>

<p id="id10884">"Good; he accepts," said Monte Cristo. "Now let us go."</p>

<p id="id10885">These words had scarcely escaped him, when the carriage was on its way,
and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement.
Maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word. Half
an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly; the count had
just pulled the silken check-string, which was fastened to Ali's finger.
The Nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door. It was
a lovely starlight night&#8212;they had just reached the top of the hill
Villejuif, from whence Paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its
millions of phosphoric waves into light&#8212;waves indeed more noisy, more
passionate, more changeable, more furious, more greedy, than those
of the tempestuous ocean,&#8212;waves which never rest as those of the sea
sometimes do,&#8212;waves ever dashing, ever foaming, ever ingulfing what
falls within their grasp. The count stood alone, and at a sign from his
hand, the carriage went on for a short distance. With folded arms, he
gazed for some time upon the great city. When he had fixed his piercing
look on this modern Babylon, which equally engages the contemplation
of the religious enthusiast, the materialist, and the scoffer,&#8212;"Great
city," murmured he, inclining his head, and joining his hands as if in
prayer, "less than six months have elapsed since first I entered thy
gates. I believe that the Spirit of God led my steps to thee and that he
also enables me to quit thee in triumph; the secret cause of my presence
within thy walls I have confided alone to him who only has had the power
to read my heart. God only knows that I retire from thee without pride
or hatred, but not without many regrets; he only knows that the power
confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to
any useless cause. Oh, great city, it is in thy palpitating bosom that
I have found that which I sought; like a patient miner, I have dug
deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence. Now my work is
accomplished, my mission is terminated, now thou canst neither afford me
pain nor pleasure. Adieu, Paris, adieu!"</p>

<p id="id10886">His look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the
night; he passed his hand over his brow, got into the carriage, the door
was closed on him, and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other
side of the hill in a whirlwind of noise and dust.</p>

<p id="id10887">Ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered.</p>

<p id="id10888">Morrel was dreaming, and Monte Cristo was looking at the dreamer.</p>

<p id="id10889">"Morrel," said the count to him at length, "do you repent having
followed me?"</p>

<p id="id10890">"No, count; but to leave Paris"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10891">"If I thought happiness might await you in Paris, Morrel, I would have
left you there."</p>

<p id="id10892">"Valentine reposes within the walls of Paris, and to leave Paris is like
losing her a second time."</p>

<p id="id10893">"Maximilian," said the count, "the friends that we have lost do not
repose in the bosom of the earth, but are buried deep in our hearts, and
it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them. I
have two friends, who in this way never depart from me; the one who gave
me being, and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me.
Their spirits live in me. I consult them when doubtful, and if I ever do
any good, it is due to their beneficent counsels. Listen to the voice
of your heart, Morrel, and ask it whether you ought to preserve this
melancholy exterior towards me."</p>

<p id="id10894">"My friend," said Maximilian, "the voice of my heart is very sorrowful,
and promises me nothing but misfortune."</p>

<p id="id10895">"It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black
cloud. The soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened, and
consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising."</p>

<p id="id10896">"That may possibly be true," said Maximilian, and he again subsided into
his thoughtful mood.</p>

<p id="id10897">The journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the
unlimited power of the count ever commanded. Towns fled from them like
shadows on their path, and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn
seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them, and retreating
as rapidly when once reached. The following morning they arrived at
Chalons, where the count's steamboat waited for them. Without the loss
of an instant, the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers
embarked without delay. The boat was built for speed; her two
paddle-wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like
a bird. Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is
generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air, and the wind
which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point
of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there.</p>

<p id="id10898">As the distance increased between the travellers and Paris, almost
superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count; he might have been
taken for an exile about to revisit his native land. Ere long Marseilles
presented herself to view,&#8212;Marseilles, white, fervid, full of life
and energy,&#8212;Marseilles, the younger sister of Tyre and Carthage, the
successor to them in the empire of the Mediterranean,&#8212;Marseilles, old,
yet always young. Powerful memories were stirred within them by the
sight of the round tower, Fort Saint-Nicolas, the City Hall designed
by Puget, [*] the port with its brick quays, where they had both played
in childhood, and it was with one accord that they stopped on the
Cannebiere. A vessel was setting sail for Algiers, on board of which the
bustle usually attending departure prevailed. The passengers and their
relations crowded on the deck, friends taking a tender but sorrowful
leave of each other, some weeping, others noisy in their grief, the
whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who
witnessed similar sights daily, but which had no power to disturb the
current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of Maximilian
from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay.</p>

<p id="id10899">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;* Pierre Puget, the sculptor-architect, was born at<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marseilles in 1622.<br></p>

<p id="id10900">"Here," said he, leaning heavily on the arm of Monte Cristo,&#8212;"here is
the spot where my father stopped, when the Pharaon entered the port; it
was here that the good old man, whom you saved from death and dishonor,
threw himself into my arms. I yet feel his warm tears on my face, and
his were not the only tears shed, for many who witnessed our meeting
wept also." Monte Cristo gently smiled and said,&#8212;"I was there;" at the
same time pointing to the corner of a street. As he spoke, and in the
very direction he indicated, a groan, expressive of bitter grief, was
heard, and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the
vessel about to sail. Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that
must have been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the
vessel.</p>

<p id="id10901">"Oh, heavens!" exclaimed Morrel, "I do not deceive myself&#8212;that young
man who is waving his hat, that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant, is
Albert de Morcerf!"</p>

<p id="id10902">"Yes," said Monte Cristo, "I recognized him."</p>

<p id="id10903">"How so?&#8212;you were looking the other way." the Count smiled, as he was
in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply, and he
again turned towards the veiled woman, who soon disappeared at the
corner of the street. Turning to his friend,&#8212;"Dear Maximilian," said
the count, "have you nothing to do in this land?"</p>

<p id="id10904">"I have to weep over the grave of my father," replied Morrel in a broken
voice.</p>

<p id="id10905">"Well, then, go,&#8212;wait for me there, and I will soon join you."</p>

<p id="id10906">"You leave me, then?"</p>

<p id="id10907">"Yes; I also have a pious visit to pay."</p>

<p id="id10908">Morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to
him; then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he
quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city. Monte
Cristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight; he
then walked slowly towards the Allees de Meillan to seek out a small
house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this
story. It yet stood, under the shade of the fine avenue of lime-trees,
which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of Marseilles,
covered by an immense vine, which spreads its aged and blackened
branches over the stone front, burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the
south. Two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the
door, which was made of three planks; the door had never been painted or
varnished, so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to
close again when the rains came on. The house, with all its crumbling
antiquity and apparent misery, was yet cheerful and picturesque, and was
the same that old Dantes formerly inhabited&#8212;the only difference being
that the old man occupied merely the garret, while the whole house was
now placed at the command of Mercedes by the count.</p>

<p id="id10909">The woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret
entered this house; she had scarcely closed the door after her when
Monte Cristo appeared at the corner of a street, so that he found and
lost her again almost at the same instant. The worn out steps were old
acquaintances of his; he knew better than any one else how to open that
weather-beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise
the latch within. He entered without knocking, or giving any other
intimation of his presence, as if he had been a friend or the master
of the place. At the end of a passage paved with bricks, was a little
garden, bathed in sunshine, and rich in warmth and light. In this garden
Mercedes had found, at the place indicated by the count, the sum of
money which he, through a sense of delicacy, had described as having
been placed there twenty-four years previously. The trees of the garden
were easily seen from the steps of the street-door. Monte Cristo, on
stepping into the house, heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob; he
looked in the direction whence it came, and there under an arbor of
Virginia jessamine, [*] with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple
flowers, he saw Mercedes seated, with her head bowed, and weeping
bitterly. She had raised her veil, and with her face hidden by her hands
was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long
restrained by the presence of her son. Monte Cristo advanced a few
steps, which were heard on the gravel. Mercedes raised her head, and
uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her.</p>

<p id="id10910" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     * The Carolina&#8212;not Virginia&#8212;jessamine, gelsemium
     sempervirens (properly speaking not a jessamine at all) has
     yellow blossoms. The reference is no doubt to the Wistaria
     frutescens.&#8212;Ed.</p>

<p id="id10911">"Madame," said the count, "it is no longer in my power to restore you to
happiness, but I offer you consolation; will you deign to accept it as
coming from a friend?"</p>

<p id="id10912">"I am, indeed, most wretched," replied Mercedes. "Alone in the world, I
had but my son, and he has left me!"</p>

<p id="id10913">"He possesses a noble heart, madame," replied the count, "and he has
acted rightly. He feels that every man owes a tribute to his country;
some contribute their talents, others their industry; these devote their
blood, those their nightly labors, to the same cause. Had he remained
with you, his life must have become a hateful burden, nor would he have
participated in your griefs. He will increase in strength and honor by
struggling with adversity, which he will convert into prosperity.
Leave him to build up the future for you, and I venture to say you will
confide it to safe hands."</p>

<p id="id10914">"Oh," replied the wretched woman, mournfully shaking her head, "the
prosperity of which you speak, and which, from the bottom of my heart, I
pray God in his mercy to grant him, I can never enjoy. The bitter cup of
adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs, and I feel that the
grave is not far distant. You have acted kindly, count, in bringing me
back to the place where I have enjoyed so much bliss. I ought to meet
death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own."</p>

<p id="id10915">"Alas," said Monte Cristo, "your words sear and embitter my heart, the
more so as you have every reason to hate me. I have been the cause of
all your misfortunes; but why do you pity, instead of blaming me? You
render me still more unhappy"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10916">"Hate you, blame you&#8212;you, Edmond! Hate, reproach, the man that has
spared my son's life! For was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention
to destroy that son of whom M. de Morcerf was so proud? Oh, look at me
closely, and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in
me." The count looked up and fixed his eyes on Mercedes, who arose
partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him. "Oh, look
at me," continued she, with a feeling of profound melancholy, "my eyes
no longer dazzle by their brilliancy, for the time has long fled since I
used to smile on Edmond Dantes, who anxiously looked out for me from
the window of yonder garret, then inhabited by his old father. Years
of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present. I
neither reproach you nor hate you, my friend. Oh, no, Edmond, it is
myself that I blame, myself that I hate! Oh, miserable creature that I
am!" cried she, clasping her hands, and raising her eyes to heaven. "I
once possessed piety, innocence, and love, the three ingredients of the
happiness of angels, and now what am I?" Monte Cristo approached her,
and silently took her hand. "No," said she, withdrawing it gently&#8212;"no,
my friend, touch me not. You have spared me, yet of all those who have
fallen under your vengeance I was the most guilty. They were influenced
by hatred, by avarice, and by self-love; but I was base, and for want
of courage acted against my judgment. Nay, do not press my hand, Edmond;
you are thinking, I am sure, of some kind speech to console me, but do
not utter it to me, reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness.
See" (and she exposed her face completely to view)&#8212;"see, misfortune
has silvered my hair, my eyes have shed so many tears that they are
encircled by a rim of purple, and my brow is wrinkled. You, Edmond, on
the contrary,&#8212;you are still young, handsome, dignified; it is because
you have had faith; because you have had strength, because you have had
trust in God, and God has sustained you. But as for me, I have been a
coward; I have denied God and he has abandoned me."</p>

<p id="id10917">Mercedes burst into tears; her woman's heart was breaking under its load
of memories. Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it; but
she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would
have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint. "It often
happens," continued she, "that a first fault destroys the prospects of a
whole life. I believed you dead; why did I survive you? What good has
it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my
heart?&#8212;only to make a woman of thirty-nine look like a woman of fifty.
Why, having recognized you, and I the only one to do so&#8212;why was I able
to save my son alone? Ought I not also to have rescued the man that I
had accepted for a husband, guilty though he were? Yet I let him die!
What do I say? Oh, merciful heavens, was I not accessory to his death by
my supine insensibility, by my contempt for him, not remembering, or not
willing to remember, that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and
a perjurer? In what am I benefited by accompanying my son so far, since
I now abandon him, and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate
of Africa? Oh, I have been base, cowardly, I tell you; I have abjured
my affections, and like all renegades I am of evil omen to those who
surround me!"</p>

<p id="id10918">"No, Mercedes," said Monte Cristo, "no; you judge yourself with too
much severity. You are a noble-minded woman, and it was your grief
that disarmed me. Still I was but an agent, led on by an invisible and
offended Deity, who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that I was
destined to hurl. I take that God to witness, at whose feet I have
prostrated myself daily for the last ten years, that I would have
sacrificed my life to you, and with my life the projects that were
indissolubly linked with it. But&#8212;and I say it with some pride,
Mercedes&#8212;God needed me, and I lived. Examine the past and the present,
and endeavor to dive into futurity, and then say whether I am not a
divine instrument. The most dreadful misfortunes, the most frightful
sufferings, the abandonment of all those who loved me, the persecution
of those who did not know me, formed the trials of my youth; when
suddenly, from captivity, solitude, misery, I was restored to light
and liberty, and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant,
so unbounded, so unheard-of, that I must have been blind not to be
conscious that God had endowed me with it to work out his own great
designs. From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided
to me for an especial purpose. Not a thought was given to a life which
you once, Mercedes, had the power to render blissful; not one hour
of peaceful calm was mine; but I felt myself driven on like an
exterminating angel. Like adventurous captains about to embark on some
enterprise full of danger, I laid in my provisions, I loaded my weapons,
I collected every means of attack and defence; I inured my body to the
most violent exercises, my soul to the bitterest trials; I taught my
arm to slay, my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings, and my mouth
to smile at the most horrid spectacles. Good-natured, confiding, and
forgiving as I had been, I became revengeful, cunning, and wicked, or
rather, immovable as fate. Then I launched out into the path that was
opened to me. I overcame every obstacle, and reached the goal; but woe
to those who stood in my pathway!"</p>

<p id="id10919">"Enough," said Mercedes; "enough, Edmond! Believe me, that she who alone
recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you; and had she
crossed your path, and you had crushed her like glass, still, Edmond,
still she must have admired you! Like the gulf between me and the past,
there is an abyss between you, Edmond, and the rest of mankind; and I
tell you freely that the comparison I draw between you and other men
will ever be one of my greatest tortures. No, there is nothing in the
world to resemble you in worth and goodness! But we must say farewell,
Edmond, and let us part."</p>

<p id="id10920">"Before I leave you, Mercedes, have you no request to make?" said the
count.</p>

<p id="id10921">"I desire but one thing in this world, Edmond,&#8212;the happiness of my
son."</p>

<p id="id10922">"Pray to the Almighty to spare his life, and I will take upon myself to
promote his happiness."</p>

<p id="id10923">"Thank you, Edmond."</p>

<p id="id10924">"But have you no request to make for yourself, Mercedes?"</p>

<p id="id10925">"For myself I want nothing. I live, as it were, between two graves. One
is that of Edmond Dantes, lost to me long, long since. He had my love!
That word ill becomes my faded lip now, but it is a memory dear to my
heart, and one that I would not lose for all that the world contains.
The other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of
Edmond Dantes. I approve of the deed, but I must pray for the dead."</p>

<p id="id10926">"Your son shall be happy, Mercedes," repeated the count.</p>

<p id="id10927">"Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly
confer."</p>

<p id="id10928">"But what are your intentions?"</p>

<p id="id10929">"To say that I shall live here, like the Mercedes of other times,
gaining my bread by labor, would not be true, nor would you believe me.
I have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in
prayer. However, I shall have no occasion to work, for the little sum of
money buried by you, and which I found in the place you mentioned, will
be sufficient to maintain me. Rumor will probably be busy respecting me,
my occupations, my manner of living&#8212;that will signify but little."</p>

<p id="id10930">"Mercedes," said the count, "I do not say it to blame you, but you
made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune
amassed by M. de Morcerf; half of it at least by right belonged to you,
in virtue of your vigilance and economy."</p>

<p id="id10931">"I perceive what you are intending to propose to me; but I cannot accept
it, Edmond&#8212;my son would not permit it."</p>

<p id="id10932">"Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de
Morcerf. I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will
submit to them. But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you
oppose them?"</p>

<p id="id10933">"You well know, Edmond, that I am no longer a reasoning creature; I
have no will, unless it be the will never to decide. I have been so
overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head, that I
am become passive in the hands of the Almighty, like a sparrow in the
talons of an eagle. I live, because it is not ordained for me to die. If
succor be sent to me, I will accept it."</p>

<p id="id10934">"Ah, madame," said Monte Cristo, "you should not talk thus! It is not so
we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven; on the contrary,
we are all free agents."</p>

<p id="id10935">"Alas!" exclaimed Mercedes, "if it were so, if I possessed free-will,
but without the power to render that will efficacious, it would drive me
to despair." Monte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence
of her grief. "Will you not even say you will see me again?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id10936">"On the contrary, we shall meet again," said Mercedes, pointing to
heaven with solemnity. "I tell you so to prove to you that I still
hope." And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count,
Mercedes rushed up the stairs and disappeared. Monte Cristo slowly left
the house and turned towards the quay. But Mercedes did not witness
his departure, although she was seated at the little window of the room
which had been occupied by old Dantes. Her eyes were straining to see
the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea; but still her
voice involuntarily murmured softly, "Edmond, Edmond, Edmond!"</p>

<h2 id="id10937" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 113. The Past.</h2>

<p id="id10938">The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left
Mercedes, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little
Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached
the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an abyss
of doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation which
had just taken place between Mercedes and himself had awakened so many
recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with
them. A man of the count's temperament could not long indulge in that
melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys superior
ones. He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he
now found cause to blame himself.</p>

<p id="id10939">"I cannot have deceived myself," he said; "I must look upon the past in
a false light. What!" he continued, "can I have been following a false
path?&#8212;can the end which I proposed be a mistaken end?&#8212;can one hour
have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which
he founded all his hopes was an impossible, if not a sacrilegious,
undertaking? I cannot reconcile myself to this idea&#8212;it would madden
me. The reason why I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear
appreciation of the past. The past, like the country through which we
walk, becomes indistinct as we advance. My position is like that of
a person wounded in a dream; he feels the wound, though he cannot
recollect when he received it. Come, then, thou regenerate man,
thou extravagant prodigal, thou awakened sleeper, thou all-powerful
visionary, thou invincible millionaire,&#8212;once again review thy past
life of starvation and wretchedness, revisit the scenes where fate
and misfortune conducted, and where despair received thee. Too many
diamonds, too much gold and splendor, are now reflected by the mirror in
which Monte Cristo seeks to behold Dantes. Hide thy diamonds, bury thy
gold, shroud thy splendor, exchange riches for poverty, liberty for a
prison, a living body for a corpse!" As he thus reasoned, Monte Cristo
walked down the Rue de la Caisserie. It was the same through which,
twenty-four years ago, he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal
guard; the houses, to-day so smiling and animated, were on that night
dark, mute, and closed. "And yet they were the same," murmured Monte
Cristo, "only now it is broad daylight instead of night; it is the sun
which brightens the place, and makes it appear so cheerful."</p>

<p id="id10940">He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue Saint-Laurent, and advanced to
the Consigne; it was the point where he had embarked. A pleasure-boat
with striped awning was going by. Monte Cristo called the owner, who
immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a
good fare. The weather was magnificent, and the excursion a treat.</p>

<p id="id10941">The sun, red and flaming, was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming
ocean. The sea, smooth as crystal, was now and then disturbed by the
leaping of fish, which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for
safety in another element; while on the extreme verge of the horizon
might be seen the fishermen's boats, white and graceful as the sea-gull,
or the merchant vessels bound for Corsica or Spain.</p>

<p id="id10942">But notwithstanding the serene sky, the gracefully formed boats, and
the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed, the Count of Monte
Cristo, wrapped in his cloak, could think only of this terrible voyage,
the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory. The
solitary light burning at the Catalans; that first sight of the Chateau
d'If, which told him whither they were leading him; the struggle with
the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard; his despair
when he found himself vanquished, and the sensation when the muzzle of
the carbine touched his forehead&#8212;all these were brought before him
in vivid and frightful reality. Like the streams which the heat of the
summer has dried up, and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin
oozing drop by drop, so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with
the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantes. Clear
sky, swift-flitting boats, and brilliant sunshine disappeared; the
heavens were hung with black, and the gigantic structure of the Chateau
d'If seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy. As they reached the
shore, the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat,
and the owner was obliged to call out, in his sweetest tone of voice,
"Sir, we are at the landing."</p>

<p id="id10943">Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot, on the same rock, he had
been violently dragged by the guards, who forced him to ascend the slope
at the points of their bayonets. The journey had seemed very long to
Dantes, but Monte Cristo found it equally short. Each stroke of the oar
seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas, which sprang up with the flying
spray of the sea.</p>

<p id="id10944">There had been no prisoners confined in the Chateau d'If since the
revolution of July; it was only inhabited by a guard, kept there for the
prevention of smuggling. A concierge waited at the door to exhibit to
visitors this monument of curiosity, once a scene of terror. The count
inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there; but they
had all been pensioned, or had passed on to some other employment. The
concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830. He visited
his own dungeon. He again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to
penetrate the narrow opening. His eyes rested upon the spot where had
stood his bed, since then removed, and behind the bed the new stones
indicated where the breach made by the Abbe Faria had been. Monte Cristo
felt his limbs tremble; he seated himself upon a log of wood.</p>

<p id="id10945">"Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one
relating to the poisoning of Mirabeau?" asked the count; "are there any
traditions respecting these dismal abodes,&#8212;in which it is difficult to
believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures?"</p>

<p id="id10946">"Yes, sir; indeed, the jailer Antoine told me one connected with this
very dungeon."</p>

<p id="id10947">Monte Cristo shuddered; Antoine had been his jailer. He had almost
forgotten his name and face, but at the mention of the name he recalled
his person as he used to see it, the face encircled by a beard, wearing
the brown jacket, the bunch of keys, the jingling of which he still
seemed to hear. The count turned around, and fancied he saw him in the
corridor, rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge.
"Would you like to hear the story, sir?"</p>

<p id="id10948">"Yes; relate it," said Monte Cristo, pressing his hand to his heart to
still its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history.</p>

<p id="id10949">"This dungeon," said the concierge, "was, it appears, some time ago
occupied by a very dangerous prisoner, the more so since he was full of
industry. Another person was confined in the Chateau at the same time,
but he was not wicked, he was only a poor mad priest."</p>

<p id="id10950">"Ah, indeed?&#8212;mad!" repeated Monte Cristo; "and what was his mania?"</p>

<p id="id10951">"He offered millions to any one who would set him at liberty."</p>

<p id="id10952">Monte Cristo raised his eyes, but he could not see the heavens; there
was a stone veil between him and the firmament. He thought that there
had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria
offered the treasures. "Could the prisoners see each other?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id10953">"Oh, no, sir, it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance
of the guards, and made a passage from one dungeon to the other."</p>

<p id="id10954">"And which of them made this passage?"</p>

<p id="id10955">"Oh, it must have been the young man, certainly, for he was strong and
industrious, while the abbe was aged and weak; besides, his mind was too
vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea."</p>

<p id="id10956">"Blind fools!" murmured the count.</p>

<p id="id10957">"However, be that as it may, the young man made a tunnel, how or by
what means no one knows; but he made it, and there is the evidence yet
remaining of his work. Do you see it?" and the man held the torch to the
wall.</p>

<p id="id10958">"Ah, yes; I see," said the count, in a voice hoarse from emotion.</p>
