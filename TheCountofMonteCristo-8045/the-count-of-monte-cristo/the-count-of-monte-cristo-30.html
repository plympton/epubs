<p id="id08498">"What did he answer?"</p>

<p id="id08499">"He quietly said, 'What do I care if I am?'"</p>

<p id="id08500">"Andrea, he has some secretary with a spring."</p>

<p id="id08501">"How do you know?"</p>

<p id="id08502">"Yes, which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune. I was told
there were such at the last exhibition."</p>

<p id="id08503">"He has simply a mahogany secretary, in which the key is always kept."</p>

<p id="id08504">"And he is not robbed?"</p>

<p id="id08505">"No; his servants are all devoted to him."</p>

<p id="id08506">"There ought to be some money in that secretary?"</p>

<p id="id08507">"There may be. No one knows what there is."</p>

<p id="id08508">"And where is it?"</p>

<p id="id08509">"On the first floor."</p>

<p id="id08510">"Sketch me the plan of that floor, as you have done of the ground floor,
my boy."</p>

<p id="id08511">"That is very simple." Andrea took the pen. "On the first story, do you
see, there is the anteroom and the drawing-room; to the right of the
drawing-room, a library and a study; to the left, a bedroom and a
dressing-room. The famous secretary is in the dressing-room."</p>

<p id="id08512">"Is there a window in the dressing-room?"</p>

<p id="id08513">"Two,&#8212;one here and one there." Andrea sketched two windows in the room,
which formed an angle on the plan, and appeared as a small square added
to the rectangle of the bedroom. Caderousse became thoughtful. "Does he
often go to Auteuil?" added he.</p>

<p id="id08514">"Two or three times a week. To-morrow, for instance, he is going to
spend the day and night there."</p>

<p id="id08515">"Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p id="id08516">"He has invited me to dine there."</p>

<p id="id08517">"There's a life for you," said Caderousse; "a town house and a country
house."</p>

<p id="id08518">"That is what it is to be rich."</p>

<p id="id08519">"And shall you dine there?"</p>

<p id="id08520">"Probably."</p>

<p id="id08521">"When you dine there, do you sleep there?"</p>

<p id="id08522">"If I like; I am at home there." Caderousse looked at the young man, as
if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart. But Andrea drew
a cigar-case from his pocket, took a Havana, quietly lit it, and began
smoking. "When do you want your twelve hundred francs?" said he to
Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id08523">"Now, if you have them." Andrea took five and twenty louis from his
pocket.</p>

<p id="id08524">"Yellow boys?" said Caderousse; "no, I thank you."</p>

<p id="id08525">"Oh, you despise them."</p>

<p id="id08526">"On the contrary, I esteem them, but will not have them."</p>

<p id="id08527">"You can change them, idiot; gold is worth five sous."</p>

<p id="id08528">"Exactly; and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse, lay
hands on him, and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold. No
nonsense, my good fellow; silver simply, round coins with the head of
some monarch or other on them. Anybody may possess a five-franc piece."</p>

<p id="id08529">"But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me? I should
want a porter."</p>

<p id="id08530">"Well, leave them with your porter; he is to be trusted. I will call for
them."</p>

<p id="id08531">"To-day?"</p>

<p id="id08532">"No, to-morrow; I shall not have time to day."</p>

<p id="id08533">"Well, to-morrow I will leave them when I go to Auteuil."</p>

<p id="id08534">"May I depend on it?"</p>

<p id="id08535">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id08536">"Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it."</p>

<p id="id08537">"Now see here, will that be all? Eh? And will you not torment me any
more?"</p>

<p id="id08538">"Never." Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be
obliged to notice the change. He redoubled his gayety and carelessness.
"How sprightly you are," said Caderousse; "One would say you were
already in possession of your property."</p>

<p id="id08539">"No, unfortunately; but when I do obtain it"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08540">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id08541">"I shall remember old friends, I can tell you that."</p>

<p id="id08542">"Yes, since you have such a good memory."</p>

<p id="id08543">"What do you want? It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?"</p>

<p id="id08544">"I? What an idea! I, who am going to give you another piece of good
advice."</p>

<p id="id08545">"What is it?"</p>

<p id="id08546">"To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger. We shall both
get into trouble. You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly."</p>

<p id="id08547">"How so?" said Andrea.</p>

<p id="id08548">"How? You put on a livery, you disguise yourself as a servant, and yet
keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs."</p>

<p id="id08549">"You guess well."</p>

<p id="id08550">"I know something of diamonds; I have had some."</p>

<p id="id08551">"You do well to boast of it," said Andrea, who, without becoming angry,
as Caderousse feared, at this new extortion, quietly resigned the ring.
Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was
examining to see if all the edges were perfect.</p>

<p id="id08552">"It is a false diamond," said Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id08553">"You are joking now," replied Andrea.</p>

<p id="id08554">"Do not be angry, we can try it." Caderousse went to the window, touched
the glass with it, and found it would cut.</p>

<p id="id08555">"Confiteor," said Caderousse, putting the diamond on his little finger;
"I was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it
is no longer worth while to rob a jeweller's shop&#8212;it is another branch
of industry paralyzed."</p>

<p id="id08556">"Have you finished?" said Andrea,&#8212;"do you want anything more?&#8212;will you
have my waistcoat or my hat? Make free, now you have begun."</p>

<p id="id08557">"No; you are, after all, a good companion; I will not detain you, and
will try to cure myself of my ambition."</p>

<p id="id08558">"But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the
diamond you feared with the gold."</p>

<p id="id08559">"I shall not sell it&#8212;do not fear."</p>

<p id="id08560">"Not at least till the day after to-morrow," thought the young man.</p>

<p id="id08561">"Happy rogue," said Caderousse; "you are going to find your servants,
your horses, your carriage, and your betrothed!"</p>

<p id="id08562">"Yes," said Andrea.</p>

<p id="id08563">"Well, I hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry<br>

Mademoiselle Danglars."<br></p>

<p id="id08564">"I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head."</p>

<p id="id08565">"What fortune has she?"</p>

<p id="id08566">"But I tell you"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08567">"A million?" Andrea shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p id="id08568">"Let it be a million," said Caderousse; "you can never have so much as I
wish you."</p>

<p id="id08569">"Thank you," said the young man.</p>

<p id="id08570">"Oh, I wish it you with all my heart!" added Caderousse with his hoarse
laugh. "Stop, let me show you the way."</p>

<p id="id08571">"It is not worth while."</p>

<p id="id08572">"Yes, it is."</p>

<p id="id08573">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id08574">"Because there is a little secret, a precaution I thought it desirable
to take, one of Huret &amp; Fitchet's locks, revised and improved by
Gaspard Caderousse; I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a
capitalist."</p>

<p id="id08575">"Thank you," said Andrea; "I will let you know a week beforehand." They
parted. Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen
Andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court. Then he
returned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like a
clever architect, the plan Andrea had left him.</p>

<p id="id08576">"Dear Benedetto," said he, "I think he will not be sorry to inherit his
fortune, and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred
thousand will not be his worst friend."</p>

<h2 id="id08577" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 82. The Burglary.</h2>

<p id="id08578">The day following that on which the conversation we have related took
place, the Count of Monte Cristo set out for Auteuil, accompanied by
Ali and several attendants, and also taking with him some horses whose
qualities he was desirous of ascertaining. He was induced to undertake
this journey, of which the day before he had not even thought and which
had not occurred to Andrea either, by the arrival of Bertuccio from
Normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop. The house was
ready, and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a
small creek with her crew of six men, who had observed all the requisite
formalities and were ready again to put to sea.</p>

<p id="id08579">The count praised Bertuccio's zeal, and ordered him to prepare for a
speedy departure, as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than
a month. "Now," said he, "I may require to go in one night from Paris to
Treport; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road, which will
enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours."</p>

<p id="id08580">"Your highness had already expressed that wish," said Bertuccio, "and
the horses are ready. I have bought them, and stationed them myself at
the most desirable posts, that is, in villages, where no one generally
stops."</p>

<p id="id08581">"That's well," said Monte Cristo; "I remain here a day or two&#8212;arrange
accordingly." As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite
orders, Baptistin opened the door: he held a letter on a silver waiter.</p>

<p id="id08582">"What are you doing here?" asked the count, seeing him covered with
dust; "I did not send for you, I think?"</p>

<p id="id08583">Baptistin, without answering, approached the count, and presented the
letter. "Important and urgent," said he. The count opened the letter,
and read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08584">"M. de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his
house in the Champs-Elysees with the intention of carrying off some
papers supposed to be in the secretary in the dressing-room. The count's
well-known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police, whose
interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice. The
count, by any opening from the bedroom, or by concealing himself in
the dressing-room, would be able to defend his property himself. Many
attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from
the attempt, and M. de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of
discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this
warning to the count,&#8212;a warning he might not be able to send another
time, if this first attempt should fail and another be made."</p>

<p id="id08585">The count's first idea was that this was an artifice&#8212;a gross deception,
to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a
greater. He was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of
police, notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend, or perhaps
because of that advice, when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it
might be some personal enemy, whom he alone should recognize and over
whom, if such were the case, he alone would gain any advantage, as
Fiesco [*] had done over the Moor who would have killed him. We know the
Count's vigorous and daring mind, denying anything to be impossible,
with that energy which marks the great man. From his past life, from
his resolution to shrink from nothing, the count had acquired an
inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged, sometimes
against nature, that is to say, against God, and sometimes against the
world, that is, against the devil.</p>

<p id="id08586">     * The Genoese conspirator.</p>

<p id="id08587">"They do not want my papers," said Monte Cristo, "they want to kill
me; they are no robbers, but assassins. I will not allow the prefect of
police to interfere with my private affairs. I am rich enough, forsooth,
to distribute his authority on this occasion." The count recalled
Baptistin, who had left the room after delivering the letter. "Return to
Paris," said he; "assemble the servants who remain there. I want all my
household at Auteuil."</p>

<p id="id08588">"But will no one remain in the house, my lord?" asked Baptistin.</p>

<p id="id08589">"Yes, the porter."</p>

<p id="id08590">"My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house."</p>

<p id="id08591">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id08592">"The house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise."</p>

<p id="id08593">"By whom?"</p>

<p id="id08594">"By thieves."</p>

<p id="id08595">"You are a fool, M. Baptistin. Thieves might strip the house&#8212;it would
annoy me less than to be disobeyed." Baptistin bowed.</p>

<p id="id08596">"You understand me?" said the count. "Bring your comrades here, one and
all; but let everything remain as usual, only close the shutters of the
ground floor."</p>

<p id="id08597">"And those of the second floor?"</p>

<p id="id08598">"You know they are never closed. Go!"</p>

<p id="id08599">The count signified his intention of dining alone, and that no one but
Ali should attend him. Having dined with his usual tranquillity and
moderation, the count, making a signal to Ali to follow him, went out
by the side-gate and on reaching the Bois de Boulogne turned, apparently
without design towards Paris and at twilight; found himself opposite his
house in the Champs-Elysees. All was dark; one solitary, feeble light
was burning in the porter's lodge, about forty paces distant from the
house, as Baptistin had said. Monte Cristo leaned against a tree, and
with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived, looked up
and down the avenue, examined the passers-by, and carefully looked down
the neighboring streets, to see that no one was concealed. Ten minutes
passed thus, and he was convinced that no one was watching him. He
hastened to the side-door with Ali, entered hurriedly, and by the
servants' staircase, of which he had the key, gained his bedroom without
opening or disarranging a single curtain, without even the porter
having the slightest suspicion that the house, which he supposed empty,
contained its chief occupant.</p>

<p id="id08600">Arrived in his bedroom, the count motioned to Ali to stop; then he
passed into the dressing-room, which he examined. Everything appeared
as usual&#8212;the precious secretary in its place, and the key in the
secretary. He double locked it, took the key, returned to the bedroom
door, removed the double staple of the bolt, and went in. Meanwhile Ali
had procured the arms the count required&#8212;namely, a short carbine and
a pair of double-barrelled pistols, with which as sure an aim might be
taken as with a single-barrelled one. Thus armed, the count held the
lives of five men in his hands. It was about half-past nine. The count
and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine;
then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels, which enabled
him to see into the adjoining room. He had within his reach his pistols
and carbine, and Ali, standing near him, held one of the small Arabian
hatchets, whose form has not varied since the Crusades. Through one of
the windows of the bedroom, on a line with that in the dressing-room,
the count could see into the street.</p>

<p id="id08601">Two hours passed thus. It was intensely dark; still Ali, thanks to his
wild nature, and the count, thanks doubtless to his long confinement,
could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees.
The little light in the lodge had long been extinct. It might be
expected that the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be
made from the staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in
Monte Cristo's opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money. It
would be his bedroom they would attack, and they must reach it by the
back staircase, or by the window in the dressing-room. The clock of
the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve; the west wind bore on its
moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes.</p>

<p id="id08602">As the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise
in the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding,
was followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew
what to expect. A firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting
the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond. The count felt his
heart beat more rapidly. Inured as men may be to danger, forewarned as
they may be of peril, they understand, by the fluttering of the heart
and the shuddering of the frame, the enormous difference between a dream
and a reality, between the project and the execution. However, Monte
Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali, who, understanding that danger
was approaching from the other side, drew nearer to his master. Monte
Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies.</p>

<p id="id08603">The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which
the count could see into the dressing-room. He fixed his eyes on that
window&#8212;he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes
became quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside,
then the square cracked without falling. Through the opening an arm was
passed to find the fastening, then a second; the window turned on its
hinges, and a man entered. He was alone.</p>

<p id="id08604">"That's a daring rascal," whispered the count.</p>

<p id="id08605">At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder. He turned; Ali
pointed to the window of the room in which they were, facing the street.
"I see!" said he, "there are two of them; one does the work while the
other stands guard." He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man
in the street, and turned to the one in the dressing-room.</p>

<p id="id08606">The glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms
stretched out before him. At last he appeared to have made himself
familiar with his surroundings. There were two doors; he bolted them
both.</p>

<p id="id08607">When he drew near to the bedroom door, Monte Cristo expected that he was
coming in, and raised one of his pistols; but he simply heard the sound
of the bolts sliding in their copper rings. It was only a precaution.
The nocturnal visitor, ignorant of the fact that the count had removed
the staples, might now think himself at home, and pursue his purpose
with full security. Alone and free to act as he wished, the man then
drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern, placed
it on a stand, then went straight to the secretary, felt the lock, and
contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing. But the
glass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies. The
count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys, such as the
locksmith brings when called to force a lock, and which thieves call
nightingales, doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they
grind against the bolt. "Ah, ha," whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of
disappointment, "he is only a thief."</p>

<p id="id08608">But the man in the dark could not find the right key. He reached the
instrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and immediately
a pale light, just bright enough to render objects distinct, was
reflected on his hands and countenance. "By heavens," exclaimed Monte
Cristo, starting back, "it is"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08609">Ali raised his hatchet. "Don't stir," whispered Monte Cristo, "and put
down your hatchet; we shall require no arms." Then he added some words
in a low tone, for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the
count, faint as it had been, had startled the man who remained in the
pose of the old knife-grinder. It was an order the count had just given,
for immediately Ali went noiselessly, and returned, bearing a black
dress and a three-cornered hat. Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken
off his great-coat, waistcoat, and shirt, and one might distinguish by
the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of
steel mail, of which the last in France, where daggers are no longer
dreaded, was worn by King Louis XVI., who feared the dagger at his
breast, and whose head was cleft with a hatchet. The tunic soon
disappeared under a long cassock, as did his hair under a priest's wig;
the three-cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into
an abbe.</p>

<p id="id08610">The man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was
completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretary, whose
lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale.</p>

<p id="id08611">"Try again," whispered the count, who depended on the secret spring,
which was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be&#8212;"try again,
you have a few minutes' work there." And he advanced to the window.
The man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down, and was still
pacing the street; but, strange as it appeared, he cared not for those
who might pass from the avenue of the Champs-Elysees or by the Faubourg
St. Honore; his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the
count's, and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in
the dressing-room.</p>

<p id="id08612">Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile
passed over his lips; then drawing near to Ali, he whispered,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08613">"Remain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear,
whatever passes, only come in or show yourself if I call you." Ali bowed
in token of strict obedience. Monte Cristo then drew a lighted taper
from a closet, and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock,
silently opened the door, taking care that the light should shine
directly on his face. The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no
sound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly illuminated. He
turned.</p>

<p id="id08614">"Ah, good-evening, my dear M. Caderousse," said Monte Cristo; "what are
you doing here, at such an hour?"</p>

<p id="id08615">"The Abbe Busoni!" exclaimed Caderousse; and, not knowing how this
strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors, he
let fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied. The
count placed himself between Caderousse and the window, thus cutting off
from the thief his only chance of retreat. "The Abbe Busoni!" repeated
Caderousse, fixing his haggard gaze on the count.</p>

<p id="id08616">"Yes, undoubtedly, the Abbe Busoni himself," replied Monte Cristo. "And
I am very glad you recognize me, dear M. Caderousse; it proves you have
a good memory, for it must be about ten years since we last met." This
calmness of Busoni, combined with his irony and boldness, staggered
Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id08617">"The abbe, the abbe!" murmured he, clinching his fists, and his teeth
chattering.</p>

<p id="id08618">"So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo?" continued the false abbe.</p>

<p id="id08619">"Reverend sir," murmured Caderousse, seeking to regain the window, which
the count pitilessly blocked&#8212;"reverend sir, I don't know&#8212;believe me&#8212;I
take my oath"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08620">"A pane of glass out," continued the count, "a dark lantern, a bunch of
false keys, a secretary half forced&#8212;it is tolerably evident"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08621">Caderousse was choking; he looked around for some corner to hide in,
some way of escape.</p>

<p id="id08622">"Come, come," continued the count, "I see you are still the same,&#8212;an
assassin."</p>

<p id="id08623">"Reverend sir, since you know everything, you know it was not I&#8212;it was
La Carconte; that was proved at the trial, since I was only condemned to
the galleys."</p>

<p id="id08624">"Is your time, then, expired, since I find you in a fair way to return
there?"</p>

<p id="id08625">"No, reverend sir; I have been liberated by some one."</p>

<p id="id08626">"That some one has done society a great kindness."</p>

<p id="id08627">"Ah," said Caderousse, "I had promised"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08628">"And you are breaking your promise!" interrupted Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id08629">"Alas, yes!" said Caderousse very uneasily.</p>

<p id="id08630">"A bad relapse, that will lead you, if I mistake not, to the Place de
Greve. So much the worse, so much the worse&#8212;diavolo, as they say in my
country."</p>

<p id="id08631">"Reverend sir, I am impelled"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08632">"Every criminal says the same thing."</p>

<p id="id08633">"Poverty"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08634">"Pshaw!" said Busoni disdainfully; "poverty may make a man beg, steal a
loaf of bread at a baker's door, but not cause him to open a secretary
in a house supposed to be inhabited. And when the jeweller Johannes had
just paid you 40,000. francs for the diamond I had given you, and
you killed him to get the diamond and the money both, was that also
poverty?"</p>

<p id="id08635">"Pardon, reverend sir," said Caderousse; "you have saved my life once,
save me again!"</p>

<p id="id08636">"That is but poor encouragement."</p>

<p id="id08637">"Are you alone, reverend sir, or have you there soldiers ready to seize
me?"</p>

<p id="id08638">"I am alone," said the abbe, "and I will again have pity on you, and
will let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may
lead to, if you tell me the truth."</p>

<p id="id08639">"Ah, reverend sir," cried Caderousse, clasping his hands, and drawing
nearer to Monte Cristo, "I may indeed say you are my deliverer!"</p>

<p id="id08640">"You mean to say you have been freed from confinement?"</p>

<p id="id08641">"Yes, that is true, reverend sir."</p>

<p id="id08642">"Who was your liberator?"</p>

<p id="id08643">"An Englishman."</p>

<p id="id08644">"What was his name?"</p>

<p id="id08645">"Lord Wilmore."</p>

<p id="id08646">"I know him; I shall know if you lie."</p>

<p id="id08647">"Ah, reverend sir, I tell you the simple truth."</p>

<p id="id08648">"Was this Englishman protecting you?"</p>

<p id="id08649">"No, not me, but a young Corsican, my companion."</p>

<p id="id08650">"What was this young Corsican's name?"</p>

<p id="id08651">"Benedetto."</p>

<p id="id08652">"Is that his Christian name?"</p>

<p id="id08653">"He had no other; he was a foundling."</p>

<p id="id08654">"Then this young man escaped with you?"</p>

<p id="id08655">"He did."</p>

<p id="id08656">"In what way?"</p>

<p id="id08657">"We were working at St. Mandrier, near Toulon. Do you know St.<br>

Mandrier?"<br></p>

<p id="id08658">"I do."</p>

<p id="id08659">"In the hour of rest, between noon and one o'clock"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08660">"Galley-slaves having a nap after dinner! We may well pity the poor
fellows!" said the abbe.</p>

<p id="id08661">"Nay," said Caderousse, "one can't always work&#8212;one is not a dog."</p>

<p id="id08662">"So much the better for the dogs," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id08663">"While the rest slept, then, we went away a short distance; we severed
our fetters with a file the Englishman had given us, and swam away."</p>

<p id="id08664">"And what is become of this Benedetto?"</p>

<p id="id08665">"I don't know."</p>

<p id="id08666">"You ought to know."</p>

<p id="id08667">"No, in truth; we parted at Hyeres." And, to give more weight to his
protestation, Caderousse advanced another step towards the abbe, who
remained motionless in his place, as calm as ever, and pursuing
his interrogation. "You lie," said the Abbe Busoni, with a tone of
irresistible authority.</p>

<p id="id08668">"Reverend sir!"</p>

<p id="id08669">"You lie! This man is still your friend, and you, perhaps, make use of
him as your accomplice."</p>

<p id="id08670">"Oh, reverend sir!"</p>

<p id="id08671">"Since you left Toulon what have you lived on? Answer me!"</p>

<p id="id08672">"On what I could get."</p>

<p id="id08673">"You lie," repeated the abbe a third time, with a still more imperative
tone. Caderousse, terrified, looked at the count. "You have lived on the
money he has given you."</p>

<p id="id08674">"True," said Caderousse; "Benedetto has become the son of a great lord."</p>

<p id="id08675">"How can he be the son of a great lord?"</p>

<p id="id08676">"A natural son."</p>

<p id="id08677">"And what is that great lord's name?"</p>

<p id="id08678">"The Count of Monte Cristo, the very same in whose house we are."</p>

<p id="id08679">"Benedetto the count's son?" replied Monte Cristo, astonished in his
turn.</p>

<p id="id08680">"Well, I should think so, since the count has found him a false
father&#8212;since the count gives him four thousand francs a month, and
leaves him 500,000 francs in his will."</p>

<p id="id08681">"Ah, yes," said the factitious abbe, who began to understand; "and what
name does the young man bear meanwhile?"</p>

<p id="id08682">"Andrea Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id08683">"Is it, then, that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo
has received into his house, and who is going to marry Mademoiselle
Danglars?"</p>

<p id="id08684">"Exactly."</p>

<p id="id08685">"And you suffer that, you wretch&#8212;you, who know his life and his crime?"</p>

<p id="id08686">"Why should I stand in a comrade's way?" said Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id08687">"You are right; it is not you who should apprise M. Danglars, it is I."</p>

<p id="id08688">"Do not do so, reverend sir."</p>

<p id="id08689">"Why not?"</p>

<p id="id08690">"Because you would bring us to ruin."</p>

<p id="id08691">"And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an
abettor of their plot, an accomplice in their crimes?"</p>

<p id="id08692">"Reverend sir," said Caderousse, drawing still nearer.</p>

<p id="id08693">"I will expose all."</p>

<p id="id08694">"To whom?"</p>

<p id="id08695">"To M. Danglars."</p>

<p id="id08696">"By heaven!" cried Caderousse, drawing from his waistcoat an open knife,
and striking the count in the breast, "you shall disclose nothing,
reverend sir!" To Caderousse's great astonishment, the knife, instead of
piercing the count's breast, flew back blunted. At the same moment the
count seized with his left hand the assassin's wrist, and wrung it
with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers, and
Caderousse uttered a cry of pain. But the count, disregarding his cry,
continued to wring the bandit's wrist, until, his arm being dislocated,
he fell first on his knees, then flat on the floor. The count then
placed his foot on his head, saying, "I know not what restrains me from
crushing thy skull, rascal."</p>

<p id="id08697">"Ah, mercy&#8212;mercy!" cried Caderousse. The count withdrew his foot.<br>

"Rise!" said he. Caderousse rose.<br></p>

<p id="id08698">"What a wrist you have, reverend sir!" said Caderousse, stroking his
arm, all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it; "what a
wrist!"</p>

<p id="id08699">"Silence! God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you; in
the name of that God I act,&#8212;remember that, wretch,&#8212;and to spare thee
at this moment is still serving him."</p>

<p id="id08700">"Oh!" said Caderousse, groaning with pain.</p>

<p id="id08701">"Take this pen and paper, and write what I dictate."</p>

<p id="id08702">"I don't know how to write, reverend sir."</p>

<p id="id08703">"You lie! Take this pen, and write!" Caderousse, awed by the superior
power of the abbe, sat down and wrote:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08704">Sir,&#8212;The man whom you are receiving at your house, and to whom you
intend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from
confinement at Toulon. He was No. 59, and I No. 58. He was called
Benedetto, but he is ignorant of his real name, having never known his
parents.</p>

<p id="id08705">"Sign it!" continued the count.</p>

<p id="id08706">"But would you ruin me?"</p>

<p id="id08707">"If I sought your ruin, fool, I should drag you to the first
guard-house; besides, when that note is delivered, in all probability
you will have no more to fear. Sign it, then!"</p>

<p id="id08708">Caderousse signed it. "The address, 'To monsieur the Baron Danglars,
banker, Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin.'" Caderousse wrote the address. The
abbe took the note. "Now," said he, "that suffices&#8212;begone!"</p>

<p id="id08709">"Which way?"</p>

<p id="id08710">"The way you came."</p>

<p id="id08711">"You wish me to get out at that window?"</p>

<p id="id08712">"You got in very well."</p>

<p id="id08713">"Oh, you have some design against me, reverend sir."</p>

<p id="id08714">"Idiot! what design can I have?"</p>

<p id="id08715">"Why, then, not let me out by the door?"</p>

<p id="id08716">"What would be the advantage of waking the porter?"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08717">"Ah, reverend sir, tell me, do you wish me dead?"</p>

<p id="id08718">"I wish what God wills."</p>

<p id="id08719">"But swear that you will not strike me as I go down."</p>

<p id="id08720">"Cowardly fool!"</p>

<p id="id08721">"What do you intend doing with me?"</p>

<p id="id08722">"I ask you what can I do? I have tried to make you a happy man, and you
have turned out a murderer."</p>

<p id="id08723">"Oh, monsieur," said Caderousse, "make one more attempt&#8212;try me once
more!"</p>

<p id="id08724">"I will," said the count. "Listen&#8212;you know if I may be relied on."</p>

<p id="id08725">"Yes," said Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id08726">"If you arrive safely at home"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08727">"What have I to fear, except from you?"</p>

<p id="id08728">"If you reach your home safely, leave Paris, leave France, and wherever
you may be, so long as you conduct yourself well, I will send you a
small annuity; for, if you return home safely, then"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08729">"Then?" asked Caderousse, shuddering.</p>

<p id="id08730">"Then I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you too."</p>

<p id="id08731">"As true as I am a Christian," stammered Caderousse, "you will make me
die of fright!"</p>

<p id="id08732">"Now begone," said the count, pointing to the window.</p>

<p id="id08733">Caderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out
of the window and stood on the ladder. "Now go down," said the abbe,
folding his arms. Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him,
Caderousse began to go down. Then the count brought the taper to the
window, that it might be seen in the Champs-Elysees that a man was
getting out of the window while another held a light.</p>

<p id="id08734">"What are you doing, reverend sir? Suppose a watchman should pass?" And
he blew out the light. He then descended, but it was only when he felt
his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety.</p>

<p id="id08735">Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the
garden to the street, he saw first Caderousse, who after walking to the
end of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part
from where he came in. The count then looking over into the street, saw
the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction, and place
himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come over.
Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly, and looked over the coping to see
if the street was quiet. No one could be seen or heard. The clock of
the Invalides struck one. Then Caderousse sat astride the coping, and
drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall; then he began to descend,
or rather to slide down by the two stanchions, which he did with an ease
which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise. But, once started,
he could not stop. In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when
he was halfway down&#8212;in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the
ground. Before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently
in the back that he let go the ladder, crying, "Help!" A second blow
struck him almost immediately in the side, and he fell, calling, "Help,
murder!" Then, as he rolled on the ground, his adversary seized him by
the hair, and struck him a third blow in the chest. This time Caderousse
endeavored to call again, but he could only utter a groan, and he
shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds. The assassin,
finding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up by the hair; his
eyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted. The murderer, supposing
him dead, let fall his head and disappeared. Then Caderousse, feeling
that he was leaving him, raised himself on his elbow, and with a dying
voice cried with great effort, "Murder! I am dying! Help, reverend
sir,&#8212;help!"</p>

<p id="id08736">This mournful appeal pierced the darkness. The door of the
back-staircase opened, then the side-gate of the garden, and Ali and his
master were on the spot with lights.</p>

<h2 id="id08737" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 83. The Hand of God.</h2>

<p id="id08738">Caderousse continued to call piteously, "Help, reverend sir, help!"</p>

<p id="id08739">"What is the matter?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id08740">"Help," cried Caderousse; "I am murdered!"</p>

<p id="id08741">"We are here;&#8212;take courage."</p>

<p id="id08742">"Ah, it's all over! You are come too late&#8212;you are come to see me die.
What blows, what blood!" He fainted. Ali and his master conveyed the
wounded man into a room. Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him,
and he then examined his dreadful wounds. "My God!" he exclaimed, "thy
vengeance is sometimes delayed, but only that it may fall the more
effectually." Ali looked at his master for further instructions. "Bring
here immediately the king's attorney, M. de Villefort, who lives in the
Faubourg St. Honore. As you pass the lodge, wake the porter, and send
him for a surgeon." Ali obeyed, leaving the abbe alone with Caderousse,
who had not yet revived.</p>

<p id="id08743">When the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him
with a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.
"A surgeon, reverend sir&#8212;a surgeon!" said Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id08744">"I have sent for one," replied the abbe.</p>

<p id="id08745">"I know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my
evidence."</p>

<p id="id08746">"Against whom?"</p>

<p id="id08747">"Against my murderer."</p>

<p id="id08748">"Did you recognize him?"</p>

<p id="id08749">"Yes; it was Benedetto."</p>

<p id="id08750">"The young Corsican?"</p>

<p id="id08751">"Himself."</p>

<p id="id08752">"Your comrade?"</p>

<p id="id08753">"Yes. After giving me the plan of this house, doubtless hoping I should
kill the count and he thus become his heir, or that the count would kill
me and I should be out of his way, he waylaid me, and has murdered me."</p>

<p id="id08754">"I have also sent for the procureur."</p>

<p id="id08755">"He will not come in time; I feel my life fast ebbing."</p>

<p id="id08756">"Wait a moment," said Monte Cristo. He left the room, and returned
in five minutes with a phial. The dying man's eyes were all the time
riveted on the door, through which he hoped succor would arrive.
"Hasten, reverend sir, hasten! I shall faint again!" Monte Cristo
approached, and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the
contents of the phial. Caderousse drew a deep breath. "Oh," said he,
"that is life to me; more, more!"</p>

<p id="id08757">"Two drops more would kill you," replied the abbe.</p>

<p id="id08758">"Oh, send for some one to whom I can denounce the wretch!"</p>

<p id="id08759">"Shall I write your deposition? You can sign it."</p>

<p id="id08760">"Yes, yes," said Caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of
this posthumous revenge. Monte Cristo wrote:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08761">"I die, murdered by the Corsican Benedetto, my comrade in the galleys at<br>

Toulouse, No. 59."<br></p>

<p id="id08762">"Quick, quick!" said Caderousse, "or I shall be unable to sign it."</p>

<p id="id08763">Monte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse, who collected all his strength,
signed it, and fell back on his bed, saying: "You will relate all the
rest, reverend sir; you will say he calls himself Andrea Cavalcanti. He
lodges at the Hotel des Princes. Oh, I am dying!" He again fainted. The
abbe made him smell the contents of the phial, and he again opened his
eyes. His desire for revenge had not forsaken him.</p>

<p id="id08764">"Ah, you will tell all I have said, will you not, reverend sir?"</p>

<p id="id08765">"Yes, and much more."</p>

<p id="id08766">"What more will you say?"</p>

<p id="id08767">"I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house, in the
hope the count would kill you. I will say, likewise, he had apprised the
count, by a note, of your intention, and, the count being absent, I read
the note and sat up to await you."</p>

<p id="id08768">"And he will be guillotined, will be not?" said Caderousse. "Promise me
that, and I will die with that hope."</p>

<p id="id08769">"I will say," continued the count, "that he followed and watched you the
whole time, and when he saw you leave the house, ran to the angle of the
wall to conceal himself."</p>

<p id="id08770">"Did you see all that?"</p>

<p id="id08771">"Remember my words: 'If you return home safely, I shall believe God has
forgiven you, and I will forgive you also.'"</p>

<p id="id08772">"And you did not warn me!" cried Caderousse, raising himself on his
elbows. "You knew I should be killed on leaving this house, and did not
warn me!"</p>

<p id="id08773">"No; for I saw God's justice placed in the hands of Benedetto, and
should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence."</p>

<p id="id08774">"God's justice! Speak not of it, reverend sir. If God were just, you
know how many would be punished who now escape."</p>

<p id="id08775">"Patience," said the abbe, in a tone which made the dying man shudder;
"have patience!" Caderousse looked at him with amazement. "Besides,"
said the abbe, "God is merciful to all, as he has been to you; he is
first a father, then a judge."</p>

<p id="id08776">"Do you then believe in God?" said Caderousse.</p>

<p id="id08777">"Had I been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now," said Monte
Cristo, "I must believe on seeing you." Caderousse raised his clinched
hands towards heaven.</p>

<p id="id08778">"Listen," said the abbe, extending his hand over the wounded man, as
if to command him to believe; "this is what the God in whom, on your
death-bed, you refuse to believe, has done for you&#8212;he gave you health,
strength, regular employment, even friends&#8212;a life, in fact, which a man
might enjoy with a calm conscience. Instead of improving these gifts,
rarely granted so abundantly, this has been your course&#8212;you have given
yourself up to sloth and drunkenness, and in a fit of intoxication have
ruined your best friend."</p>

<p id="id08779">"Help!" cried Caderousse; "I require a surgeon, not a priest; perhaps
I am not mortally wounded&#8212;I may not die; perhaps they can yet save my
life."</p>

<p id="id08780">"Your wounds are so far mortal that, without the three drops I gave you,
you would now be dead. Listen, then."</p>

<p id="id08781">"Ah," murmured Caderousse, "what a strange priest you are; you drive the
dying to despair, instead of consoling them."</p>

<p id="id08782">"Listen," continued the abbe. "When you had betrayed your friend God
began not to strike, but to warn you. Poverty overtook you. You had
already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have
honorably acquired; and already you contemplated crime under the excuse
of want, when God worked a miracle in your behalf, sending you, by my
hands, a fortune&#8212;brilliant, indeed, for you, who had never possessed
any. But this unexpected, unhoped-for, unheard-of fortune sufficed
you no longer when you once possessed it; you wished to double it, and
how?&#8212;by a murder! You succeeded, and then God snatched it from you, and
brought you to justice."</p>

<p id="id08783">"It was not I who wished to kill the Jew," said Caderousse; "it was La<br>

Carconte."<br></p>

<p id="id08784">"Yes," said Monte Cristo, "and God,&#8212;I cannot say in justice, for his
justice would have slain you,&#8212;but God, in his mercy, spared your life."</p>

<p id="id08785">"Pardieu, to transport me for life, how merciful!"</p>

<p id="id08786">"You thought it a mercy then, miserable wretch! The coward who feared
death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace; for like all galley-slaves, you
said, 'I may escape from prison, I cannot from the grave.' And you said
truly; the way was opened for you unexpectedly. An Englishman visited
Toulon, who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy, and his choice
fell on you and your companion. You received a second fortune, money and
tranquillity were restored to you, and you, who had been condemned to a
felon's life, might live as other men. Then, wretched creature, then you
tempted God a third time. 'I have not enough,' you said, when you had
more than you before possessed, and you committed a third crime, without
reason, without excuse. God is wearied; he has punished you." Caderousse
was fast sinking. "Give me drink," said he: "I thirst&#8212;I burn!" Monte
Cristo gave him a glass of water. "And yet that villain, Benedetto, will
escape!"</p>

<p id="id08787">"No one, I tell you, will escape; Benedetto will be punished."</p>

<p id="id08788">"Then, you, too, will be punished, for you did not do your duty as a
priest&#8212;you should have prevented Benedetto from killing me."</p>

<p id="id08789">"I?" said the count, with a smile which petrified the dying man, "when
you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected
my breast! Yet perhaps if I had found you humble and penitent, I might
have prevented Benedetto from killing you; but I found you proud and
blood-thirsty, and I left you in the hands of God."</p>

<p id="id08790">"I do not believe there is a God," howled Caderousse; "you do not
believe it; you lie&#8212;you lie!"</p>

<p id="id08791">"Silence," said the abbe; "you will force the last drop of blood from
your veins. What! you do not believe in God when he is striking you
dead? you will not believe in him, who requires but a prayer, a word, a
tear, and he will forgive? God, who might have directed the assassin's
dagger so as to end your career in a moment, has given you this quarter
of an hour for repentance. Reflect, then, wretched man, and repent."</p>

<p id="id08792">"No," said Caderousse, "no; I will not repent. There is no God; there is
no providence&#8212;all comes by chance."&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08793">"There is a providence; there is a God," said Monte Cristo, "of whom you
are a striking proof, as you lie in utter despair, denying him, while I
stand before you, rich, happy, safe and entreating that God in whom you
endeavor not to believe, while in your heart you still believe in him."</p>

<p id="id08794">"But who are you, then?" asked Caderousse, fixing his dying eyes on the
count. "Look well at me!" said Monte Cristo, putting the light near his
face. "Well, the abbe&#8212;the Abbe Busoni." Monte Cristo took off the wig
which disfigured him, and let fall his black hair, which added so
much to the beauty of his pallid features. "Oh?" said Caderousse,
thunderstruck, "but for that black hair, I should say you were the
Englishman, Lord Wilmore."</p>

<p id="id08795">"I am neither the Abbe Busoni nor Lord Wilmore," said Monte Cristo;
"think again,&#8212;do you not recollect me?" Those was a magic effect in
the count's words, which once more revived the exhausted powers of the
miserable man. "Yes, indeed," said he; "I think I have seen you and
known you formerly."</p>

<p id="id08796">"Yes, Caderousse, you have seen me; you knew me once."</p>

<p id="id08797">"Who, then, are you? and why, if you knew me, do you let me die?"</p>

<p id="id08798">"Because nothing can save you; your wounds are mortal. Had it been
possible to save you, I should have considered it another proof of God's
mercy, and I would again have endeavored to restore you, I swear by my
father's tomb."</p>

<p id="id08799">"By your father's tomb!" said Caderousse, supported by a supernatural
power, and half-raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had
just taken the oath which all men hold sacred; "who, then, are you?"
The count had watched the approach of death. He knew this was the last
struggle. He approached the dying man, and, leaning over him with a calm
and melancholy look, he whispered, "I am&#8212;I am"&#8212;And his almost closed
lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to
hear it. Caderousse, who had raised himself on his knees, and stretched
out his arm, tried to draw back, then clasping his hands, and raising
them with a desperate effort, "O my God, my God!" said he, "pardon me
for having denied thee; thou dost exist, thou art indeed man's father
in heaven, and his judge on earth. My God, my Lord, I have long despised
thee! Pardon me, my God; receive me, O my Lord!" Caderousse sighed
deeply, and fell back with a groan. The blood no longer flowed from his
wounds. He was dead.</p>

<p id="id08800">"One!" said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse,
disfigured by so awful a death. Ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and
the procureur arrived, the one accompanied by the porter, the other by
Ali, and were received by the Abbe Busoni, who was praying by the side
of the corpse.</p>

<h2 id="id08801" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 84. Beauchamp.</h2>

<p id="id08802">The daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation
throughout Paris for the next fortnight. The dying man had signed a
deposition declaring Benedetto to be the assassin. The police had orders
to make the strictest search for the murderer. Caderousse's knife, dark
lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which
could not be found, were deposited at the registry; the corpse was
conveyed to the morgue. The count told every one that this adventure had
happened during his absence at Auteuil, and that he only knew what
was related by the Abbe Busoni, who that evening, by mere chance, had
requested to pass the night in his house, to examine some valuable books
in his library. Bertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedetto's name
was mentioned in his presence, but there was no reason why any one
should notice his doing so. Villefort, being called on to prove
the crime, was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was
accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases.</p>

<p id="id08803">But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had
been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber
by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching
marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti. It was
expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young
man was received at the banker's as the betrothed. Letters had been
despatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count's father, who highly approved
of the union, regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time, and
promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres. It
was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to
invest; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of
his future father-in-law, who had of late sustained repeated losses; but
with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused
to listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron. The baron adored
Count Andrea Cavalcanti: not so Mademoiselle Eugenie Danglars. With an
instinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered Andrea's attentions
in order to get rid of Morcerf; but when Andrea urged his suit, she
betrayed an entire dislike to him. The baron might possibly have
perceived it, but, attributing it to a caprice, feigned ignorance.</p>

<p id="id08804">The delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired. Morcerf appreciated
the advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord.
No one had taken up the remark about the general, and no one had
recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble
count in the House of Peers. Albert, however felt no less insulted; the
few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult.
Besides, the manner in which Beauchamp had closed the conference left a
bitter recollection in his heart. He cherished the thought of the duel,
hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds. Beauchamp had
not been seen since the day he visited Albert, and those of whom the
latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would
detain him some days. Where he was no one knew.</p>

<p id="id08805">One morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre, who announced
Beauchamp. Albert rubbed his eyes, ordered his servant to introduce
him into the small smoking-room on the ground-floor, dressed himself
quickly, and went down. He found Beauchamp pacing the room; on
perceiving him Beauchamp stopped. "Your arrival here, without waiting my
visit at your house to-day, looks well, sir," said Albert. "Tell me, may
I shake hands with you, saying, 'Beauchamp, acknowledge you have injured
me, and retain my friendship,' or must I simply propose to you a choice
of arms?"</p>

<p id="id08806">"Albert," said Beauchamp, with a look of sorrow which stupefied the
young man, "let us first sit down and talk."</p>

<p id="id08807">"Rather, sir, before we sit down, I must demand your answer."</p>

<p id="id08808">"Albert," said the journalist, "these are questions which it is
difficult to answer."</p>

<p id="id08809">"I will facilitate it by repeating the question, 'Will you, or will you
not, retract?'"</p>

<p id="id08810">"Morcerf, it is not enough to answer 'yes' or 'no' to questions which
concern the honor, the social interest, and the life of such a man as
Lieutenant-general the Count of Morcerf, peer of France."</p>

<p id="id08811">"What must then be done?"</p>

<p id="id08812">"What I have done, Albert. I reasoned thus&#8212;money, time, and fatigue are
nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family;
probabilities will not suffice, only facts will justify a deadly combat
with a friend. If I strike with the sword, or discharge the contents
of a pistol at man with whom, for three years, I have been on terms of
intimacy, I must, at least, know why I do so; I must meet him with a
heart at ease, and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own
arm must save his life."</p>

<p id="id08813">"Well," said Morcerf, impatiently, "what does all this mean?"</p>

<p id="id08814">"It means that I have just returned from Yanina."</p>

<p id="id08815">"From Yanina?"</p>

<p id="id08816">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id08817">"Impossible!"</p>

<p id="id08818">"Here is my passport; examine the visa&#8212;Geneva, Milan, Venice, Trieste,
Delvino, Yanina. Will you believe the government of a republic, a
kingdom, and an empire?" Albert cast his eyes on the passport, then
raised them in astonishment to Beauchamp. "You have been to Yanina?"
said he.</p>

<p id="id08819">"Albert, had you been a stranger, a foreigner, a simple lord, like that
Englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since,
and whom I killed to get rid of, I should not have taken this trouble;
but I thought this mark of consideration due to you. I took a week to
go, another to return, four days of quarantine, and forty-eight hours
to stay there; that makes three weeks. I returned last night, and here I
am."</p>

<p id="id08820">"What circumlocution! How long you are before you tell me what I most
wish to know?"</p>

<p id="id08821">"Because, in truth, Albert"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08822">"You hesitate?"</p>

<p id="id08823">"Yes,&#8212;I fear."</p>

<p id="id08824">"You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent his deceived you? Oh,
no self-love, Beauchamp. Acknowledge it, Beauchamp; your courage cannot
be doubted."</p>

<p id="id08825">"Not so," murmured the journalist; "on the contrary"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08826">Albert turned frightfully pale; he endeavored to speak, but the words
died on his lips. "My friend," said Beauchamp, in the most affectionate
tone, "I should gladly make an apology; but, alas,"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08827">"But what?"</p>

<p id="id08828">"The paragraph was correct, my friend."</p>

<p id="id08829">"What? That French officer"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08830">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id08831">"Fernand?"</p>

<p id="id08832">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id08833">"The traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he
was"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08834">"Pardon me, my friend, that man was your father!" Albert advanced
furiously towards Beauchamp, but the latter restrained him more by a
mild look than by his extended hand.</p>

<p id="id08835">"My friend," said he, "here is a proof of it."</p>

<p id="id08836">Albert opened the paper, it was an attestation of four notable
inhabitants of Yanina, proving that Colonel Fernand Mondego, in the
service of Ali Tepelini, had surrendered the castle for two million
crowns. The signatures were perfectly legal. Albert tottered and fell
overpowered in a chair. It could no longer be doubted; the family
name was fully given. After a moment's mournful silence, his heart
overflowed, and he gave way to a flood of tears. Beauchamp, who had
watched with sincere pity the young man's paroxysm of grief, approached
him. "Now, Albert," said he, "you understand me&#8212;do you not? I wished to
see all, and to judge of everything for myself, hoping the explanation
would be in your father's favor, and that I might do him justice. But,
on the contrary, the particulars which are given prove that Fernand
Mondego, raised by Ali Pasha to the rank of governor-general, is no
other than Count Fernand of Morcerf; then, recollecting the honor you
had done me, in admitting me to your friendship, I hastened to you."</p>

<p id="id08837">Albert, still extended on the chair, covered his face with both hands,
as if to prevent the light from reaching him. "I hastened to you,"
continued Beauchamp, "to tell you, Albert, that in this changing age,
the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children. Few have passed
through this revolutionary period, in the midst of which we were
born, without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the
soldier, or the gown of the magistrate. Now I have these proofs, Albert,
and I am in your confidence, no human power can force me to a duel which
your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal, but I come to
offer you what you can no longer demand of me. Do you wish these proofs,
these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed? Do you wish
this frightful secret to remain with us? Confided to me, it shall never
escape my lips; say, Albert, my friend, do you wish it?"</p>

<p id="id08838">Albert threw himself on Beauchamp's neck. "Ah, noble fellow!" cried he.</p>

<p id="id08839">"Take these," said Beauchamp, presenting the papers to Albert.</p>

<p id="id08840">Albert seized them with a convulsive hand, tore them in pieces, and
trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to
confront him, he approached the wax-light, always kept burning for
cigars, and burned every fragment. "Dear, excellent friend," murmured
Albert, still burning the papers.</p>

<p id="id08841">"Let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream," said Beauchamp; "let it
vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper, and disappear as the
smoke from those silent ashes."</p>

<p id="id08842">"Yes, yes," said Albert, "and may there remain only the eternal
friendship which I promised to my deliverer, which shall be transmitted
to our children's children, and shall always remind me that I owe my
life and the honor of my name to you,&#8212;for had this been known, oh,
Beauchamp, I should have destroyed myself; or,&#8212;no, my poor mother! I
could not have killed her by the same blow,&#8212;I should have fled from my
country."</p>

<p id="id08843">"Dear Albert," said Beauchamp. But this sudden and factitious joy soon
forsook the young man, and was succeeded by a still greater grief.</p>

<p id="id08844">"Well," said Beauchamp, "what still oppresses you, my friend?"</p>

<p id="id08845">"I am broken-hearted," said Albert. "Listen, Beauchamp! I cannot thus,
in a moment relinquish the respect, the confidence, and pride with which
a father's untarnished name inspires a son. Oh, Beauchamp, Beauchamp,
how shall I now approach mine? Shall I draw back my forehead from his
embrace, or withhold my hand from his? I am the most wretched of men.
Ah, my mother, my poor mother!" said Albert, gazing through his tears at
his mother's portrait; "if you know this, how much must you suffer!"</p>

<p id="id08846">"Come," said Beauchamp, taking both his hands, "take courage, my
friend."</p>

<p id="id08847">"But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal? Some
unknown enemy&#8212;an invisible foe&#8212;has done this."</p>

<p id="id08848">"The more must you fortify yourself, Albert. Let no trace of emotion be
visible on your countenance, bear your grief as the cloud bears within
it ruin and death&#8212;a fatal secret, known only when the storm bursts.
Go, my friend, reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall
come."</p>

<p id="id08849">"You think, then, all is not over yet?" said Albert, horror-stricken.</p>

<p id="id08850">"I think nothing, my friend; but all things are possible. By the way"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08851">"What?" said Albert, seeing that Beauchamp hesitated.</p>

<p id="id08852">"Are you going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?"</p>

<p id="id08853">"Why do you ask me now?"</p>

<p id="id08854">"Because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with
the person of whom we were speaking."</p>

<p id="id08855">"How?" said Albert, whose brow reddened; "you think M. Danglars"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id08856">"I ask you only how your engagement stands? Pray put no construction
on my words I do not mean they should convey, and give them no undue
weight."</p>

<p id="id08857">"No." said Albert, "the engagement is broken off."</p>

<p id="id08858">"Well," said Beauchamp. Then, seeing the young man was about to relapse
into melancholy, "Let us go out, Albert," said he; "a ride in the wood
in the phaeton, or on horseback, will refresh you; we will then return
to breakfast, and you shall attend to your affairs, and I to mine."</p>

<p id="id08859">"Willingly," said Albert; "but let us walk. I think a little exertion
would do me good." The two friends walked out on the fortress. When
arrived at the Madeleine,&#8212;"Since we are out," said Beauchamp, "let
us call on M. de Monte Cristo; he is admirably adapted to revive one's
spirits, because he never interrogates, and in my opinion those who ask
no questions are the best comforters."</p>

<p id="id08860">"Gladly," said Albert; "I love him&#8212;let us call."</p>
