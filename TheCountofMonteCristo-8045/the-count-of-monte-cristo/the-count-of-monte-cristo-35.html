<h2 id="id09930" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 99. The Law.</h2>

<p id="id09931">We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle
d'Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being
that every one was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think
of theirs. We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude
of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness,
who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which
had struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, Lucien Debray. The
baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her
of a guardianship which, over a girl of Eugenie's character, could not
fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations
which maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her
ascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom
and a type of perfection.</p>

<p id="id09932">Now, Madame Danglars feared Eugenie's sagacity and the influence of
Mademoiselle d'Armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous
expression with which her daughter looked upon Debray,&#8212;an expression
which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother's amorous and
pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she
saw that Eugenie detested Debray,&#8212;not only because he was a source of
dissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at
once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to
withdraw from the appellation of men, and whom Diogenes designated as
animals upon two legs without feathers.</p>

<p id="id09933">Unfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through
a certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as
others, and Madame Danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the
marriage of Eugenie had not taken place, not only because the match was
good, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it
would also set her at liberty. She ran therefore to Debray, who, after
having like the rest of Paris witnessed the contract scene and the
scandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was
chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of
conversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the
world.</p>

<p id="id09934">At the precise time when Madame Danglars, dressed in black and
concealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to Debray's
apartments,&#8212;notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that
the young man was not at home,&#8212;Debray was occupied in repelling the
insinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the
terrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the
family, to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions. Debray did
not defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed
his mind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of
Eugenie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the
same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in
his heart. Tea, play, and the conversation, which had become interesting
during the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till one o'clock
in the morning.</p>

<p id="id09935">Meanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of
Debray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers,
which she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed, Debray
had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was
half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.</p>

<p id="id09936">At twenty minutes of twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting, returned
home. Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one
respect, they seldom return home after twelve o'clock. The baroness
returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugenie used in leaving
it; she ran lightly up-stairs, and with an aching heart entered her
apartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of Eugenie. She was fearful
of exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter's innocence
and fidelity to the paternal roof. She listened at Eugenie's door, and
hearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place. Madame
Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the
terrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to sleep.
She called the maid and questioned her.</p>

<p id="id09937">"Mademoiselle Eugenie," said the maid, "retired to her apartment with
Mademoiselle d'Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they
desired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer." Since then
the maid had been below, and like every one else she thought the young
ladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore, went to bed
without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the recent events.
In proportion as her memory became clearer, the occurrences of the
evening were revealed in their true light; what she had taken for
confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as something distressing,
was in reality a disgrace. And then the baroness remembered that she had
felt no pity for poor Mercedes, who had been afflicted with as severe a
blow through her husband and son.</p>

<p id="id09938">"Eugenie," she said to herself, "is lost, and so are we. The affair, as
it will be reported, will cover us with shame; for in a society such as
ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound. How fortunate that
Eugenie is possessed of that strange character which has so often
made me tremble!" And her glance was turned towards heaven, where a
mysterious providence disposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even
a vice, sometimes produces a blessing. And then her thoughts, cleaving
through space like a bird in the air, rested on Cavalcanti. This Andrea
was a wretch, a robber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the
effects of a sort of education, if not a complete one; he had been
presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune,
supported by an honorable name. How could she extricate herself from
this labyrinth? To whom would she apply to help her out of this painful
situation? Debray, to whom she had run, with the first instinct of a
woman towards the man she loves, and who yet betrays her,&#8212;Debray could
but give her advice, she must apply to some one more powerful than he.</p>

<p id="id09939">The baroness then thought of M. de Villefort. It was M. de Villefort who
had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family, as though they
had been strangers. But, no; on reflection, the procureur was not a
merciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties, but
the friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the very
core of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the surgeon, who
wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious association
with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their
son-in-law. And since Villefort, the friend of Danglars, had acted in
this way, no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted
with, or had lent himself to, any of Andrea's intrigues. Villefort's
conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the baroness as
if shaped for their mutual advantage. But the inflexibility of the
procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and if she
could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she would, at
least, obtain all the indulgence he could allow. She would invoke
the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by the
remembrance of guilty, yet happy days. M. de Villefort would stifle the
affair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side, and allow Andrea to
fly, and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt
of court. And after this reasoning she slept easily.</p>

<p id="id09940">At nine o'clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her maid
or giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in the
same simple style as on the previous night; then running down-stairs,
she left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, called a cab, and
drove to M. de Villefort's house. For the last month this wretched house
had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the
plague. Some of the apartments were closed within and without; the
shutters were only opened to admit a minute's air, showing the scared
face of a footman, and immediately afterwards the window would be
closed, like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors
would say to each other in a low voice, "Will there be another funeral
to-day at the procureur's house?" Madame Danglars involuntarily
shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion; descending from the
cab, she approached the door with trembling knees, and rang the bell.
Three times did the bell ring with a dull, heavy sound, seeming to
participate, in the general sadness, before the concierge appeared and
peeped through the door, which he opened just wide enough to allow his
words to be heard. He saw a lady, a fashionable, elegantly dressed lady,
and yet the door remained almost closed.</p>

<p id="id09941">"Do you intend opening the door?" said the baroness.</p>

<p id="id09942">"First, madame, who are you?"</p>

<p id="id09943">"Who am I? You know me well enough."</p>

<p id="id09944">"We no longer know any one, madame."</p>

<p id="id09945">"You must be mad, my friend," said the baroness.</p>

<p id="id09946">"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p id="id09947">"Oh, this is too much!"</p>

<p id="id09948">"Madame, these are my orders; excuse me. Your name?"</p>

<p id="id09949">"The baroness Danglars; you have seen me twenty times."</p>

<p id="id09950">"Possibly, madame. And now, what do you want?"</p>

<p id="id09951">"Oh, how extraordinary! I shall complain to M. de Villefort of the
impertinence of his servants."</p>

<p id="id09952">"Madame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here
without an order from M. d'Avrigny, or without speaking to the
procureur."</p>

<p id="id09953">"Well, I have business with the procureur."</p>

<p id="id09954">"Is it pressing business?"</p>

<p id="id09955">"You can imagine so, since I have not even brought my carriage out yet.<br>

But enough of this&#8212;here is my card, take it to your master."<br></p>

<p id="id09956">"Madame will await my return?"</p>

<p id="id09957">"Yes; go." The concierge closed the door, leaving Madame Danglars in
the street. She had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was
opened wide enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was
again shut. Without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge
took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and
blew it. The valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps. "You will
excuse this poor fellow, madame," he said, as he preceded the baroness,
"but his orders are precise, and M. de Villefort begged me to tell you
that he could not act otherwise."</p>

<p id="id09958">In the court showing his merchandise, was a tradesman who had been
admitted with the same precautions. The baroness ascended the steps; she
felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify
her own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never lost sight
of her for an instant, she was introduced to the magistrate's study.
Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit,
the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so
insulting, that she began by complaining of it. But Villefort, raising
his head, bowed down by grief, looked up at her with so sad a smile that
her complaints died upon her lips. "Forgive my servants," he said, "for
a terror I cannot blame them for; from being suspected they have become
suspicious."</p>

<p id="id09959">Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate
alluded, but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never
have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far. "You too,
then, are unhappy?" she said. "Yes, madame," replied the magistrate.</p>

<p id="id09960">"Then you pity me!"</p>

<p id="id09961">"Sincerely, madame."</p>

<p id="id09962">"And you understand what brings me here?"</p>

<p id="id09963">"You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just
happened?"</p>

<p id="id09964">"Yes, sir,&#8212;a fearful misfortune."</p>

<p id="id09965">"You mean a mischance."</p>

<p id="id09966">"A mischance?" repeated the baroness.</p>

<p id="id09967">"Alas, madame," said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of
manner, "I consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable."</p>

<p id="id09968">"And do you suppose this will be forgotten?"</p>

<p id="id09969">"Everything will be forgotten, madame," said Villefort. "Your daughter
will be married to-morrow, if not to-day&#8212;in a week, if not to-morrow;
and I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your
daughter."</p>

<p id="id09970">Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort, stupefied to find him so almost
insultingly calm. "Am I come to a friend?" she asked in a tone full of
mournful dignity. "You know that you are, madame," said Villefort, whose
pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance. And
truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now
occupying the baroness and him. "Well, then, be more affectionate, my
dear Villefort," said the baroness. "Speak to me not as a magistrate,
but as a friend; and when I am in bitter anguish of spirit, do not tell
me that I ought to be gay." Villefort bowed. "When I hear misfortunes
named, madame," he said, "I have within the last few months contracted
the bad habit of thinking of my own, and then I cannot help drawing up
an egotistical parallel in my mind. That is the reason that by the side
of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances; that is why my
dreadful position makes yours appear enviable. But this annoys you; let
us change the subject. You were saying, madame"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id09971">"I came to ask you, my friend," said the baroness, "what will be done
with this impostor?"</p>

<p id="id09972">"Impostor," repeated Villefort; "certainly, madame, you appear to
extenuate some cases, and exaggerate others. Impostor, indeed!&#8212;M.
Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather M. Benedetto, is nothing more nor less than
an assassin!"</p>

<p id="id09973">"Sir, I do not deny the justice of your correction, but the more
severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man, the more deeply
will you strike our family. Come, forget him for a moment, and instead
of pursuing him let him go."</p>

<p id="id09974">"You are too late, madame; the orders are issued."</p>

<p id="id09975">"Well, should he be arrested&#8212;do they think they will arrest him?"</p>

<p id="id09976">"I hope so."</p>

<p id="id09977">"If they should arrest him (I know that sometimes prisoners afford means
of escape), will you leave him in prison?"&#8212;The procureur shook his
head. "At least keep him there till my daughter be married."</p>

<p id="id09978">"Impossible, madame; justice has its formalities."</p>

<p id="id09979">"What, even for me?" said the baroness, half jesting, half in earnest.<br>

"For all, even for myself among the rest," replied Villefort.<br></p>

<p id="id09980">"Ah," exclaimed the baroness, without expressing the ideas which the
exclamation betrayed. Villefort looked at her with that piercing glance
which reads the secrets of the heart. "Yes, I know what you mean," he
said; "you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world, that
the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months, and
from which Valentine has only escaped by a miracle, have not happened by
natural means."</p>

<p id="id09981">"I was not thinking of that," replied Madame Danglars quickly. "Yes, you
were thinking of it, and with justice. You could not help thinking of
it, and saying to yourself, 'you, who pursue crime so vindictively,
answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling?'" The
baroness became pale. "You were saying this, were you not?"</p>

<p id="id09982">"Well, I own it."</p>

<p id="id09983">"I will answer you."</p>

<p id="id09984">Villefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars; then resting both
hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual: "There
are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown,
and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but when the
culprits are discovered" (Villefort here extended his hand toward a
large crucifix placed opposite to his desk)&#8212;"when they are discovered,
I swear to you, by all I hold most sacred, that whoever they may be they
shall die. Now, after the oath I have just taken, and which I will keep,
madame, dare you ask for mercy for that wretch!"</p>

<p id="id09985">"But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?"</p>

<p id="id09986">"Listen; this is his description: 'Benedetto, condemned, at the age of
sixteen, for five years to the galleys for forgery.' He promised well,
as you see&#8212;first a runaway, then an assassin."</p>

<p id="id09987">"And who is this wretch?"</p>

<p id="id09988">"Who can tell?&#8212;a vagabond, a Corsican."</p>

<p id="id09989">"Has no one owned him?"</p>

<p id="id09990">"No one; his parents are unknown."</p>

<p id="id09991">"But who was the man who brought him from Lucca?"</p>

<p id="id09992">"Another rascal like himself, perhaps his accomplice." The baroness
clasped her hands. "Villefort," she exclaimed in her softest and most
captivating manner.</p>

<p id="id09993">"For heaven's sake, madame," said Villefort, with a firmness of
expression not altogether free from harshness&#8212;"for heaven's sake, do
not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch! What am I?&#8212;the law. Has the
law any eyes to witness your grief? Has the law ears to be melted by
your sweet voice? Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections
you endeavor to recall? No, madame; the law has commanded, and when it
commands it strikes. You will tell me that I am a living being, and not
a code&#8212;a man, and not a volume. Look at me, madame&#8212;look around me.
Have mankind treated me as a brother? Have they loved me? Have they
spared me? Has any one shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my
hands? No, madame, they struck me, always struck me!</p>

<p id="id09994">"Woman, siren that you are, do you persist in fixing on me that
fascinating eye, which reminds me that I ought to blush? Well, be it so;
let me blush for the faults you know, and perhaps&#8212;perhaps for even
more than those! But having sinned myself,&#8212;it may be more deeply
than others,&#8212;I never rest till I have torn the disguises from my
fellow-creatures, and found out their weaknesses. I have always found
them; and more,&#8212;I repeat it with joy, with triumph,&#8212;I have always
found some proof of human perversity or error. Every criminal I condemn
seems to me living evidence that I am not a hideous exception to the
rest. Alas, alas, alas; all the world is wicked; let us therefore strike
at wickedness!"</p>

<p id="id09995">Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage, which gave a
ferocious eloquence to his words.</p>

<p id="id09996">"But"' said Madame Danglars, resolving to make a last effort, "this
young man, though a murderer, is an orphan, abandoned by everybody."</p>

<p id="id09997">"So much the worse, or rather, so much the better; it has been so
ordained that he may have none to weep his fate."</p>

<p id="id09998">"But this is trampling on the weak, sir."</p>

<p id="id09999">"The weakness of a murderer!"</p>

<p id="id10000">"His dishonor reflects upon us."</p>

<p id="id10001">"Is not death in my house?"</p>

<p id="id10002">"Oh, sir," exclaimed the baroness, "you are without pity for others,
well, then, I tell you they will have no mercy on you!"</p>

<p id="id10003">"Be it so!" said Villefort, raising his arms to heaven.</p>

<p id="id10004">"At least, delay the trial till the next assizes; we shall then have six
months before us."</p>

<p id="id10005">"No, madame," said Villefort; "instructions have been given. There are
yet five days left; five days are more than I require. Do you not think
that I also long for forgetfulness? While working night and day, I
sometimes lose all recollection of the past, and then I experience the
same sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel; still, it is better
than suffering."</p>

<p id="id10006">"But, sir, he has fled; let him escape&#8212;inaction is a pardonable
offence."</p>

<p id="id10007">"I tell you it is too late; early this morning the telegraph was
employed, and at this very minute"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id10008">"Sir," said the valet de chambre, entering the room, "a dragoon has
brought this despatch from the minister of the interior." Villefort
seized the letter, and hastily broke the seal. Madame Danglars trembled
with fear; Villefort started with joy. "Arrested!" he exclaimed; "he
was taken at Compiegne, and all is over." Madame Danglars rose from her
seat, pale and cold. "Adieu, sir," she said. "Adieu, madame," replied
the king's attorney, as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to
the door. Then, turning to his desk, he said, striking the letter with
the back of his right hand, "Come, I had a forgery, three robberies, and
two cases of arson, I only wanted a murder, and here it is. It will be a
splendid session!"</p>

<h2 id="id10009" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 100. The Apparition.</h2>

<p id="id10010">As the procureur had told Madame Danglars, Valentine was not yet
recovered. Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;
and it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort,
that she heard all the strange events we have related,&#8212;we mean the
flight of Eugenie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather
Benedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against
him. But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced
the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of
health. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and confused
forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented themselves before
her eyes.</p>

<p id="id10011">During the daytime Valentine's perceptions remained tolerably clear,
owing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be
carried to his granddaughter's room, and watched her with his paternal
tenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,
frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child. At six
o'clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d'Avrigny himself
arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl, and
then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor's choice
succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o'clock, when
Valentine was asleep. As she went down-stairs she gave the keys of
Valentine's room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the
sick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little
Edward.</p>

<p id="id10012">Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,
and, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.
Certainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous
excitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him
when, half distracted, he had rushed to the count's house, that if
she were not dead in two hours she would be saved. Now four days had
elapsed, and Valentine still lived.</p>

<p id="id10013">The nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her
sleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking
hours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from
the alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass
and repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever
with their trembling wings. First she fancied she saw her stepmother
threatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes
mere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even
the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and
this state lasted till about three o'clock in the morning, when a deep,
heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake till
daylight. On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of
the flight of Eugenie and the arrest of Benedetto,&#8212;Villefort having
retired as well as Noirtier and d'Avrigny,&#8212;her thoughts wandered in a
confused maze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events
she had just heard.</p>

<p id="id10014">Eleven o'clock had struck. The nurse, having placed the beverage
prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient, and locked the
door, was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the
kitchen, and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had
for some months past amused the occupants of the ante-chambers in the
house of the king's attorney. Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing
in the room which had been so carefully locked. Ten minutes had elapsed
since the nurse had left; Valentine, who for the last hour had
been suffering from the fever which returned nightly, incapable of
controlling her ideas, was forced to yield to the excitement which
exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and
recurrence of the same fancies and images. The night-lamp threw out
countless rays, each resolving itself into some strange form to her
disordered imagination, when suddenly by its flickering light Valentine
thought she saw the door of her library, which was in the recess by the
chimney-piece, open slowly, though she in vain listened for the sound of
the hinges on which it turned.</p>

<p id="id10015">At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull
and summoned assistance, but nothing astonished her in her present
situation. Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but
the children of her imagination, and the conviction was strengthened
by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal
phantoms, who disappeared with the coming of daylight. From behind the
door a human figure appeared, but the girl was too familiar with
such apparitions to be alarmed, and therefore only stared, hoping to
recognize Morrel. The figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to
listen with profound attention. At this moment a ray of light glanced
across the face of the midnight visitor.</p>

<p id="id10016">"It is not he," she murmured, and waited, in the assurance that this was
but a dream, for the man to disappear or assume some other form. Still,
she felt her pulse, and finding it throb violently she remembered that
the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink, for a draught
of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to
cause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time she suffered less.
Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass, but as soon
as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly
towards her, and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied
she heard his breath, and felt the pressure of his hand.</p>

<p id="id10017">This time the illusion, or rather the reality, surpassed anything
Valentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really
alive and awake, and the belief that her reason was this time not
deceived made her shudder. The pressure she felt was evidently intended
to arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it. Then the figure, from
whom she could not detach her eyes, and who appeared more protecting
than menacing, took the glass, and walking towards the night-light held
it up, as if to test its transparency. This did not seem sufficient;
the man, or rather the ghost&#8212;for he trod so softly that no sound was
heard&#8212;then poured out about a spoonful into the glass, and drank it.
Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction. Every
minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another
vision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again
approached her, and said in an agitated voice, "Now you may drink."</p>

<p id="id10018">Valentine shuddered. It was the first time one of these visions had
ever addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an
exclamation. The man placed his finger on her lips. "The Count of Monte
Cristo!" she murmured.</p>

<p id="id10019">It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl's mind
as to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands
trembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her. Still, the
presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and
extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem
impossibilities to her shattered reason. "Do not call any one&#8212;do not be
alarmed," said the Count; "do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness
remain in your breast; the man standing before you, Valentine (for this
time it is no ghost), is nothing more than the tenderest father and the
most respectful friend you could dream of."</p>

<p id="id10020">Valentine could not reply; the voice which indicated the real presence
of a being in the room, alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a
syllable; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire, "If your
intentions are pure, why are you here?" The count's marvellous sagacity
understood all that was passing in the young girl's mind.</p>

<p id="id10021">"Listen to me," he said, "or, rather, look upon me; look at my face,
paler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness&#8212;for four days
I have not closed them, for I have been constantly watching you, to
protect and preserve you for Maximilian." The blood mounted rapidly
to the cheeks of Valentine, for the name just announced by the count
dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her.
"Maximilian!" she exclaimed, and so sweet did the sound appear to her,
that she repeated it&#8212;"Maximilian!&#8212;has he then owned all to you?"</p>

<p id="id10022">"Everything. He told me your life was his, and I have promised him that
you shall live."</p>

<p id="id10023">"You have promised him that I shall live?"</p>

<p id="id10024">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id10025">"But, sir, you spoke of vigilance and protection. Are you a doctor?"</p>

<p id="id10026">"Yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me."</p>

<p id="id10027">"But you say you have watched?" said Valentine uneasily; "where have
you been?&#8212;I have not seen you." The count extended his hand towards the
library. "I was hidden behind that door," he said, "which leads into the
next house, which I have rented." Valentine turned her eyes away, and,
with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear, exclaimed: "Sir,
I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and that what
you call protection is more like an insult."</p>

<p id="id10028">"Valentine," he answered, "during my long watch over you, all I
have observed has been what people visited you, what nourishment was
prepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared
dangerous to me, I entered, as I have now done, and substituted, in the
place of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing
the death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins."</p>

<p id="id10029">"Poison&#8212;death!" exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the
influence of some feverish hallucination; "what are you saying, sir?"</p>

<p id="id10030">"Hush, my child," said Monte Cristo, again placing his finger upon her
lips, "I did say poison and death. But drink some of this;" and the
count took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which
he poured a few drops into the glass. "Drink this, and then take nothing
more to-night." Valentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she
touched the glass when she drew back in fear. Monte Cristo took the
glass, drank half its contents, and then presented it to Valentine, who
smiled and swallowed the rest. "Oh, yes," she exclaimed, "I recognize
the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much, and
seemed to ease my aching brain. Thank you, sir, thank you!"</p>

<p id="id10031">"This is how you have lived during the last four nights, Valentine,"
said the count. "But, oh, how I passed that time! Oh, the wretched hours
I have endured&#8212;the torture to which I have submitted when I saw the
deadly poison poured into your glass, and how I trembled lest you should
drink it before I could find time to throw it away!"</p>

<p id="id10032">"Sir," said Valentine, at the height of her terror, "you say you endured
tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass; but if you
saw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?"</p>

<p id="id10033">"Yes." Valentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which
appeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with the
cold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror. "You saw
the person?" repeated the young girl. "Yes," repeated the count.</p>

<p id="id10034">"What you tell me is horrible, sir. You wish to make me believe
something too dreadful. What?&#8212;attempt to murder me in my father's
house, in my room, on my bed of sickness? Oh, leave me, sir; you
are tempting me&#8212;you make me doubt the goodness of providence&#8212;it is
impossible, it cannot be!"</p>

<p id="id10035">"Are you the first that this hand has stricken? Have you not seen
M. de Saint-Meran, Madame de Saint-Meran, Barrois, all fall? Would not
M. Noirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has
been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the
poison?"</p>

<p id="id10036">"Oh, heaven," said Valentine; "is this the reason why grandpapa has made
me share all his beverages during the last month?"</p>

<p id="id10037">"And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of
dried orange-peel?"</p>

<p id="id10038">"Oh, yes, yes!"</p>

<p id="id10039">"Then that explains all," said Monte Cristo. "Your grandfather knows,
then, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.
He has been fortifying you, his beloved child, against the fatal
effects of the poison, which has failed because your system was already
impregnated with it. But even this would have availed little against a
more deadly medium of death employed four days ago, which is generally
but too fatal."</p>

<p id="id10040">"But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?"</p>

<p id="id10041">"Let me also ask you a question. Have you never seen any one enter your
room at night?"</p>

<p id="id10042">"Oh, yes; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach,
and disappear; but I took them for visions raised by my feverish
imagination, and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the
influence of delirium."</p>

<p id="id10043">"Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?"</p>

<p id="id10044">"No," said Valentine; "who could desire my death?"</p>

<p id="id10045">"You shall know it now, then," said Monte Cristo, listening.</p>

<p id="id10046">"How do you mean?" said Valentine, looking anxiously around.</p>

<p id="id10047">"Because you are not feverish or delirious to-night, but thoroughly
awake; midnight is striking, which is the hour murderers choose."</p>

<p id="id10048">"Oh, heavens," exclaimed Valentine, wiping off the drops which ran down
her forehead. Midnight struck slowly and sadly; every hour seemed to
strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl. "Valentine,"
said the count, "summon up all your courage; still the beatings of your
heart; do not let a sound escape you, and feign to be asleep; then you
will see." Valentine seized the count's hand. "I think I hear a noise,"
she said; "leave me."</p>

<p id="id10049">"Good-by, for the present," replied the count, walking upon tiptoe
towards the library door, and smiling with an expression so sad and
paternal that the young girl's heart was filled with gratitude.
Before closing the door he turned around once more, and said, "Not a
movement&#8212;not a word; let them think you asleep, or perhaps you may be
killed before I have the power of helping you." And with this fearful
injunction the count disappeared through the door, which noiselessly
closed after him.</p>

<h2 id="id10050" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 101. Locusta.</h2>

<p id="id10051">Valentine was alone; two other clocks, slower than that of
Saint-Philippe du Roule, struck the hour of midnight from different
directions, and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was
silent. Then Valentine's attention was engrossed by the clock in her
room, which marked the seconds. She began counting them, remarking that
they were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she
doubted,&#8212;the inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that any one
should desire her death. Why should they? To what end? What had she
done to excite the malice of an enemy? There was no fear of her falling
asleep. One terrible idea pressed upon her mind,&#8212;that some one existed
in the world who had attempted to assassinate her, and who was about
to endeavor to do so again. Supposing this person, wearied at the
inefficacy of the poison, should, as Monte Cristo intimated, have
recourse to steel!&#8212;What if the count should have no time to run to her
rescue!&#8212;What if her last moments were approaching, and she should never
again see Morrel! When this terrible chain of ideas presented itself,
Valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell, and call for help. But
through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count&#8212;that
eye which lived in her memory, and the recollection overwhelmed her with
so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude
could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship.</p>

<p id="id10052">Twenty minutes, twenty tedious minutes, passed thus, then ten more,
and at last the clock struck the half-hour. Just then the sound of
finger-nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed
Valentine that the count was still watching, and recommended her to
do the same; at the same time, on the opposite side, that is towards
Edward's room, Valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the
floor; she listened attentively, holding her breath till she was nearly
suffocated; the lock turned, and the door slowly opened. Valentine had
raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely time to throw herself
down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm; then, trembling,
agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable terror, she awaited
the event.</p>

<p id="id10053">Some one approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine
summoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which
announces tranquil sleep. "Valentine!" said a low voice. Still silent:
Valentine had promised not to awake. Then everything was still,
excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid
being poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she ventured to
open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw a woman in a
white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass. During
this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some
slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the
bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept&#8212;it was
Madame de Villefort.</p>

<p id="id10054">On recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder,
which caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly
stepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains,
she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of
Valentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo;
she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp
knife. Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself to
close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs
of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost impossible
at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid
open and learn the truth. Madame de Villefort, however, reassured by
the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of
Valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the curtains
succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass. Then she
retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the room. She
only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm&#8212;the fair round arm of a woman
but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread death around her.</p>

<p id="id10055">It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine
during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.
The grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from
the stupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to
insensibility. She raised her head with an effort. The noiseless door
again turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.
"Well," said he, "do you still doubt?"</p>

<p id="id10056">"Oh," murmured the young girl.</p>

<p id="id10057">"Have you seen?"</p>

<p id="id10058">"Alas!"</p>

<p id="id10059">"Did you recognize?" Valentine groaned. "Oh, yes;" she said, "I saw, but<br>

I cannot believe!"<br></p>

<p id="id10060">"Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian's death?"</p>

<p id="id10061">"Oh," repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, "can I not leave the
house?&#8212;can I not escape?"</p>

<p id="id10062">"Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere;
your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be offered to
you disguised in every shape. You will find it in the water you drink
from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree."</p>

<p id="id10063">"But did you not say that my kind grandfather's precaution had
neutralized the poison?"</p>

<p id="id10064">"Yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and the
quantity increased." He took the glass and raised it to his lips. "It
is already done," he said; "brucine is no longer employed, but a simple
narcotic! I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been
dissolved. If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has poured into
your glass, Valentine&#8212;Valentine&#8212;you would have been doomed!"</p>

<p id="id10065">"But," exclaimed the young girl, "why am I thus pursued?"</p>

<p id="id10066">"Why?&#8212;are you so kind&#8212;so good&#8212;so unsuspicious of ill, that you cannot
understand, Valentine?"</p>

<p id="id10067">"No, I have never injured her."</p>

<p id="id10068">"But you are rich, Valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and you
prevent her son from enjoying these 200,000. livres."</p>

<p id="id10069">"How so? The fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my
relations."</p>

<p id="id10070">"Certainly; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Meran have died; that
is why M. Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir; that
is why you, in your turn, are to die&#8212;it is because your father would
inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to his."</p>

<p id="id10071">"Edward? Poor child! Are all these crimes committed on his account?"</p>

<p id="id10072">"Ah, then you at length understand?"</p>

<p id="id10073">"Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!"</p>

<p id="id10074">"Valentine, you are an angel!"</p>

<p id="id10075">"But why is my grandfather allowed to live?"</p>

<p id="id10076">"It was considered, that you dead, the fortune would naturally revert
to your brother, unless he were disinherited; and besides, the crime
appearing useless, it would be folly to commit it."</p>

<p id="id10077">"And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been
invented by a woman?"</p>

<p id="id10078">"Do you recollect in the arbor of the Hotel des Postes, at Perugia,
seeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning
upon aqua tofana? Well, ever since then, the infernal project has been
ripening in her brain."</p>

<p id="id10079">"Ah, then, indeed, sir," said the sweet girl, bathed in tears, "I see
that I am condemned to die!"</p>

<p id="id10080">"No, Valentine, for I have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy is
conquered since we know her, and you will live, Valentine&#8212;live to
be happy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to
insure this you must rely on me."</p>

<p id="id10081">"Command me, sir&#8212;what am I to do?"</p>

<p id="id10082">"You must blindly take what I give you."</p>

<p id="id10083">"Alas, were it only for my own sake, I should prefer to die!"</p>

<p id="id10084">"You must not confide in any one&#8212;not even in your father."</p>

<p id="id10085">"My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?" asked<br>

Valentine, clasping her hands.<br></p>

<p id="id10086">"No; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations,
ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally;
it is he who should have watched over you&#8212;he should have occupied my
place&#8212;he should have emptied that glass&#8212;he should have risen against
the assassin. Spectre against spectre!" he murmured in a low voice, as
he concluded his sentence.</p>

<p id="id10087">"Sir," said Valentine, "I will do all I can to live, for there are
two beings whose existence depends upon mine&#8212;my grandfather and
Maximilian."</p>

<p id="id10088">"I will watch over them as I have over you."</p>

<p id="id10089">"Well, sir, do as you will with me;" and then she added, in a low voice,
"oh, heavens, what will befall me?"</p>

<p id="id10090">"Whatever may happen, Valentine, do not be alarmed; though you suffer;
though you lose sight, hearing, consciousness, fear nothing; though
you should awake and be ignorant where you are, still do not fear;
even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin.
Reassure yourself, then, and say to yourself: 'At this moment, a friend,
a father, who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian, watches
over me!'"</p>

<p id="id10091">"Alas, alas, what a fearful extremity!"</p>

<p id="id10092">"Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?"</p>

<p id="id10093">"I would rather die a hundred times&#8212;oh, yes, die!"</p>

<p id="id10094">"No, you will not die; but will you promise me, whatever happens, that
you will not complain, but hope?"</p>

<p id="id10095">"I will think of Maximilian!"</p>

<p id="id10096">"You are my own darling child, Valentine! I alone can save you, and I
will." Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,&#8212;for
she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage,&#8212;and began to
pray, and while uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot
that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair, and
that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her
nightdress. Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl's arm,
drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat, and said with a paternal
smile,&#8212;"My child, believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the
goodness of providence and the love of Maximilian."</p>

<p id="id10097">Then he drew from his waistcoat-pocket the little emerald box, raised
the golden lid, and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea,
which he placed in her hand. She took it, and looked attentively on the
count; there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector
which commanded her veneration. She evidently interrogated him by her
look. "Yes," said he. Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and
swallowed it. "And now, my dear child, adieu for the present. I will try
and gain a little sleep, for you are saved."</p>

<p id="id10098">"Go," said Valentine, "whatever happens, I promise you not to fear."</p>

<p id="id10099">Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who
gradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the
count had given her. Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the
contents in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had taken
it, and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after throwing
a farewell glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence and
innocence of an angel.</p>

<h2 id="id10100" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 102. Valentine.</h2>

<p id="id10101">The night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the
last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water. The globe
of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue, and the flame, brightening before
it expired, threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object
have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in
its final agonies. A dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes
and curtains surrounding the young girl. All noise in the streets had
ceased, and the silence was frightful. It was then that the door of
Edward's room opened, and a head we have before noticed appeared in
the glass opposite; it was Madame de Villefort, who came to witness
the effects of the drink she had prepared. She stopped in the doorway,
listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp, the only sound in
that deserted room, and then advanced to the table to see if Valentine's
glass were empty. It was still about a quarter full, as we before
stated. Madame de Villefort emptied the contents into the ashes, which
she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid; then
she carefully rinsed the glass, and wiping it with her handkerchief
replaced it on the table.</p>

<p id="id10102">If any one could have looked into the room just then he would have
noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed
and looked fixedly on Valentine. The dim light, the profound silence,
and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour, and still more by her own
conscience, all combined to produce a sensation of fear; the poisoner
was terrified at the contemplation of her own work. At length she
rallied, drew aside the curtain, and leaning over the pillow gazed
intently on Valentine. The young girl no longer breathed, no breath
issued through the half-closed teeth; the white lips no longer
quivered&#8212;the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor, and the long black
lashes rested on a cheek white as wax. Madame de Villefort gazed upon
the face so expressive even in its stillness; then she ventured to raise
the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl's heart. It was
cold and motionless. She only felt the pulsation in her own fingers, and
withdrew her hand with a shudder. One arm was hanging out of the bed;
from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of Germain
Pillon's "Graces," [*] but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly distorted
by convulsion, and the hand, so delicately formed, was resting with
stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed. The nails, too,
were turning blue.</p>

<p id="id10103">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;* Germain Pillon was a famous French sculptor (1535-1598).<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His best known work is "The Three Graces," now in the<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Louvre.<br></p>

<p id="id10104">Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt; all was over&#8212;she had
consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish. There was no
more to do in the room, so the poisoner retired stealthily, as though
fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps; but as she withdrew she
still held aside the curtain, absorbed in the irresistible attraction
always exerted by the picture of death, so long as it is merely
mysterious and does not excite disgust. Just then the lamp again
flickered; the noise startled Madame de Villefort, who shuddered and
dropped the curtain. Immediately afterwards the light expired, and the
room was plunged in frightful obscurity, while the clock at that
minute struck half-past four. Overpowered with agitation, the poisoner
succeeded in groping her way to the door, and reached her room in an
agony of fear.</p>

<p id="id10105">The darkness lasted two hours longer; then by degrees a cold light crept
through the Venetian blinds, until at length it revealed the objects in
the room. About this time the nurse's cough was heard on the stairs and
the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand. To the tender eye
of a father or a lover, the first glance would have sufficed to reveal
Valentine's condition; but to this hireling, Valentine only appeared to
sleep. "Good," she exclaimed, approaching the table, "she has taken part
of her draught; the glass is three-quarters empty."</p>

<p id="id10106">Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire, and although she
had just left her bed, she could not resist the temptation offered by
Valentine's sleep, so she threw herself into an arm-chair to snatch a
little more rest. The clock striking eight awoke her. Astonished at the
prolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm was
still hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and for
the first time noticed the white lips. She tried to replace the arm, but
it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick-nurse.
She screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed,&#8212;"Help, help!"</p>

<p id="id10107">"What is the matter?" asked M. d'Avrigny, at the foot of the stairs, it
being the hour he usually visited her.</p>

<p id="id10108">"What is it?" asked Villefort, rushing from his room. "Doctor, do you
hear them call for help?"</p>

<p id="id10109">"Yes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in Valentine's room." But before the
doctor and the father could reach the room, the servants who were on the
same floor had entered, and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her
bed, they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed, as
though struck by lightening. "Call Madame de Villefort!&#8212;Wake Madame
de Villefort!" cried the procureur from the door of his chamber, which
apparently he scarcely dared to leave. But instead of obeying him, the
servants stood watching M. d'Avrigny, who ran to Valentine, and raised
her in his arms. "What?&#8212;this one, too?" he exclaimed. "Oh, where will
be the end?" Villefort rushed into the room. "What are you saying,
doctor?" he exclaimed, raising his hands to heaven.</p>

<p id="id10110">"I say that Valentine is dead!" replied d'Avrigny, in a voice terrible
in its solemn calm.</p>

<p id="id10111">M. de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed. On the
exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father, the servants all
fled with muttered imprecations; they were heard running down the stairs
and through the long passages, then there was a rush in the court,
afterwards all was still; they had, one and all, deserted the accursed
house. Just then, Madame de Villefort, in the act of slipping on
her dressing-gown, threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood
motionless, as though interrogating the occupants of the room, while she
endeavored to call up some rebellious tears. On a sudden she stepped,
or rather bounded, with outstretched arms, towards the table. She saw
d'Avrigny curiously examining the glass, which she felt certain of
having emptied during the night. It was now a third full, just as it
was when she threw the contents into the ashes. The spectre of Valentine
rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less. It was, indeed,
the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass, and which
Valentine had drunk}; it was indeed the poison, which could not deceive
M. d'Avrigny, which he now examined so closely; it was doubtless a
miracle from heaven, that, notwithstanding her precautions, there should
be some trace, some proof remaining to reveal the crime. While Madame
de Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror, and
Villefort, with his head hidden in the bedclothes, saw nothing around
him, d'Avrigny approached the window, that he might the better examine
the contents of the glass, and dipping the tip of his finger in, tasted
it. "Ah," he exclaimed, "it is no longer brucine that is used; let me
see what it is!"</p>

<p id="id10112">Then he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentine's room, which had been
transformed into a medicine closet, and taking from its silver case a
small bottle of nitric acid, dropped a little of it into the liquor,
which immediately changed to a blood-red color. "Ah," exclaimed
d'Avrigny, in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth
was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery. Madame
de Villefort was overpowered, her eyes first flashed and then swam,
she staggered towards the door and disappeared. Directly afterwards the
distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard, but
no one paid any attention to it; the nurse was engaged in watching
the chemical analysis, and Villefort was still absorbed in grief. M.
d'Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes, and
watched her hurried retreat. He lifted up the drapery over the entrance
to Edward's room, and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villefort's
apartment, he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor. "Go to the
assistance of Madame de Villefort," he said to the nurse. "Madame de
Villefort is ill."</p>

<p id="id10113">"But Mademoiselle de Villefort"&#8212;stammered the nurse.</p>

<p id="id10114">"Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help," said d'Avrigny,
"since she is dead."</p>

<p id="id10115">"Dead,&#8212;dead!" groaned forth Villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which
was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron
heart of that man.</p>

<p id="id10116">"Dead!" repeated a third voice. "Who said Valentine was dead?"</p>

<p id="id10117">The two men turned round, and saw Morrel standing at the door, pale and
terror-stricken. This is what had happened. At the usual time, Morrel
had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtier's room.
Contrary to custom, the door was open, and having no occasion to ring he
entered. He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to
conduct him to M. Noirtier; but no one answered, the servants having,
as we know, deserted the house. Morrel had no particular reason for
uneasiness; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live,
and so far he had always fulfilled his word. Every night the count had
given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by Noirtier. Still
this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him, and he called a
second and third time; still no answer. Then he determined to go up.
Noirtier's room was opened, like all the rest. The first thing he saw
was the old man sitting in his arm-chair in his usual place, but his
eyes expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread
his features.</p>

<p id="id10118">"How are you, sir?" asked Morrel, with a sickness of heart.</p>

<p id="id10119">"Well," answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance
manifested increasing uneasiness.</p>

<p id="id10120">"You are thoughtful, sir," continued Morrel; "you want something; shall<br>

I call one of the servants?"<br></p>

<p id="id10121">"Yes," replied Noirtier.</p>

<p id="id10122">Morrel pulled the bell, but though he nearly broke the cord no one
answered. He turned towards Noirtier; the pallor and anguish expressed
on his countenance momentarily increased.</p>

<p id="id10123">"Oh," exclaimed Morrel, "why do they not come? Is any one ill in the
house?" The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from
their sockets. "What is the matter? You alarm me. Valentine? Valentine?"</p>

<p id="id10124">"Yes, yes," signed Noirtier. Maximilian tried to speak, but he could
articulate nothing; he staggered, and supported himself against the
wainscot. Then he pointed to the door.</p>

<p id="id10125">"Yes, yes, yes!" continued the old man. Maximilian rushed up the little
staircase, while Noirtier's eyes seemed to say,&#8212;"Quicker, quicker!"</p>

<p id="id10126">In a minute the young man darted through several rooms, till at length
he reached Valentine's. There was no occasion to push the door, it was
wide open. A sob was the only sound he heard. He saw as though in a
mist, a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white
drapery. A terrible fear transfixed him. It was then he heard a voice
exclaim "Valentine is dead!" and another voice which, like an echo
repeated,&#8212;"Dead,&#8212;dead!"</p>

<h2 id="id10127" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 103. Maximilian.</h2>

<p id="id10128">Villefort rose, half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm
of grief. The terrible office he had held for twenty-five years had
succeeded in making him more or less than man. His glance, at first
wandering, fixed itself upon Morrel. "Who are you, sir," he asked, "that
forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death?
Go, sir, go!" But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his
eyes from that disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl
who was lying on it. "Go!&#8212;do you hear?" said Villefort, while d'Avrigny
advanced to lead Morrel out. Maximilian stared for a moment at the
corpse, gazed all around the room, then upon the two men; he opened
his mouth to speak, but finding it impossible to give utterance to the
innumerable ideas that occupied his brain, he went out, thrusting his
hands through his hair in such a manner that Villefort and d'Avrigny,
for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic, exchanged glances,
which seemed to say,&#8212;"He is mad!"</p>

<p id="id10129">But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an
extraordinary weight. Morrel was seen carrying, with superhuman
strength, the arm-chair containing Noirtier up-stairs. When he reached
the landing he placed the arm-chair on the floor and rapidly rolled it
into Valentine's room. This could only have been accomplished by means
of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement. But the most
fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed, his face
expressing all his meaning, and his eyes supplying the want of every
other faculty. That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort
like a frightful apparition. Each time he had been brought into contact
with his father, something terrible had happened. "See what they have
done!" cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on the back of the chair, and
the other extended towards Valentine. "See, my father, see!"</p>

<p id="id10130">Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who,
almost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father. At this moment
the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became
bloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples
became purple, as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was
wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry. And the cry issued
from his pores, if we may thus speak&#8212;a cry frightful in its silence.
D'Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful
restorative.</p>

<p id="id10131">"Sir," cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic, "they ask
me who I am, and what right I have to be here. Oh, you know it, tell
them, tell them!" And the young man's voice was choked by sobs. As for
the old man, his chest heaved with his panting respiration. One could
have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death. At
length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping, tears
glistened in the eyes of Noirtier. "Tell them," said Morrel in a hoarse
voice, "tell them that I am her betrothed. Tell them she was my beloved,
my noble girl, my only blessing in the world. Tell them&#8212;oh, tell them,
that corpse belongs to me!"</p>

<p id="id10132">The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish, fell heavily
on his knees before the bed, which his fingers grasped with convulsive
energy. D'Avrigny, unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion,
turned away; and Villefort, without seeking any further explanation,
and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us
towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn, extended his
hand towards the young man. But Morrel saw nothing; he had grasped the
hand of Valentine, and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as
he bit the sheets. For some time nothing was heard in that chamber but
sobs, exclamations, and prayers. At length Villefort, the most composed
of all, spoke: "Sir," said he to Maximilian, "you say you loved
Valentine, that you were betrothed to her. I knew nothing of this
engagement, of this love, yet I, her father, forgive you, for I see that
your grief is real and deep; and besides my own sorrow is too great for
anger to find a place in my heart. But you see that the angel whom
you hoped for has left this earth&#8212;she has nothing more to do with the
adoration of men. Take a last farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take
the hand you expected to possess once more within your own, and then
separate yourself from her forever. Valentine now requires only the
ministrations of the priest."</p>

<p id="id10133">"You are mistaken, sir," exclaimed Morrel, raising himself on one knee,
his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt&#8212;"you
are mistaken; Valentine, dying as she has, not only requires a priest,
but an avenger. You, M. de Villefort, send for the priest; I will be the
avenger."</p>

<p id="id10134">"What do you mean, sir?" asked Villefort, trembling at the new idea
inspired by the delirium of Morrel.</p>

<p id="id10135">"I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned
sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office."</p>

<p id="id10136">The eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d'Avrigny approached.</p>

<p id="id10137">"Gentlemen," said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of
the witnesses to the scene, "I know what I am saying, and you know as
well as I do what I am about to say&#8212;Valentine has been assassinated!"
Villefort hung his head, d'Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said
"Yes" with his eyes. "Now, sir," continued Morrel, "in these days no one
can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to
the cause of her disappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful,
and adorable creature like Valentine. Mr. Procureur," said Morrel with
increasing vehemence, "no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it
is your place to seek the assassin." The young man's implacable eyes
interrogated Villefort, who, on his side, glanced from Noirtier to
d'Avrigny. But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor
and his father, he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of
Maximilian. "Yes," indicated the old man.</p>

<p id="id10138">"Assuredly," said d'Avrigny.</p>

<p id="id10139">"Sir," said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force
and his own emotion,&#8212;"sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes
here. I am stricken by fate. It is horrible, indeed, but no one
assassinates."</p>

<p id="id10140">The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d'Avrigny prepared to
speak. Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence. "And I
say that murders are committed here," said Morrel, whose voice, though
lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: "I tell you
that this is the fourth victim within the last four months. I tell
you, Valentine's life was attempted by poison four days ago, though she
escaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier. I tell you that the
dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has
succeeded. I tell you that you know these things as well as I do, since
this gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a friend."</p>

<p id="id10141">"Oh, you rave, sir," exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape
the net in which he was taken.</p>

<p id="id10142">"I rave?" said Morrel; "well, then, I appeal to M. d'Avrigny himself.
Ask him, sir, if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of
this house on the night of Madame de Saint-Meran's death. You thought
yourselves alone, and talked about that tragical death, and the
fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder
of Valentine." Villefort and d'Avrigny exchanged looks. "Yes, yes,"
continued Morrel; "recall the scene, for the words you thought were
only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears. Certainly, after
witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by M. de Villefort towards
his own relations, I ought to have denounced him to the authorities;
then I should not have been an accomplice to thy death, as I now am,
sweet, beloved Valentine; but the accomplice shall become the avenger.
This fourth murder is apparent to all, and if thy father abandon thee,
Valentine, it is I, and I swear it, that shall pursue the assassin."
And this time, as though nature had at least taken compassion on the
vigorous frame, nearly bursting with its own strength, the words of
Morrel were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears, so long
rebellious, gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on his
knees by the side of the bed.</p>

<p id="id10143">Then d'Avrigny spoke. "And I, too," he exclaimed in a low voice, "I
unite with M. Morrel in demanding justice for crime; my blood boils at
the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession."</p>

<p id="id10144">"Oh, merciful heavens!" murmured Villefort. Morrel raised his head,
and reading the eyes of the old man, which gleamed with unnatural
lustre,&#8212;"Stay," he said, "M. Noirtier wishes to speak."</p>

<p id="id10145">"Yes," indicated Noirtier, with an expression the more terrible, from
all his faculties being centred in his glance.</p>

<p id="id10146">"Do you know the assassin?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id10147">"Yes," replied Noirtier.</p>

<p id="id10148">"And will you direct us?" exclaimed the young man. "Listen, M.
d'Avrigny, listen!" Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those
melancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy, and thus
fixed his attention. Then, having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor
on his own, he glanced towards the door.</p>

<p id="id10149">"Do you wish me to leave?" said Morrel, sadly.</p>

<p id="id10150">"Yes," replied Noirtier.</p>

<p id="id10151">"Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!"</p>

<p id="id10152">The old man's eyes remained fixed on the door.</p>

<p id="id10153">"May I, at least, return?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id10154">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id10155">"Must I leave alone?"</p>

<p id="id10156">"No."</p>

<p id="id10157">"Whom am I to take with me? The procureur?"</p>

<p id="id10158">"No."</p>

<p id="id10159">"The doctor?"</p>

<p id="id10160">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id10161">"You wish to remain alone with M. de Villefort?"</p>

<p id="id10162">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id10163">"But can he understand you?"</p>

<p id="id10164">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id10165">"Oh," said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the
inquiries were to be made by him alone,&#8212;"oh, be satisfied, I can
understand my father." D'Avrigny took the young man's arm, and led
him out of the room. A more than deathlike silence then reigned in
the house. At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep
was heard, and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where
d'Avrigny and Morrel had been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the
other in grief. "You can come," he said, and led them back to Noirtier.
Morrel looked attentively on Villefort. His face was livid, large drops
rolled down his face, and in his fingers he held the fragments of a
quill pen which he had torn to atoms.</p>

<p id="id10166">"Gentlemen," he said in a hoarse voice, "give me your word of honor that
this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves!" The
two men drew back.</p>

<p id="id10167">"I entreat you."&#8212;continued Villefort.</p>

<p id="id10168">"But," said Morrel, "the culprit&#8212;the murderer&#8212;the assassin."</p>
