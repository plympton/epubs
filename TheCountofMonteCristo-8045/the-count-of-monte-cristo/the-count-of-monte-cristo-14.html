<p id="id03773">"My dear Franz," replied Albert, "when, upon receipt of my letter, you
found the necessity of asking the count's assistance, you promptly went
to him, saying, 'My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to
deliver him.' Was not that nearly what you said?"</p>

<p id="id03774">"It was."</p>

<p id="id03775">"Well, then, did he ask you, 'Who is M. Albert de Morcerf? how does he
come by his name&#8212;his fortune? what are his means of existence? what is
his birthplace! of what country is he a native?' Tell me, did he put all
these questions to you?"</p>

<p id="id03776">"I confess he asked me none."</p>

<p id="id03777">"No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where,
I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and
unconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain. Now, then, Franz,
when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he but asks
me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince
or Italian nobleman who may pass through Paris&#8212;merely to introduce him
into society&#8212;would you have me refuse? My good fellow, you must have
lost your senses to think it possible I could act with such cold-blooded
policy." And this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual
state of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective
arguments were all on Albert's side.</p>

<p id="id03778">"Well," said Franz with a sigh, "do as you please my dear viscount, for
your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation. Still, in spite of
all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular
personage."</p>

<p id="id03779">"He is a philanthropist," answered the other; "and no doubt his motive
in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you
are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced
the interests of virtue and humanity. If my vote and interest can obtain
it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other. And
now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else. Come, shall we take
our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter's?" Franz silently
assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five o'clock,
the young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and
Franz d'Epinay to pass a fortnight at Venice. But, ere he entered his
travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might
forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a
waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo,
on which, beneath the name of Vicomte Albert de Morcerf, he had written
in pencil&#8212;"27, Rue du Helder, on the 21st May, half-past ten A.M."</p>

<h2 id="id03780" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 39. The Guests.</h2>

<p id="id03781">In the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of
Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the
21st of May to do honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a
pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite
another building, in which were the servants' apartments. Two windows
only of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into
the court, and two at the back into the garden. Between the court and
the garden, built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture, was
the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcerf.
A high wall surrounded the whole of the hotel, surmounted at intervals
by vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a large gate
of gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance. A small door,
close to the lodge of the concierge, gave ingress and egress to the
servants and masters when they were on foot.</p>

<p id="id03782">It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother, unwilling to
part from her son, and yet aware that a young man of the viscount's age
required the full exercise of his liberty, had chosen this habitation
for Albert. There were not lacking, however, evidences of what we may
call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent,
careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in a gilded cage.
By means of the two windows looking into the street, Albert could see
all that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young
men, who always want to see the world traverse their horizon, even if
that horizon is only a public thoroughfare. Then, should anything appear
to merit a more minute examination, Albert de Morcerf could follow up
his researches by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the
concierge's door, and which merits a particular description. It was a
little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house
was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the
well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. This door was a
mockery to the concierge, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was
free, and, like that famous portal in the "Arabian Nights," opening at
the "Sesame" of Ali Baba, it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic
word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest
fingers in the world. At the end of a long corridor, with which the
door communicated, and which formed the ante-chamber, was, on the right,
Albert's breakfast-room, looking into the court, and on the left the
salon, looking into the garden. Shrubs and creeping plants covered the
windows, and hid from the garden and court these two apartments, the
only rooms into which, as they were on the ground-floor, the prying eyes
of the curious could penetrate. On the floor above were similar rooms,
with the addition of a third, formed out of the ante-chamber;
these three rooms were a salon, a boudoir, and a bedroom. The salon
down-stairs was only an Algerian divan, for the use of smokers. The
boudoir up-stairs communicated with the bed-chamber by an invisible door
on the staircase; it was evident that every precaution had been taken.
Above this floor was a large atelier, which had been increased in size
by pulling down the partitions&#8212;a pandemonium, in which the artist and
the dandy strove for preeminence. There were collected and piled up all
Albert's successive caprices, hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes&#8212;a whole
orchestra, for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music; easels,
palettes, brushes, pencils&#8212;for music had been succeeded by painting;
foils, boxing-gloves, broadswords, and single-sticks&#8212;for, following
the example of the fashionable young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf
cultivated, with far more perseverance than music and drawing, the
three arts that complete a dandy's education, i.e., fencing, boxing,
and single-stick; and it was here that he received Grisier, Cook,
and Charles Leboucher. The rest of the furniture of this privileged
apartment consisted of old cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and
Japanese vases, Lucca della Robbia faience, and Palissy platters; of old
arm-chairs, in which perhaps had sat Henry IV. or Sully, Louis XIII. or
Richelieu&#8212;for two of these arm-chairs, adorned with a carved shield,
on which were engraved the fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field
evidently came from the Louvre, or, at least, some royal residence. Over
these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed beneath
Persia's sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta or of
Chandernagor. What these stuffs did there, it was impossible to say;
they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to their
owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their golden
and silky reflections. In the centre of the room was a Roller and
Blanchet "baby grand" piano in rosewood, but holding the potentialities
of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath
the weight of the chefs-d'oeuvre of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn,
Gretry, and Porpora. On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were
swords, daggers, Malay creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked,
and inlaid suits of armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds,
their flame-colored wings outspread in motionless flight, and their
beaks forever open. This was Albert's favorite lounging place.</p>

<p id="id03783">However, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established
himself in the small salon down-stairs. There, on a table, surrounded at
some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco
known,&#8212;from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai,
and so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto-Rico, to Latakia,&#8212;was
exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond;
beside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their
size and quality, pueros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an
open cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their
amber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their
long tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the
smokers. Albert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the
symmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast
of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from
their mouths, and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling.
At a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom
named John, and who only spoke English, all Albert's establishment,
although the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great
occasions the count's chasseur also. This valet, whose name was Germain,
and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master, held in one
hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of letters, which
he gave to Albert. Albert glanced carelessly at the different missives,
selected two written in a small and delicate hand, and enclosed in
scented envelopes, opened them and perused their contents with some
attention. "How did these letters come?" said he.</p>

<p id="id03784">"One by the post, Madame Danglars' footman left the other."</p>

<p id="id03785">"Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her
box. Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera
I will sup with her as she wishes. Take her six bottles of different
wine&#8212;Cyprus, sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get
them at Borel's, and be sure you say they are for me."</p>

<p id="id03786">"At what o'clock, sir, do you breakfast?"</p>

<p id="id03787">"What time is it now?"</p>

<p id="id03788">"A quarter to ten."</p>

<p id="id03789">"Very well, at half past ten. Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go to
the minister&#8212;and besides" (Albert looked at his tablets), "it is the
hour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and though I do not
much rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual. Is the countess up
yet?"</p>

<p id="id03790">"If you wish, I will inquire."</p>

<p id="id03791">"Yes, ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets, mine is incomplete; and
tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three o'clock, and
that I request permission to introduce some one to her." The valet left
the room. Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off the cover of two
or three of the papers, looked at the theatre announcements, made a face
seeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet; hunted vainly amongst the
advertisements for a new tooth-powder of which he had heard, and threw
down, one after the other, the three leading papers of Paris, muttering,
"These papers become more and more stupid every day." A moment after,
a carriage stopped before the door, and the servant announced M. Lucien
Debray. A tall young man, with light hair, clear gray eyes, and thin
and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold
buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell eye-glass suspended by a
silken thread, and which, by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic
muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a half-official air, without
smiling or speaking. "Good-morning, Lucien, good-morning," said Albert;
"your punctuality really alarms me. What do I say? punctuality! You,
whom I expected last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time
fixed was half-past! Has the ministry resigned?"</p>

<p id="id03792">"No, my dear fellow," returned the young man, seating himself on the
divan; "reassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we never fall,
and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility,
and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us."</p>

<p id="id03793">"Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain."</p>

<p id="id03794">"No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans. We take him to
the other side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at
Bourges."</p>

<p id="id03795">"At Bourges?"</p>

<p id="id03796">"Yes, he has not much to complain of; Bourges is the capital of Charles
VII. Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday, and the day
before it had already transpired on the Bourse, and M. Danglars (I do
not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon
as we do) made a million!"</p>

<p id="id03797">"And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your
button-hole."</p>

<p id="id03798">"Yes; they sent me the order of Charles III.," returned Debray,
carelessly.</p>

<p id="id03799">"Come, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to have
it."</p>

<p id="id03800">"Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet. It looks very neat on a
black coat buttoned up."</p>

<p id="id03801">"And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt."</p>

<p id="id03802">"It is for that reason you see me so early."</p>

<p id="id03803">"Because you have the order of Charles III., and you wish to announce
the good news to me?"</p>

<p id="id03804">"No, because I passed the night writing letters,&#8212;five and twenty
despatches. I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but my
head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour. At the Bois de
Boulogne, ennui and hunger attacked me at once,&#8212;two enemies who rarely
accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a sort of
Carlo-republican alliance. I then recollected you gave a breakfast this
morning, and here I am. I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me."</p>

<p id="id03805">"It is my duty as your host," returned Albert, ringing the bell, while
Lucien turned over, with his gold-mounted cane, the papers that lay on
the table. "Germain, a glass of sherry and a biscuit. In the meantime,
my dear Lucien, here are cigars&#8212;contraband, of course&#8212;try them, and
persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with
cabbage leaves."</p>

<p id="id03806">"Peste, I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come from
government you would find them execrable. Besides, that does not concern
the home but the financial department. Address yourself to M. Humann,
section of the indirect contributions, corridor A., No. 26."</p>

<p id="id03807">"On my word," said Albert, "you astonish me by the extent of your
knowledge. Take a cigar."</p>

<p id="id03808">"Really, my dear Albert," replied Lucien, lighting a manilla at a
rose-colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand&#8212;"how
happy you are to have nothing to do. You do not know your own good
fortune!"</p>

<p id="id03809">"And what would you do, my dear diplomatist," replied Morcerf, with a
slight degree of irony in his voice, "if you did nothing? What? private
secretary to a minister, plunged at once into European cabals and
Parisian intrigues; having kings, and, better still, queens, to protect,
parties to unite, elections to direct; making more use of your cabinet
with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his battle-fields
with his sword and his victories; possessing five and twenty thousand
francs a year, besides your place; a horse, for which Chateau-Renaud
offered you four hundred louis, and which you would not part with; a
tailor who never disappoints you; with the opera, the jockey-club, and
other diversions, can you not amuse yourself? Well, I will amuse you."</p>

<p id="id03810">"How?"</p>

<p id="id03811">"By introducing to you a new acquaintance."</p>

<p id="id03812">"A man or a woman?"</p>

<p id="id03813">"A man."</p>

<p id="id03814">"I know so many men already."</p>

<p id="id03815">"But you do not know this man."</p>

<p id="id03816">"Where does he come from&#8212;the end of the world?"</p>

<p id="id03817">"Farther still, perhaps."</p>

<p id="id03818">"The deuce! I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him."</p>

<p id="id03819">"Oh, no; our breakfast comes from my father's kitchen. Are you hungry?"</p>

<p id="id03820">"Humiliating as such a confession is, I am. But I dined at M. de
Villefort's, and lawyers always give you very bad dinners. You would
think they felt some remorse; did you ever remark that?"</p>

<p id="id03821">"Ah, depreciate other persons' dinners; you ministers give such splendid
ones."</p>

<p id="id03822">"Yes; but we do not invite people of fashion. If we were not forced to
entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with
us, we should never dream of dining at home, I assure you."</p>

<p id="id03823">"Well, take another glass of sherry and another biscuit."</p>

<p id="id03824">"Willingly. Your Spanish wine is excellent. You see we were quite right
to pacify that country."</p>

<p id="id03825">"Yes; but Don Carlos?"</p>

<p id="id03826">"Well, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux, and in ten years we will marry
his son to the little queen."</p>

<p id="id03827">"You will then obtain the Golden Fleece, if you are still in the
ministry."</p>

<p id="id03828">"I think, Albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke
this morning."</p>

<p id="id03829">"Well, you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach; but I hear
Beauchamp in the next room; you can dispute together, and that will pass
away the time."</p>

<p id="id03830">"About what?"</p>

<p id="id03831">"About the papers."</p>

<p id="id03832">"My dear friend," said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt, "do I
ever read the papers?"</p>

<p id="id03833">"Then you will dispute the more."</p>

<p id="id03834">"M. Beauchamp," announced the servant. "Come in, come in," said Albert,
rising and advancing to meet the young man. "Here is Debray, who detests
you without reading you, so he says."</p>

<p id="id03835">"He is quite right," returned Beauchamp; "for I criticise him without
knowing what he does. Good-day, commander!"</p>

<p id="id03836">"Ah, you know that already," said the private secretary, smiling and
shaking hands with him.</p>

<p id="id03837">"Pardieu?"</p>

<p id="id03838">"And what do they say of it in the world?"</p>

<p id="id03839">"In which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838."</p>

<p id="id03840">"In the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders."</p>

<p id="id03841">"They say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you ought
to reap a little blue."</p>

<p id="id03842">"Come, come, that is not bad!" said Lucien. "Why do you not join our
party, my dear Beauchamp? With your talents you would make your fortune
in three or four years."</p>

<p id="id03843">"I only await one thing before following your advice; that is, a
minister who will hold office for six months. My dear Albert, one word,
for I must give poor Lucien a respite. Do we breakfast or dine? I must
go to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one."</p>

<p id="id03844">"You only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they arrive we
shall sit down to table."</p>

<h2 id="id03845" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 40. The Breakfast.</h2>

<p id="id03846">"And what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast?" said Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id03847">"A gentleman, and a diplomatist."</p>

<p id="id03848">"Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three
for the diplomatist. I shall come back to dessert; keep me some
strawberries, coffee, and cigars. I shall take a cutlet on my way to the
Chamber."</p>

<p id="id03849">"Do not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a Montmorency,
and the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at eleven; in the
meantime, follow Debray's example, and take a glass of sherry and a
biscuit."</p>

<p id="id03850">"Be it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts."</p>

<p id="id03851">"You are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister is
out of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous."</p>

<p id="id03852">"Ah, you do not know with what I am threatened. I shall hear this
morning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and
at his wife's this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of France.
The devil take the constitutional government, and since we had our
choice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?"</p>

<p id="id03853">"I understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity."</p>

<p id="id03854">"Do not run down M. Danglars' speeches," said Debray; "he votes for you,
for he belongs to the opposition."</p>

<p id="id03855">"Pardieu, that is exactly the worst of all. I am waiting until you send
him to speak at the Luxembourg, to laugh at my ease."</p>

<p id="id03856">"My dear friend," said Albert to Beauchamp, "it is plain that the
affairs of Spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of humor
this morning. Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage
between myself and Mlle. Eugenie Danglars; I cannot in conscience,
therefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say
to me, 'Vicomte, you know I give my daughter two millions.'"</p>

<p id="id03857">"Ah, this marriage will never take place," said Beauchamp. "The king
has made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he cannot make him a
gentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent, for
the paltry sum of two million francs, to a mesalliance. The Viscount of
Morcerf can only wed a marchioness."</p>

<p id="id03858">"But two million francs make a nice little sum," replied Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id03859">"It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a railroad
from the Jardin des Plantes to La Rapee."</p>

<p id="id03860">"Never mind what he says, Morcerf," said Debray, "do you marry her. You
marry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does that matter? It
is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it. You have seven
martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will still have
four; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly became King
of France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany."</p>

<p id="id03861">"On my word, I think you are right, Lucien," said Albert absently.</p>

<p id="id03862">"To be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard&#8212;that
is, he can be."</p>

<p id="id03863">"Do not say that, Debray," returned Beauchamp, laughing, "for here is
Chateau-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass
the sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor, through your body."</p>

<p id="id03864">"He will sully it then," returned Lucien; "for I am low&#8212;very low."</p>

<p id="id03865">"Oh, heavens," cried Beauchamp, "the minister quotes Beranger, what
shall we come to next?"</p>

<p id="id03866">"M. de Chateau-Renaud&#8212;M. Maximilian Morrel," said the servant,
announcing two fresh guests.</p>

<p id="id03867">"Now, then, to breakfast," said Beauchamp; "for, if I remember, you told
me you only expected two persons, Albert."</p>

<p id="id03868">"Morrel," muttered Albert&#8212;"Morrel&#8212;who is he?" But before he had
finished, M. de Chateau-Renaud, a handsome young man of thirty,
gentleman all over,&#8212;that is, with the figure of a Guiche and the wit
of a Mortemart,&#8212;took Albert's hand. "My dear Albert," said he, "let me
introduce to you M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis, my friend; and
what is more&#8212;however the man speaks for himself&#8212;my preserver. Salute
my hero, viscount." And he stepped on one side to give place to a young
man of refined and dignified bearing, with large and open brow,
piercing eyes, and black mustache, whom our readers have already seen
at Marseilles, under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be
forgotten. A rich uniform, half French, half Oriental, set off his
graceful and stalwart figure, and his broad chest was decorated with
the order of the Legion of Honor. The young officer bowed with easy and
elegant politeness. "Monsieur," said Albert with affectionate courtesy,
"the count of Chateau-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction
would give me; you are his friend, be ours also."</p>

<p id="id03869">"Well said," interrupted Chateau-Renaud; "and pray that, if you should
ever be in a similar predicament, he may do as much for you as he did
for me."</p>

<p id="id03870">"What has he done?" asked Albert.</p>

<p id="id03871">"Oh, nothing worth speaking of," said Morrel; "M. de Chateau-Renaud
exaggerates."</p>

<p id="id03872">"Not worth speaking of?" cried Chateau-Renaud; "life is not worth
speaking of!&#8212;that is rather too philosophical, on my word, Morrel. It
is very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me, who only
did so once"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id03873">"We gather from all this, baron, that Captain Morrel saved your life."</p>

<p id="id03874">"Exactly so."</p>

<p id="id03875">"On what occasion?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id03876">"Beauchamp, my good fellow, you know I am starving," said Debray: "do
not set him off on some long story."</p>

<p id="id03877">"Well, I do not prevent your sitting down to table," replied Beauchamp,<br/>

"Chateau-Renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast."<br/></p>

<p id="id03878">"Gentlemen," said Morcerf, "it is only a quarter past ten, and I expect
some one else."</p>

<p id="id03879">"Ah, true, a diplomatist!" observed Debray.</p>

<p id="id03880">"Diplomat or not, I don't know; I only know that he charged himself
on my account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to my
satisfaction, that had I been king, I should have instantly created him
knight of all my orders, even had I been able to offer him the Golden
Fleece and the Garter."</p>

<p id="id03881">"Well, since we are not to sit down to table," said Debray, "take a
glass of sherry, and tell us all about it."</p>

<p id="id03882">"You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa."</p>

<p id="id03883">"It is a road your ancestors have traced for you," said Albert
gallantly.</p>

<p id="id03884">"Yes? but I doubt that your object was like theirs&#8212;to rescue the Holy<br/>

Sepulchre."<br/></p>

<p id="id03885">"You are quite right, Beauchamp," observed the young aristocrat. "It was
only to fight as an amateur. I cannot bear duelling since two seconds,
whom I had chosen to arrange an affair, forced me to break the arm of
one of my best friends, one whom you all know&#8212;poor Franz d'Epinay."</p>

<p id="id03886">"Ah, true," said Debray, "you did fight some time ago; about what?"</p>

<p id="id03887">"The devil take me, if I remember," returned Chateau-Renaud. "But I
recollect perfectly one thing, that, being unwilling to let such talents
as mine sleep, I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols that had
been given to me. In consequence I embarked for Oran, and went from
thence to Constantine, where I arrived just in time to witness the
raising of the siege. I retreated with the rest, for eight and forty
hours. I endured the rain during the day, and the cold during the
night tolerably well, but the third morning my horse died of cold. Poor
brute&#8212;accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable,
the Arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in Arabia."</p>

<p id="id03888">"That's why you want to purchase my English horse," said Debray, "you
think he will bear the cold better."</p>

<p id="id03889">"You are mistaken, for I have made a vow never to return to Africa."</p>

<p id="id03890">"You were very much frightened, then?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id03891">"Well, yes, and I had good reason to be so," replied Chateau-Renaud. "I
was retreating on foot, for my horse was dead. Six Arabs came up, full
gallop, to cut off my head. I shot two with my double-barrelled gun, and
two more with my pistols, but I was then disarmed, and two were still
left; one seized me by the hair (that is why I now wear it so short, for
no one knows what may happen), the other swung a yataghan, and I already
felt the cold steel on my neck, when this gentleman whom you see here
charged them, shot the one who held me by the hair, and cleft the skull
of the other with his sabre. He had assigned himself the task of saving
a man's life that day; chance caused that man to be myself. When I am
rich I will order a statue of Chance from Klagmann or Marochetti."</p>

<p id="id03892">"Yes," said Morrel, smiling, "it was the 5th of September, the
anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved;
therefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to celebrate it by
some"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id03893">"Heroic action," interrupted Chateau-Renaud. "I was chosen. But that is
not all&#8212;after rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold,
not by sharing his cloak with me, like St. Martin, but by giving me the
whole; then from hunger by sharing with me&#8212;guess what?"</p>

<p id="id03894">"A Strasbourg pie?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id03895">"No, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty
appetite. It was very hard."</p>

<p id="id03896">"The horse?" said Morcerf, laughing.</p>

<p id="id03897">"No, the sacrifice," returned Chateau-Renaud; "ask Debray if he would
sacrifice his English steed for a stranger?"</p>

<p id="id03898">"Not for a stranger," said Debray, "but for a friend I might, perhaps."</p>

<p id="id03899">"I divined that you would become mine, count," replied Morrel; "besides,
as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or not, that
day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good
fortune had on other days granted to us."</p>

<p id="id03900">"The history to which M. Morrel alludes," continued Chateau-Renaud, "is
an admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better
acquainted with him; to-day let us fill our stomachs, and not our
memories. What time do you breakfast, Albert?"</p>

<p id="id03901">"At half-past ten."</p>

<p id="id03902">"Precisely?" asked Debray, taking out his watch.</p>

<p id="id03903">"Oh, you will give me five minutes' grace," replied Morcerf, "for I also
expect a preserver."</p>

<p id="id03904">"Of whom?"</p>

<p id="id03905">"Of myself," cried Morcerf; "parbleu, do you think I cannot be saved as
well as any one else, and that there are only Arabs who cut off heads?
Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at table&#8212;at
least, I hope so&#8212;two benefactors of humanity."</p>

<p id="id03906">"What shall we do?" said Debray; "we have only one Monthyon prize."</p>

<p id="id03907">"Well, it will be given to some one who has done nothing to deserve it,"
said Beauchamp; "that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the
dilemma."</p>

<p id="id03908">"And where does he come from?" asked Debray. "You have already answered
the question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second
time."</p>

<p id="id03909">"Really," said Albert, "I do not know; when I invited him three months
ago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows where he may
have gone?"</p>

<p id="id03910">"And you think him capable of being exact?" demanded Debray.</p>

<p id="id03911">"I think him capable of everything."</p>

<p id="id03912">"Well, with the five minutes' grace, we have only ten left."</p>

<p id="id03913">"I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest."</p>

<p id="id03914">"I beg pardon," interrupted Beauchamp; "are there any materials for an
article in what you are going to tell us?"</p>

<p id="id03915">"Yes, and for a most curious one."</p>

<p id="id03916">"Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning, and<br/>

I must make up for it."<br/></p>

<p id="id03917">"I was at Rome during the last Carnival."</p>

<p id="id03918">"We know that," said Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id03919">"Yes, but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits."</p>

<p id="id03920">"There are no bandits," cried Debray.</p>

<p id="id03921">"Yes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for I
found them ugly enough to frighten me."</p>

<p id="id03922">"Come, my dear Albert," said Debray, "confess that your cook is
behindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes,
and that, like Madame de Maintenon, you are going to replace the dish
by a story. Say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse you,
and to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be."</p>

<p id="id03923">"And I say to you, fabulous as it may seem, I tell it as a true one from
beginning to end. The brigands had carried me off, and conducted me to a
gloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian."</p>

<p id="id03924">"I know it," said Chateau-Renaud; "I narrowly escaped catching a fever
there."</p>

<p id="id03925">"And I did more than that," replied Morcerf, "for I caught one. I
was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4,000 Roman
crowns&#8212;about 24,000 francs. Unfortunately, I had not above 1,500. I was
at the end of my journey and of my credit. I wrote to Franz&#8212;and were he
here he would confirm every word&#8212;I wrote then to Franz that if he did
not come with the four thousand crowns before six, at ten minutes past
I should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in
whose company I had the honor of being; and Signor Luigi Vampa, such was
the name of the chief of these bandits, would have scrupulously kept his
word."</p>

<p id="id03926">"But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns," said Chateau-Renaud.
"A man whose name is Franz d'Epinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much
difficulty in procuring them."</p>

<p id="id03927">"No, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to
you."</p>

<p id="id03928">"Ah, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing<br/>

Andromeda."<br/></p>

<p id="id03929">"No, he is a man about my own size."</p>

<p id="id03930">"Armed to the teeth?"</p>

<p id="id03931">"He had not even a knitting-needle."</p>

<p id="id03932">"But he paid your ransom?"</p>

<p id="id03933">"He said two words to the chief and I was free."</p>

<p id="id03934">"And they apologized to him for having carried you off?" said Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id03935">"Just so."</p>

<p id="id03936">"Why, he is a second Ariosto."</p>

<p id="id03937">"No, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id03938">"There is no Count of Monte Cristo" said Debray.</p>

<p id="id03939">"I do not think so," added Chateau-Renaud, with the air of a man who
knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly.</p>

<p id="id03940">"Does any one know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo?"</p>

<p id="id03941">"He comes possibly from the Holy Land, and one of his ancestors
possessed Calvary, as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea."</p>

<p id="id03942">"I think I can assist your researches," said Maximilian. "Monte Cristo
is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my
father employed&#8212;a grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean, an
atom in the infinite."</p>

<p id="id03943">"Precisely!" cried Albert. "Well, he of whom I speak is the lord and
master of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased the title
of count somewhere in Tuscany."</p>

<p id="id03944">"He is rich, then?"</p>

<p id="id03945">"I believe so."</p>

<p id="id03946">"But that ought to be visible."</p>

<p id="id03947">"That is what deceives you, Debray."</p>

<p id="id03948">"I do not understand you."</p>

<p id="id03949">"Have you read the 'Arabian Nights'?"</p>

<p id="id03950">"What a question!"</p>

<p id="id03951">"Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if
their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? They seem like poor
fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the
wealth of the Indies."</p>

<p id="id03952">"Which means?"</p>

<p id="id03953">"Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen. He
has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself Sinbad the
Sailor, and has a cave filled with gold."</p>

<p id="id03954">"And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id03955">"No, but Franz has; for heaven's sake, not a word of this before him.
Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by mutes and
by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet. Only he is not quite
sure about the women, for they did not come in until after he had taken
hashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of
statues."</p>

<p id="id03956">The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to say,&#8212;"Are you mad, or are
you laughing at us?"</p>

<p id="id03957">"And I also," said Morrel thoughtfully, "have heard something like this
from an old sailor named Penelon."</p>

<p id="id03958">"Ah," cried Albert, "it is very lucky that M. Morrel comes to aid me;
you are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth?"</p>

<p id="id03959">"My dear Albert," said Debray, "what you tell us is so extraordinary."</p>

<p id="id03960">"Ah, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of
them&#8212;they have no time. They are too much taken up with interfering in
the affairs of their countrymen who travel."</p>

<p id="id03961">"Now you get angry, and attack our poor agents. How will you have them
protect you? The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day, so that now
they have scarcely any. Will you be ambassador, Albert? I will send you
to Constantinople."</p>

<p id="id03962">"No, lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali, the<br/>

Sultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me."<br/></p>

<p id="id03963">"You say very true," responded Debray.</p>

<p id="id03964">"Yes," said Albert, "but this has nothing to do with the existence of
the Count of Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id03965">"Pardieu, every one exists."</p>

<p id="id03966">"Doubtless, but not in the same way; every one has not black slaves,
a princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an
Arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and Greek
mistresses."</p>

<p id="id03967">"Have you seen the Greek mistress?"</p>

<p id="id03968">"I have both seen and heard her. I saw her at the theatre, and heard her
one morning when I breakfasted with the count."</p>

<p id="id03969">"He eats, then?"</p>

<p id="id03970">"Yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating."</p>

<p id="id03971">"He must be a vampire."</p>

<p id="id03972">"Laugh, if you will; the Countess G&#8212;&#8212;, who knew Lord Ruthven, declared
that the count was a vampire."</p>

<p id="id03973">"Ah, capital," said Beauchamp. "For a man not connected with newspapers,
here is the pendant to the famous sea-serpent of the Constitutionnel."</p>

<p id="id03974">"Wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure," said
Debray; "facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead,
livid complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness
unexceptionable."</p>

<p id="id03975">"Just so, Lucien," returned Morcerf; "you have described him feature for
feature. Yes, keen and cutting politeness. This man has often made me
shudder; and one day that we were viewing an execution, I thought I
should faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which
he spoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the
executioner and the culprit."</p>

<p id="id03976">"Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your
blood?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id03977">"Or, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment,
surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birth-right?"</p>

<p id="id03978">"Rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen," said Morcerf, somewhat
piqued. "When I look at you Parisians, idlers on the Boulevard de Gand
or the Bois de Boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are
not of the same race."</p>

<p id="id03979">"I am highly flattered," returned Beauchamp. "At the same time," added
Chateau-Renaud, "your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow,
always excepting his little arrangements with the Italian banditti."</p>

<p id="id03980">"There are no Italian banditti," said Debray.</p>

<p id="id03981">"No vampire," cried Beauchamp. "No Count of Monte Cristo" added Debray.<br/>

"There is half-past ten striking, Albert."<br/></p>

<p id="id03982">"Confess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,"
continued Beauchamp. But the sound of the clock had not died away when
Germain announced, "His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo." The
involuntary start every one gave proved how much Morcerf's narrative
had impressed them, and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from
manifesting sudden emotion. He had not heard a carriage stop in the
street, or steps in the ante-chamber; the door had itself opened
noiselessly. The count appeared, dressed with the greatest simplicity,
but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in
his toilet. Every article of dress&#8212;hat, coat, gloves, and boots&#8212;was
from the first makers. He seemed scarcely five and thirty. But what
struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had
drawn. The count advanced, smiling, into the centre of the room, and
approached Albert, who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a
ceremonial manner. "Punctuality," said Monte Cristo, "is the politeness
of kings, according to one of your sovereigns, I think; but it is not
the same with travellers. However, I hope you will excuse the two
or three seconds I am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be
accomplished without some trouble, and especially in France, where, it
seems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions."</p>

<p id="id03983">"My dear count," replied Albert, "I was announcing your visit to some of
my friends, whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me
the honor to make, and whom I now present to you. They are the Count of
Chateau-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers, and whose
ancestors had a place at the Round Table; M. Lucien Debray, private
secretary to the minister of the interior; M. Beauchamp, an editor of a
paper, and the terror of the French government, but of whom, in spite of
his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in Italy, since his
paper is prohibited there; and M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis."</p>

<p id="id03984">At this name the count, who had hitherto saluted every one with
courtesy, but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a
pace forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks. "You
wear the uniform of the new French conquerors, monsieur," said he; "it
is a handsome uniform." No one could have said what caused the count's
voice to vibrate so deeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in
general so clear, lustrous, and limpid when he pleased. "You have never
seen our Africans, count?" said Albert. "Never," replied the count, who
was by this time perfectly master of himself again.</p>

<p id="id03985">"Well, beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts
in the whole army."</p>

<p id="id03986">"Oh, M. de Morcerf," interrupted Morrel.</p>

<p id="id03987">"Let me go on, captain. And we have just heard," continued Albert, "of
a new deed of his, and so heroic a one, that, although I have seen him
to-day for the first time, I request you to allow me to introduce him
as my friend." At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte
Cristo the concentrated look, changing color, and slight trembling of
the eyelid that show emotion. "Ah, you have a noble heart," said the
count; "so much the better." This exclamation, which corresponded to
the count's own thought rather than to what Albert was saying, surprised
everybody, and especially Morrel, who looked at Monte Cristo with
wonder. But, at the same time, the intonation was so soft that, however
strange the speech might seem, it was impossible to be offended at it.
"Why should he doubt it?" said Beauchamp to Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id03988">"In reality," replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic glance
and his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was
penetrable in Monte Cristo, "Albert has not deceived us, for the count
is a most singular being. What say you, Morrel!"</p>

<p id="id03989">"Ma foi, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of the
singular remark he has made about me."</p>

<p id="id03990">"Gentlemen," said Albert, "Germain informs me that breakfast is ready.
My dear count, allow me to show you the way." They passed silently into
the breakfast-room, and every one took his place. "Gentlemen," said the
count, seating himself, "permit me to make a confession which must form
my excuse for any improprieties I may commit. I am a stranger, and a
stranger to such a degree, that this is the first time I have ever been
at Paris. The French way of living is utterly unknown to me, and up to
the present time I have followed the Eastern customs, which are entirely
in contrast to the Parisian. I beg you, therefore, to excuse if you find
anything in me too Turkish, too Italian, or too Arabian. Now, then, let
us breakfast."</p>

<p id="id03991">"With what an air he says all this," muttered Beauchamp; "decidedly he
is a great man."</p>

<p id="id03992">"A great man in his own country," added Debray.</p>

<p id="id03993">"A great man in every country, M. Debray," said Chateau-Renaud. The
count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest. Albert remarked
this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the Parisian mode of
life should displease the traveller in the most essential point. "My
dear count," said he, "I fear one thing, and that is, that the fare of
the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza di
Spagni. I ought to have consulted you on the point, and have had some
dishes prepared expressly."</p>

<p id="id03994">"Did you know me better," returned the count, smiling, "you would not
give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself, who
has successively lived on maccaroni at Naples, polenta at Milan, olla
podrida at Valencia, pilau at Constantinople, karrick in India, and
swallows' nests in China. I eat everywhere, and of everything, only
I eat but little; and to-day, that you reproach me with my want of
appetite, is my day of appetite, for I have not eaten since yesterday
morning."</p>

<p id="id03995">"What," cried all the guests, "you have not eaten for four and twenty
hours?"</p>

<p id="id03996">"No," replied the count; "I was forced to go out of my road to obtain
some information near Nimes, so that I was somewhat late, and therefore
I did not choose to stop."</p>

<p id="id03997">"And you ate in your carriage?" asked Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id03998">"No, I slept, as I generally do when I am weary without having the
courage to amuse myself, or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to
eat."</p>

<p id="id03999">"But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?" said Morrel.</p>

<p id="id04000">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id04001">"You have a recipe for it?"</p>

<p id="id04002">"An infallible one."</p>

<p id="id04003">"That would be invaluable to us in Africa, who have not always any food
to eat, and rarely anything to drink."</p>

<p id="id04004">"Yes," said Monte Cristo; "but, unfortunately, a recipe excellent for a
man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army, which might
not awake when it was needed."</p>

<p id="id04005">"May we inquire what is this recipe?" asked Debray.</p>

<p id="id04006">"Oh, yes," returned Monte Cristo; "I make no secret of it. It is a
mixture of excellent opium, which I fetched myself from Canton in order
to have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the East&#8212;that is,
between the Tigris and the Euphrates. These two ingredients are mixed
in equal proportions, and formed into pills. Ten minutes after one is
taken, the effect is produced. Ask Baron Franz d'Epinay; I think he
tasted them one day."</p>

<p id="id04007">"Yes," replied Morcerf, "he said something about it to me."</p>

<p id="id04008">"But," said Beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very
incredulous, "you always carry this drug about you?"</p>

<p id="id04009">"Always."</p>

<p id="id04010">"Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?"
continued Beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.</p>

<p id="id04011">"No, monsieur," returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a
marvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden
lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet
about the size of a pea. This ball had an acrid and penetrating odor.
There were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain about
a dozen. The casket passed around the table, but it was more to examine
the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to
hand. "And is it your cook who prepares these pills?" asked Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id04012">"Oh, no, monsieur," replied Monte Cristo; "I do not thus betray my
enjoyments to the vulgar. I am a tolerable chemist, and prepare my pills
myself."</p>

<p id="id04013">"This is a magnificent emerald, and the largest I have ever seen," said<br/>

Chateau-Renaud, "although my mother has some remarkable family jewels."<br/></p>

<p id="id04014">"I had three similar ones," returned Monte Cristo. "I gave one to the
Sultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy father the
Pope, who had it set in his tiara, opposite to one nearly as large,
though not so fine, given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor,
Pius VII. I kept the third for myself, and I had it hollowed out, which
reduced its value, but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I
intended." Every one looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment; he spoke
with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth, or
that he was mad. However, the sight of the emerald made them naturally
incline to the former belief. "And what did these two sovereigns give
you in exchange for these magnificent presents?" asked Debray.</p>

<p id="id04015">"The Sultan, the liberty of a woman," replied the Count; "the Pope, the
life of a man; so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if
heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne."</p>

<p id="id04016">"And it was Peppino you saved, was it not?" cried Morcerf; "it was for
him that you obtained pardon?"</p>

<p id="id04017">"Perhaps," returned the count, smiling.</p>

<p id="id04018">"My dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you
speak thus," said Morcerf. "I had announced you beforehand to my friends
as an enchanter of the 'Arabian Nights,' a wizard of the Middle Ages;
but the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for
caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths, when these
truths do not form a part of their daily existence. For example, here is
Debray who reads, and Beauchamp who prints, every day, 'A member of the
Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard;' 'four persons
have been assassinated in the Rue St. Denis' or 'the Faubourg St.
Germain;' 'ten, fifteen, or twenty thieves, have been arrested in a cafe
on the Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes de Julien,'&#8212;and yet these
same men deny the existence of the bandits in the Maremma, the Campagna
di Romana, or the Pontine Marshes. Tell them yourself that I was taken
by bandits, and that without your generous intercession I should
now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, instead of
receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du Helder."</p>

<p id="id04019">"Ah," said Monte Cristo "you promised me never to mention that
circumstance."</p>

<p id="id04020">"It was not I who made that promise," cried Morcerf; "it must have been
some one else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and whom you
have forgotten. Pray speak of it, for I shall not only, I trust, relate
the little I do know, but also a great deal I do not know."</p>

<p id="id04021">"It seems to me," returned the count, smiling, "that you played a
sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened."</p>

<p id="id04022">"Well, you promise me, if I tell all I know, to relate, in your turn,
all that I do not know?"</p>

<p id="id04023">"That is but fair," replied Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04024">"Well," said Morcerf, "for three days I believed myself the object of
the attentions of a masque, whom I took for a descendant of Tullia or
Poppoea, while I was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina,
and I say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl. What I know is, that,
like a fool, a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now, I mistook
for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, with a
beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was about to imprint
a chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my head, and, aided by
seven or eight others, led, or rather dragged me, to the Catacombs of
St. Sebastian, where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing
Caesar's 'Commentaries,' and who deigned to leave off reading to inform
me, that unless the next morning, before six o'clock, four thousand
piastres were paid into his account at his banker's, at a quarter past
six I should have ceased to exist. The letter is still to be seen,
for it is in Franz d'Epinay's possession, signed by me, and with a
postscript of M. Luigi Vampa. This is all I know, but I know not, count,
how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who
ordinarily have so little respect for anything. I assure you, Franz and
I were lost in admiration."</p>

<p id="id04025">"Nothing more simple," returned the count. "I had known the famous Vampa
for more than ten years. When he was quite a child, and only a shepherd,
I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way, and he, in order to
repay me, gave me a poniard, the hilt of which he had carved with his
own hand, and which you may have seen in my collection of arms. In after
years, whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents, which
ought to have cemented our friendship, or whether he did not recollect
me, he sought to take me, but, on the contrary, it was I who captured
him and a dozen of his band. I might have handed him over to Roman
justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would have been
particularly so with him; but I did nothing of the sort&#8212;I suffered him
and his band to depart."</p>

<p id="id04026">"With the condition that they should sin no more," said Beauchamp,
laughing. "I see they kept their promise."</p>

<p id="id04027">"No, monsieur," returned Monte Cristo "upon the simple condition that
they should respect myself and my friends. Perhaps what I am about to
say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and
your duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a society which
does not protect me, and which I will even say, generally occupies
itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place
in my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society
and my neighbor who are indebted to me."</p>

<p id="id04028">"Bravo," cried Chateau-Renaud; "you are the first man I ever met
sufficiently courageous to preach egotism. Bravo, count, bravo!"</p>

<p id="id04029">"It is frank, at least," said Morrel. "But I am sure that the count does
not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly
avowed."</p>

<p id="id04030">"How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?" asked Monte
Cristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity,
that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that
clear and piercing glance.</p>

<p id="id04031">"Why, it seems to me," replied Morrel, "that in delivering M. de
Morcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your neighbor and to
society."</p>

<p id="id04032">"Of which he is the brightest ornament," said Beauchamp, drinking off a
glass of champagne.</p>

<p id="id04033">"My dear count," cried Morcerf, "you are at fault&#8212;you, one of the most
formidable logicians I know&#8212;and you must see it clearly proved that
instead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist. Ah, you call
yourself Oriental, a Levantine, Maltese, Indian, Chinese; your family
name is Monte Cristo; Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal appellation,
and yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display
the greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric
Parisians,&#8212;that is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal the
virtues you possess."</p>

<p id="id04034">"My dear vicomte," returned Monte Cristo, "I do not see, in all I have
done, anything that merits, either from you or these gentlemen, the
pretended eulogies I have received. You were no stranger to me, for
I knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you to
breakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival
in your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo
the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted. I will
appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands
of a hideous bandit, as you term him? Besides, you know, I had the idea
that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came
to France. You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a
vague project, but to-day you see it was a reality, and you must submit
to it under penalty of breaking your word."</p>

<p id="id04035">"I will keep it," returned Morcerf; "but I fear that you will be much
disappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic
horizons. Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with
which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our Chimborazo
is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Valerien, our Great Desert is the
plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian well to water
the caravans. We have plenty of thieves, though not so many as is said;
but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord.
France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a city, that you will not
find in its eighty-five departments&#8212;I say eighty-five, because I do
not include Corsica&#8212;you will not find, then, in these eighty-five
departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto
in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp. There is but
one service I can render you, and for that I place myself entirely
at your orders, that is, to present, or make my friends present, you
everywhere; besides, you have no need of any one to introduce you&#8212;with
your name, and your fortune, and your talent" (Monte Cristo bowed with
a somewhat ironical smile) "you can present yourself everywhere, and be
well received. I can be useful in one way only&#8212;if knowledge of Parisian
habits, of the means of rendering yourself comfortable, or of the
bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to find you a fitting
dwelling here. I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you, as I
shared yours at Rome&#8212;I, who do not profess egotism, but am yet egotist
par excellence; for, except myself, these rooms would not hold a shadow
more, unless that shadow were feminine."</p>

<p id="id04036">"Ah," said the count, "that is a most conjugal reservation; I recollect
that at Rome you said something of a projected marriage. May I
congratulate you?"</p>

<p id="id04037">"The affair is still in projection."</p>

<p id="id04038">"And he who says in 'projection,' means already decided," said Debray.</p>

<p id="id04039">"No," replied Morcerf, "my father is most anxious about it; and I
hope, ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my
betrothed&#8212;Mademoiselle Eugenie Danglars."</p>

<p id="id04040">"Eugenie Danglars," said Monte Cristo; "tell me, is not her father Baron<br/>

Danglars?"<br/></p>

<p id="id04041">"Yes," returned Morcerf, "a baron of a new creation."</p>

<p id="id04042">"What matter," said Monte Cristo "if he has rendered the State services
which merit this distinction?"</p>

<p id="id04043">"Enormous ones," answered Beauchamp. "Although in reality a Liberal, he
negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in 1829, who made
him a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that he wears the
ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his
button-hole."</p>

<p id="id04044">"Ah," interrupted Morcerf, laughing, "Beauchamp, Beauchamp, keep that
for the Corsaire or the Charivari, but spare my future father-in-law
before me." Then, turning to Monte Cristo, "You just now spoke his name
as if you knew the baron?"</p>

<p id="id04045">"I do not know him," returned Monte Cristo; "but I shall probably soon
make his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him by the house
of Richard &amp; Blount, of London, Arstein &amp; Eskeles of Vienna, and Thomson
&amp; French at Rome." As he pronounced the two last names, the count
glanced at Maximilian Morrel. If the stranger expected to produce an
effect on Morrel, he was not mistaken&#8212;Maximilian started as if he had
been electrified. "Thomson &amp; French," said he; "do you know this house,
monsieur?"</p>

<p id="id04046">"They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world," returned
the count quietly. "Can my influence with them be of any service to
you?"</p>

<p id="id04047">"Oh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been,
up to the present, fruitless. This house, in past years, did ours a
great service, and has, I know not for what reason, always denied having
rendered us this service."</p>

<p id="id04048">"I shall be at your orders," said Monte Cristo bowing.</p>

<p id="id04049">"But," continued Morcerf, "a propos of Danglars,&#8212;we have strangely
wandered from the subject. We were speaking of a suitable habitation
for the Count of Monte Cristo. Come, gentlemen, let us all propose some
place. Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital?"</p>

<p id="id04050">"Faubourg Saint-Germain," said Chateau-Renaud. "The count will find
there a charming hotel, with a court and garden."</p>

<p id="id04051">"Bah, Chateau-Renaud," returned Debray, "you only know your dull
and gloomy Faubourg Saint-Germain; do not pay any attention to him,
count&#8212;live in the Chaussee d'Antin, that's the real centre of Paris."</p>

<p id="id04052">"Boulevard de l'Opera," said Beauchamp; "the second floor&#8212;a house with
a balcony. The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought
there, and as he smokes his chibouque, see all Paris pass before him."</p>

<p id="id04053">"You have no idea, then, Morrel?" asked Chateau-Renaud; "you do not
propose anything."</p>

<p id="id04054">"Oh, yes," returned the young man, smiling; "on the contrary, I have
one, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant
proposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of them, I will
venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel, in the
Pompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in the Rue
Meslay."</p>

<p id="id04055">"You have a sister?" asked the count.</p>

<p id="id04056">"Yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister."</p>

<p id="id04057">"Married?"</p>

<p id="id04058">"Nearly nine years."</p>

<p id="id04059">"Happy?" asked the count again.</p>

<p id="id04060">"As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be," replied
Maximilian. "She married the man she loved, who remained faithful to
us in our fallen fortunes&#8212;Emmanuel Herbaut." Monte Cristo smiled
imperceptibly. "I live there during my leave of absence," continued
Maximilian; "and I shall be, together with my brother-in-law Emmanuel,
at the disposition of the Count, whenever he thinks fit to honor us."</p>

<p id="id04061">"One minute," cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the time to
reply. "Take care, you are going to immure a traveller, Sinbad the
Sailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a patriarch
of him."</p>

<p id="id04062">"Oh, no," said Morrel; "my sister is five and twenty, my brother-in-law
is thirty, they are gay, young, and happy. Besides, the count will be in
his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do so."</p>

<p id="id04063">"Thanks, monsieur," said Monte Cristo; "I shall content myself with
being presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do me the
honor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of any one of these
gentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared."</p>

<p id="id04064">"What," cried Morcerf; "you are, then, going to an hotel&#8212;that will be
very dull for you."</p>

<p id="id04065">"Was I so badly lodged at Rome?" said Monte Cristo smiling.</p>

<p id="id04066">"Parbleu, at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your
apartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar
sum every day."</p>

<p id="id04067">"It is not that which deterred me," replied Monte Cristo; "but as I
determined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet de chambre, and
he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it."</p>

<p id="id04068">"But you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?" said<br/>

Beauchamp.<br/></p>

<p id="id04069">"It is the first time he has ever been in Paris. He is black, and cannot
speak," returned Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id04070">"It is Ali!" cried Albert, in the midst of the general surprise.</p>

<p id="id04071">"Yes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome."</p>

<p id="id04072">"Certainly," said Morcerf; "I recollect him perfectly. But how could you
charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?&#8212;he will
do everything wrong."</p>

<p id="id04073">"Undeceive yourself, monsieur," replied Monte Cristo; "I am quite sure,
that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish. He knows
my tastes, my caprices, my wants. He has been here a week, with the
instinct of a hound, hunting by himself. He will arrange everything for
me. He knew, that I should arrive to-day at ten o'clock; he was waiting
for me at nine at the Barriere de Fontainebleau. He gave me this paper;
it contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself," and Monte
Cristo passed a paper to Albert. "Ah, that is really original," said
Beauchamp.</p>

<p id="id04074">"And very princely," added Chateau-Renaud.</p>

<p id="id04075">"What, do you not know your house?" asked Debray.</p>

<p id="id04076">"No," said Monte Cristo; "I told you I did not wish to be behind my
time; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscount's
door." The young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was
a comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such
an air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said
was false&#8212;besides, why should he tell a falsehood? "We must content
ourselves, then," said Beauchamp, "with rendering the count all the
little services in our power. I, in my quality of journalist, open all
the theatres to him."</p>

<p id="id04077">"Thanks, monsieur," returned Monte Cristo, "my steward has orders to
take a box at each theatre."</p>

<p id="id04078">"Is your steward also a Nubian?" asked Debray.</p>

<p id="id04079">"No, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of any
one's. But you know him, M. de Morcerf."</p>

<p id="id04080">"Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows so
well?"</p>

<p id="id04081">"Yes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has been
a soldier, a smuggler&#8212;in fact, everything. I would not be quite sure
that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle&#8212;a stab
with a knife, for instance."</p>

<p id="id04082">"And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward," said Debray.<br/>

"Of how much does he rob you every year?"<br/></p>

<p id="id04083">"On my word," replied the count, "not more than another. I am sure he
answers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep him."</p>

<p id="id04084">"Then," continued Chateau-Renaud, "since you have an establishment, a
steward, and a hotel in the Champs Elysees, you only want a mistress."
Albert smiled. He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the count's
box at the Argentina and Valle theatres. "I have something better than
that," said Monte Cristo; "I have a slave. You procure your mistresses
from the opera, the Vaudeville, or the Varietes; I purchased mine at
Constantinople; it cost me more, but I have nothing to fear."</p>

<p id="id04085">"But you forget," replied Debray, laughing, "that we are Franks by name
and franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the moment she puts
her foot in France your slave becomes free."</p>

<p id="id04086">"Who will tell her?"</p>

<p id="id04087">"The first person who sees her."</p>
