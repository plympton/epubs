<h2 id="id05121" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 54. A Flurry in Stocks.</h2>

<p id="id05122">Some days after this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of
Monte Cristo at his house in the Champs Elysees, which had already
assumed that palace-like appearance which the count's princely fortune
enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences. He came to
renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to
the count through the medium of a letter, signed "Baronne Danglars,
nee Hermine de Servieux." Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who,
joining in his friend's conversation, added some passing compliments,
the source of which the count's talent for finesse easily enabled him to
guess. He was convinced that Lucien's visit was due to a double feeling
of curiosity, the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the
Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin. In short, Madame Danglars, not being able
personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household
arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who
went to the opera with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a
million of money, had deputed those eyes, by which she was accustomed
to see, to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this
incomprehensible person. But the count did not appear to suspect that
there could be the slightest connection between Lucien's visit and the
curiosity of the baroness.</p>

<p id="id05123">"You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars?" the count
inquired of Albert de Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id05124">"Yes, count, you know what I told you?"</p>

<p id="id05125">"All remains the same, then, in that quarter?"</p>

<p id="id05126">"It is more than ever a settled thing," said Lucien,&#8212;and, considering
that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make,
he adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold headed
cane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms and
the pictures.</p>

<p id="id05127">"Ah," said Monte Cristo "I did not expect that the affair would be so
promptly concluded."</p>

<p id="id05128">"Oh, things take their course without our assistance. While we are
forgetting them, they are falling into their appointed order; and
when, again, our attention is directed to them, we are surprised at
the progress they have made towards the proposed end. My father and M.
Danglars served together in Spain, my father in the army and M. Danglars
in the commissariat department. It was there that my father, ruined by
the revolution, and M. Danglars, who never had possessed any patrimony,
both laid the foundations of their different fortunes."</p>

<p id="id05129">"Yes," said Monte Cristo "I think M. Danglars mentioned that in a visit
which I paid him; and," continued he, casting a side-glance at Lucien,
who was turning over the leaves of an album, "Mademoiselle Eugenie is
pretty&#8212;I think I remember that to be her name."</p>

<p id="id05130">"Very pretty, or rather, very beautiful," replied Albert, "but of that
style of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an ungrateful fellow."</p>

<p id="id05131">"You speak as if you were already her husband."</p>

<p id="id05132">"Ah," returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was
doing.</p>

<p id="id05133">"Really," said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, "you do not appear to
me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage."</p>

<p id="id05134">"Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me," replied Morcerf, "and that
frightens me."</p>

<p id="id05135">"Bah," exclaimed Monte Cristo, "that's a fine reason to give. Are you
not rich yourself?"</p>

<p id="id05136">"My father's income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he will give
me, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry."</p>

<p id="id05137">"That, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in Paris
especially," said the count; "but everything does not depend on wealth,
and it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a high station
in society. Your name is celebrated, your position magnificent; and
then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is pleasing to see
the integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin;
disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can
shine. As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most
suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her." Albert
shook his head, and looked thoughtful. "There is still something else,"
said he.</p>

<p id="id05138">"I confess," observed Monte Cristo, "that I have some difficulty in
comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and
beautiful."</p>

<p id="id05139">"Oh," said Morcerf, "this repugnance, if repugnance it may be called, is
not all on my side."</p>

<p id="id05140">"Whence can it arise, then? for you told me your father desired the
marriage."</p>

<p id="id05141">"It is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating judgment,
and does not smile on the proposed union. I cannot account for it, but
she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars."</p>

<p id="id05142">"Ah," said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, "that may be easily
explained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and refinement
itself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with
one of ignoble birth; that is natural enough."</p>

<p id="id05143">"I do not know if that is her reason," said Albert, "but one thing I
do know, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render her quite
miserable. There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order
to talk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack of
indisposition"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05144">"Real?" interrupted the count, smiling.</p>

<p id="id05145">"Oh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,&#8212;at any rate they postponed
the matter for two months. There is no hurry, you know. I am not yet
twenty-one, and Eugenie is only seventeen; but the two months expire
next week. It must be done. My dear count, you cannot imagine how my
mind is harassed. How happy you are in being exempt from all this!"</p>

<p id="id05146">"Well, and why should not you be free, too? What prevents you from being
so?"</p>

<p id="id05147">"Oh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not
marry Mademoiselle Danglars."</p>

<p id="id05148">"Marry her then," said the count, with a significant shrug of the
shoulders.</p>

<p id="id05149">"Yes," replied Morcerf, "but that will plunge my mother into positive
grief."</p>

<p id="id05150">"Then do not marry her," said the count.</p>

<p id="id05151">"Well, I shall see. I will try and think over what is the best thing
to be done; you will give me your advice, will you not, and if possible
extricate me from my unpleasant position? I think, rather than give pain
to my dear mother, I would run the risk of offending the count." Monte
Cristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark. "Ah," said he
to Debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at the farthest
extremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right hand and an
account book in his left, "what are you doing there? Are you making a
sketch after Poussin?"</p>

<p id="id05152">"Oh, no," was the tranquil response; "I am too fond of art to attempt
anything of that sort. I am doing a little sum in arithmetic."</p>

<p id="id05153">"In arithmetic?"</p>

<p id="id05154">"Yes; I am calculating&#8212;by the way, Morcerf, that indirectly concerns
you&#8212;I am calculating what the house of Danglars must have gained by the
last rise in Haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days,
and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must have made
300,000 livres."</p>

<p id="id05155">"That is not his biggest scoop," said Morcerf; "did he not make a
million in Spaniards this last year?"</p>

<p id="id05156">"My dear fellow," said Lucien, "here is the Count of Monte Cristo, who
will say to you, as the Italians do,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05157">"'Danaro e santita, Meta della meta.' [*]</p>

<p id="id05158">     * "Money and sanctity, Each in a moiety.</p>

<p id="id05159">"When they tell me such things, I only shrug my shoulders and say
nothing."</p>

<p id="id05160">"But you were speaking of Haitians?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05161">"Ah, Haitians,&#8212;that is quite another thing! Haitians are the ecarte
of French stock-jobbing. We may like bouillotte, delight in whist, be
enraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we always
come back to ecarte&#8212;it is not only a game, it is a hors-d'oeuvre! M.
Danglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs. Had he but
waited till to-day, the price would have fallen to 205, and instead of
gaining 300,000 francs, he would have lost 20 or 25,000."</p>

<p id="id05162">"And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?" asked Monte<br>

Cristo. "I am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing intrigues."<br></p>

<p id="id05163">"Because," said Albert, laughing, "one piece of news follows another,
and there is often great dissimilarity between them."</p>

<p id="id05164">"Ah," said the count, "I see that M. Danglars is accustomed to play at
gaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must be enormously rich."</p>

<p id="id05165">"It is not he who plays!" exclaimed Lucien; "it is Madame Danglars: she
is indeed daring."</p>

<p id="id05166">"But you who are a reasonable being, Lucien, and who knows how
little dependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the
fountain-head, surely you ought to prevent it," said Morcerf, with a
smile.</p>

<p id="id05167">"How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?" asked Lucien; "you
know the character of the baroness&#8212;no one has any influence with her,
and she does precisely what she pleases."</p>

<p id="id05168">"Ah, if I were in your place"&#8212;said Albert.</p>

<p id="id05169">"Well?"</p>

<p id="id05170">"I would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future
son-in-law."</p>

<p id="id05171">"How would you set about it?"</p>

<p id="id05172">"Ah, that would be easy enough&#8212;I would give her a lesson."</p>

<p id="id05173">"A lesson?"</p>

<p id="id05174">"Yes. Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority
great on the subject of political news; you never open your mouth but
the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words. Cause her to lose a
hundred thousand francs, and that would teach her prudence."</p>

<p id="id05175">"I do not understand," stammered Lucien.</p>

<p id="id05176">"It is very clear, notwithstanding," replied the young man, with an
artlessness wholly free from affectation; "tell her some fine morning
an unheard-of piece of intelligence&#8212;some telegraphic despatch, of
which you alone are in possession; for instance, that Henri IV. was
seen yesterday at Gabrielle's. That would boom the market; she will
buy heavily, and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces the
following day, in his gazette, 'The report circulated by some usually
well-informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at Gabrielle's
house, is totally without foundation. We can positively assert that his
majesty did not quit the Pont-Neuf.'" Lucien half smiled. Monte
Cristo, although apparently indifferent, had not lost one word of this
conversation, and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret
in the embarrassed manner of the secretary. This embarrassment had
completely escaped Albert, but it caused Lucien to shorten his visit;
he was evidently ill at ease. The count, in taking leave of him, said
something in a low voice, to which he answered, "Willingly, count; I
accept." The count returned to young Morcerf.</p>

<p id="id05177">"Do you not think, on reflection," said he to him, "that you have done
wrong in thus speaking of your mother-in-law in the presence of M.
Debray?"</p>

<p id="id05178">"My dear count," said Morcerf, "I beg of you not to apply that title so
prematurely."</p>

<p id="id05179">"Now, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so very
much averse to this marriage?"</p>

<p id="id05180">"So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my
mother, has not, I think, visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole
life."</p>

<p id="id05181">"Then," said the count, "I am emboldened to speak openly to you.
M. Danglars is my banker; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with
politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune
enabled me to render him. I predict from all this an avalanche of
dinners and routs. Now, in order not to presume on this, and also to be
beforehand with them, I have, if agreeable to you, thought of
inviting M. and Madame Danglars, and M. and Madame de Villefort, to
my country-house at Auteuil. If I were to invite you and the Count and
Countess of Morcerf to this dinner, I should give it the appearance of
being a matrimonial meeting, or at least Madame de Morcerf would look
upon the affair in that light, especially if Baron Danglars did me the
honor to bring his daughter. In that case your mother would hold me in
aversion, and I do not at all wish that; on the contrary, I desire to
stand high in her esteem."</p>

<p id="id05182">"Indeed, count," said Morcerf, "I thank you sincerely for having used so
much candor towards me, and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you
propose. You say you desire my mother's good opinion; I assure you it is
already yours to a very unusual extent."</p>

<p id="id05183">"Do you think so?" said Monte Cristo, with interest.</p>

<p id="id05184">"Oh, I am sure of it; we talked of you an hour after you left us the
other day. But to return to what we were saying. If my mother could know
of this attention on your part&#8212;and I will venture to tell her&#8212;I am
sure that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father
will be equally angry." The count laughed. "Well," said he to Morcerf,
"but I think your father will not be the only angry one; M. and Madame
Danglars will think me a very ill-mannered person. They know that I
am intimate with you&#8212;that you are, in fact; one of the oldest of my
Parisian acquaintances&#8212;and they will not find you at my house; they
will certainly ask me why I did not invite you. Be sure to provide
yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of
probability, and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing. You
know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid."</p>

<p id="id05185">"I will do better than that," said Albert; "my mother is wishing to go
to the sea-side&#8212;what day is fixed for your dinner?"</p>

<p id="id05186">"Saturday."</p>

<p id="id05187">"This is Tuesday&#8212;well, to-morrow evening we leave, and the day after we
shall be at Treport. Really, count, you have a delightful way of setting
people at their ease."</p>

<p id="id05188">"Indeed, you give me more credit than I deserve; I only wish to do what
will be agreeable to you, that is all."</p>

<p id="id05189">"When shall you send your invitations?"</p>

<p id="id05190">"This very day."</p>

<p id="id05191">"Well, I will immediately call on M. Danglars, and tell him that my
mother and myself must leave Paris to-morrow. I have not seen you,
consequently I know nothing of your dinner."</p>

<p id="id05192">"How foolish you are! Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just seen
you at my house?"</p>

<p id="id05193">"Ah, true."</p>

<p id="id05194">"Fix it this way. I have seen you, and invited you without any ceremony,
when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to
accept, as you were going to Treport."</p>

<p id="id05195">"Well, then, that is settled; but you will come and call on my mother
before to-morrow?"</p>

<p id="id05196">"Before to-morrow?&#8212;that will be a difficult matter to arrange, besides,<br>

I shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure."<br></p>

<p id="id05197">"Well, you can do better. You were only a charming man before, but, if
you accede to my proposal, you will be adorable."</p>

<p id="id05198">"What must I do to attain such sublimity?"</p>

<p id="id05199">"You are to-day free as air&#8212;come and dine with me; we shall be a
small party&#8212;only yourself, my mother, and I. You have scarcely seen my
mother; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely.
She is a remarkable woman, and I only regret that there does not exist
another like her, about twenty years younger; in that case, I assure
you, there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf. As
to my father, you will not see him; he is officially engaged, and dines
with the chief referendary. We will talk over our travels; and you, who
have seen the whole world, will relate your adventures&#8212;you shall tell
us the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other
night at the Opera, and whom you call your slave, and yet treat like a
princess. We will talk Italian and Spanish. Come, accept my invitation,
and my mother will thank you."</p>

<p id="id05200">"A thousand thanks," said the count, "your invitation is most gracious,
and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it. I am
not so much at liberty as you suppose; on the contrary, I have a most
important engagement."</p>

<p id="id05201">"Ah, take care, you were teaching me just now how, in case of an
invitation to dinner, one might creditably make an excuse. I require the
proof of a pre-engagement. I am not a banker, like M. Danglars, but I am
quite as incredulous as he is."</p>

<p id="id05202">"I am going to give you a proof," replied the count, and he rang the
bell.</p>

<p id="id05203">"Humph," said Morcerf, "this is the second time you have refused to dine
with my mother; it is evident that you wish to avoid her." Monte Cristo
started. "Oh, you do not mean that," said he; "besides, here comes the
confirmation of my assertion." Baptistin entered, and remained standing
at the door. "I had no previous knowledge of your visit, had I?"</p>

<p id="id05204">"Indeed, you are such an extraordinary person, that I would not answer
for it."</p>

<p id="id05205">"At all events, I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner."</p>

<p id="id05206">"Probably not."</p>

<p id="id05207">"Well, listen, Baptistin, what did I tell you this morning when I called
you into my laboratory?"</p>

<p id="id05208">"To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five,"
replied the valet.</p>

<p id="id05209">"What then?"</p>

<p id="id05210">"Ah, my dear count," said Albert.</p>

<p id="id05211">"No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have
given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred.
I wish my life to be free and open. Go on, Baptistin."</p>

<p id="id05212">"Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son."</p>

<p id="id05213">"You hear&#8212;Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti&#8212;a man who ranks amongst the most
ancient nobility of Italy, whose name Dante has celebrated in the tenth
canto of 'The Inferno,' you remember it, do you not? Then there is his
son, Andrea, a charming young man, about your own age, viscount,
bearing the same title as yourself, and who is making his entry into the
Parisian world, aided by his father's millions. The major will bring his
son with him this evening, the contino, as we say in Italy; he confides
him to my care. If he proves himself worthy of it, I will do what I can
to advance his interests. You will assist me in the work, will you not?"</p>

<p id="id05214">"Most undoubtedly. This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours,
then?"</p>

<p id="id05215">"By no means. He is a perfect nobleman, very polite, modest, and
agreeable, such as may be found constantly in Italy, descendants of very
ancient families. I have met him several times at Florence, Bologna
and Lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in
Paris. The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on
one; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once
paid them by chance, as though the civilities of a passing hour were
likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose
society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey. This
good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris, which he
only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire, when he was on
his way to Moscow. I shall give him a good dinner, he will confide his
son to my care, I will promise to watch over him, I shall let him follow
in whatever path his folly may lead him, and then I shall have done my
part."</p>

<p id="id05216">"Certainly; I see you are a model Mentor," said Albert "Good-by, we
shall return on Sunday. By the way, I have received news of Franz."</p>

<p id="id05217">"Have you? Is he still amusing himself in Italy?"</p>

<p id="id05218">"I believe so; however, he regrets your absence extremely. He says you
were the sun of Rome, and that without you all appears dark and cloudy;
I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains."</p>

<p id="id05219">"His opinion of me is altered for the better, then?"</p>

<p id="id05220">"No, he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible
and mysterious of beings."</p>

<p id="id05221">"He is a charming young man," said Monte Cristo "and I felt a lively
interest in him the very first evening of my introduction, when I met
him in search of a supper, and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of
mine. He is, I think, the son of General d'Epinay?"</p>

<p id="id05222">"He is."</p>

<p id="id05223">"The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?"</p>

<p id="id05224">"By the Bonapartists."</p>

<p id="id05225">"Yes. Really I like him extremely; is there not also a matrimonial
engagement contemplated for him?"</p>

<p id="id05226">"Yes, he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort."</p>

<p id="id05227">"Indeed?"</p>

<p id="id05228">"And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars," said Albert,
laughing.</p>

<p id="id05229">"You smile."</p>

<p id="id05230">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05231">"Why do you do so?"</p>

<p id="id05232">"I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for
the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own.
But really, my dear count, we are talking as much of women as they do of
us; it is unpardonable." Albert rose.</p>

<p id="id05233">"Are you going?"</p>

<p id="id05234">"Really, that is a good idea!&#8212;two hours have I been boring you to death
with my company, and then you, with the greatest politeness, ask me if I
am going. Indeed, count, you are the most polished man in the world.
And your servants, too, how very well behaved they are; there is quite a
style about them. Monsieur Baptistin especially; I could never get such
a man as that. My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a
play, who, because they have only a word or two to say, aquit themselves
in the most awkward manner possible. Therefore, if you part with M.
Baptistin, give me the refusal of him."</p>

<p id="id05235">"By all means."</p>

<p id="id05236">"That is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese,
Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing
to establish his son, find him a wife very rich, very noble on her
mother's side at least, and a baroness in right of her father, I will
help you in the search."</p>

<p id="id05237">"Ah, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?"</p>

<p id="id05238">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05239">"Well, really, nothing is certain in this world."</p>

<p id="id05240">"Oh, count, what a service you might render me! I should like you a
hundred times better if, by your intervention, I could manage to remain
a bachelor, even were it only for ten years."</p>

<p id="id05241">"Nothing is impossible," gravely replied Monte Cristo; and taking leave
of Albert, he returned into the house, and struck the gong three times.
Bertuccio appeared. "Monsieur Bertuccio, you understand that I intend
entertaining company on Saturday at Auteuil." Bertuccio slightly
started. "I shall require your services to see that all be properly
arranged. It is a beautiful house, or at all events may be made so."</p>

<p id="id05242">"There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title, your
excellency, for the tapestried hangings are very old."</p>

<p id="id05243">"Let them all be taken away and changed, then, with the exception of
the sleeping-chamber which is hung with red damask; you will leave
that exactly as it is." Bertuccio bowed. "You will not touch the garden
either; as to the yard, you may do what you please with it; I should
prefer that being altered beyond all recognition."</p>

<p id="id05244">"I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes, your
excellency. I should be glad, however, to receive your excellency's
commands concerning the dinner."</p>

<p id="id05245">"Really, my dear M. Bertuccio," said the count, "since you have been
in Paris, you have become quite nervous, and apparently out of your
element; you no longer seem to understand me."</p>

<p id="id05246">"But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are
expecting to receive?"</p>

<p id="id05247">"I do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should do
so. 'Lucullus dines with Lucullus,' that is quite sufficient." Bertuccio
bowed, and left the room.</p>

<h2 id="id05248" style="margin-top: 3em">Chapter 55. Major Cavalcanti.</h2>

<p id="id05249">Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to
Morcerf the proposed visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo
as a pretext for declining Albert's invitation. Seven o'clock had just
struck, and M. Bertuccio, according to the command which had been given
him, had two hours before left for Auteuil, when a cab stopped at the
door, and after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately hurried
away, as if ashamed of its employment. The visitor was about fifty-two
years of age, dressed in one of the green surtouts, ornamented with
black frogs, which have so long maintained their popularity all over
Europe. He wore trousers of blue cloth, boots tolerably clean, but not
of the brightest polish, and a little too thick in the soles, buckskin
gloves, a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by
the gendarmes, and a black cravat striped with white, which, if the
proprietor had not worn it of his own free will, might have passed for a
halter, so much did it resemble one. Such was the picturesque costume of
the person who rang at the gate, and demanded if it was not at No. 30 in
the Avenue des Champs-Elysees that the Count of Monte Cristo lived, and
who, being answered by the porter in the affirmative, entered, closed
the gate after him, and began to ascend the steps.</p>

<p id="id05250">The small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray
mustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had
received an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was
awaiting him in the hall. Therefore, scarcely had the stranger time to
pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. He was
ushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to
meet him with a smiling air. "Ah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; I
was expecting you."</p>

<p id="id05251">"Indeed," said the Italian, "was your excellency then aware of my
visit?"</p>

<p id="id05252">"Yes; I had been told that I should see you to-day at seven o'clock."</p>

<p id="id05253">"Then you have received full information concerning my arrival?"</p>

<p id="id05254">"Of course."</p>

<p id="id05255">"Ah, so much the better, I feared this little precaution might have been
forgotten."</p>

<p id="id05256">"What precaution?"</p>

<p id="id05257">"That of informing you beforehand of my coming."</p>

<p id="id05258">"Oh, no, it has not."</p>

<p id="id05259">"But you are sure you are not mistaken."</p>

<p id="id05260">"Very sure."</p>

<p id="id05261">"It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven o'clock this
evening?"</p>

<p id="id05262">"I will prove it to you beyond a doubt."</p>

<p id="id05263">"Oh, no, never mind that," said the Italian; "it is not worth the
trouble."</p>

<p id="id05264">"Yes, yes," said Monte Cristo. His visitor appeared slightly uneasy.<br>

"Let me see," said the count; "are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo<br>

Cavalcanti?"<br></p>

<p id="id05265">"Bartolomeo Cavalcanti," joyfully replied the Italian; "yes, I am really
he."</p>

<p id="id05266">"Ex-major in the Austrian service?"</p>

<p id="id05267">"Was I a major?" timidly asked the old soldier.</p>

<p id="id05268">"Yes," said Monte Cristo "you were a major; that is the title the French
give to the post which you filled in Italy."</p>

<p id="id05269">"Very good," said the major, "I do not demand more, you understand"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05270">"Your visit here to-day is not of your own suggestion, is it?" said<br>

Monte Cristo.<br></p>

<p id="id05271">"No, certainly not."</p>

<p id="id05272">"You were sent by some other person?"</p>

<p id="id05273">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05274">"By the excellent Abbe Busoni?"</p>

<p id="id05275">"Exactly so," said the delighted major.</p>

<p id="id05276">"And you have a letter?"</p>

<p id="id05277">"Yes, there it is."</p>

<p id="id05278">"Give it me, then;" and Monte Cristo took the letter, which he opened
and read. The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes,
and then took a survey of the apartment, but his gaze almost immediately
reverted to the proprietor of the room. "Yes, yes, I see. 'Major
Cavalcanti, a worthy patrician of Lucca, a descendant of the Cavalcanti
of Florence,'" continued Monte Cristo, reading aloud, "'possessing an
income of half a million.'" Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper,
and bowed. "Half a million," said he, "magnificent!"</p>

<p id="id05279">"Half a million, is it?" said the major.</p>

<p id="id05280">"Yes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abbe knows correctly
the amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe."</p>

<p id="id05281">"Be it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, I had no idea that
it was so much."</p>

<p id="id05282">"Because you are robbed by your steward. You must make some reformation
in that quarter."</p>

<p id="id05283">"You have opened my eyes," said the Italian gravely; "I will show the
gentlemen the door." Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05284">"'And who only needs one thing more to make him happy.'"</p>

<p id="id05285">"Yes, indeed but one!" said the major with a sigh.</p>

<p id="id05286">"'Which is to recover a lost and adored son.'"</p>

<p id="id05287">"A lost and adored son!"</p>

<p id="id05288">"'Stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble family or
by the gypsies.'"</p>

<p id="id05289">"At the age of five years!" said the major with a deep sigh, and raising
his eye to heaven.</p>

<p id="id05290">"Unhappy father," said Monte Cristo. The count continued:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05291">"'I have given him renewed life and hope, in the assurance that you have
the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen
years.'" The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression
of anxiety. "I have the power of so doing," said Monte Cristo. The major
recovered his self-possession. "So, then," said he, "the letter was true
to the end?"</p>

<p id="id05292">"Did you doubt it, my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo?"</p>

<p id="id05293">"No, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious office,
as does the Abbe Busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play off a
joke; but your excellency has not read all."</p>

<p id="id05294">"Ah, true," said Monte Cristo "there is a postscript."</p>

<p id="id05295">"Yes, yes," repeated the major, "yes&#8212;there&#8212;is&#8212;a&#8212;postscript."</p>

<p id="id05296">"'In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his
banker, I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling
expenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which
you still owe me.'" The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript,
apparently with great anxiety. "Very good," said the count.</p>

<p id="id05297">"He said 'very good,'" muttered the major, "then&#8212;sir"&#8212;replied he.</p>

<p id="id05298">"Then what?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05299">"Then the postscript"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05300">"Well; what of the postscript?"</p>

<p id="id05301">"Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the
letter?"</p>

<p id="id05302">"Certainly; the Abbe Busoni and myself have a small account open between
us. I do not remember if it is exactly 48,000. francs, which I am still
owing him, but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference. You
attached great importance, then, to this postscript, my dear Monsieur
Cavalcanti?"</p>

<p id="id05303">"I must explain to you," said the major, "that, fully confiding in the
signature of the Abbe Busoni, I had not provided myself with any other
funds; so that if this resource had failed me, I should have found
myself very unpleasantly situated in Paris."</p>

<p id="id05304">"Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed
anywhere?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05305">"Why, really I know no one," said the major.</p>

<p id="id05306">"But then you yourself are known to others?"</p>

<p id="id05307">"Yes, I am known, so that"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05308">"Proceed, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti."</p>

<p id="id05309">"So that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?"</p>

<p id="id05310">"Certainly, at your first request." The major's eyes dilated with
pleasing astonishment. "But sit down," said Monte Cristo; "really I
do not know what I have been thinking of&#8212;I have positively kept you
standing for the last quarter of an hour."</p>

<p id="id05311">"Don't mention it." The major drew an arm-chair towards him, and
proceeded to seat himself.</p>

<p id="id05312">"Now," said the count, "what will you take&#8212;a glass of port, sherry, or<br>

Alicante?"<br></p>

<p id="id05313">"Alicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine."</p>

<p id="id05314">"I have some that is very good. You will take a biscuit with it, will
you not?"</p>

<p id="id05315">"Yes, I will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging."</p>

<p id="id05316">Monte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared. The count advanced to meet him.
"Well?" said he in a low voice. "The young man is here," said the valet
de chambre in the same tone.</p>

<p id="id05317">"Into what room did you take him?"</p>

<p id="id05318">"Into the blue drawing-room, according to your excellency's orders."</p>

<p id="id05319">"That's right; now bring the Alicante and some biscuits."</p>

<p id="id05320">Baptistin left the room. "Really," said the major, "I am quite ashamed
of the trouble I am giving you."</p>

<p id="id05321">"Pray don't mention such a thing," said the count. Baptistin re-entered
with glasses, wine, and biscuits. The count filled one glass, but in the
other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored liquid. The bottle
was covered with spiders' webs, and all the other signs which indicate
the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man's face. The major
made a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit. The count told
Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest, who began by
sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction, and then
delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine.</p>

<p id="id05322">"So, sir, you lived at Lucca, did you? You were rich, noble, held in
great esteem&#8212;had all that could render a man happy?"</p>

<p id="id05323">"All," said the major, hastily swallowing his biscuit, "positively all."</p>

<p id="id05324">"And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your
happiness?"</p>

<p id="id05325">"Only one thing," said the Italian.</p>

<p id="id05326">"And that one thing, your lost child."</p>

<p id="id05327">"Ah," said the major, taking a second biscuit, "that consummation of
my happiness was indeed wanting." The worthy major raised his eyes to
heaven and sighed.</p>

<p id="id05328">"Let me hear, then," said the count, "who this deeply regretted son was;
for I always understood you were a bachelor."</p>

<p id="id05329">"That was the general opinion, sir," said the major, "and I"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05330">"Yes," replied the count, "and you confirmed the report. A youthful
indiscretion, I suppose, which you were anxious to conceal from the
world at large?" The major recovered himself, and resumed his usual calm
manner, at the same time casting his eyes down, either to give himself
time to compose his countenance, or to assist his imagination, all the
while giving an under-look at the count, the protracted smile on whose
lips still announced the same polite curiosity. "Yes," said the major,
"I did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye."</p>

<p id="id05331">"Not on your own account, surely," replied Monte Cristo; "for a man is
above that sort of thing?"</p>

<p id="id05332">"Oh, no, certainly not on my own account," said the major with a smile
and a shake of the head.</p>

<p id="id05333">"But for the sake of the mother?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id05334">"Yes, for the mother's sake&#8212;his poor mother!" cried the major, taking a
third biscuit.</p>

<p id="id05335">"Take some more wine, my dear Cavalcanti," said the count, pouring out
for him a second glass of Alicante; "your emotion has quite overcome
you."</p>

<p id="id05336">"His poor mother," murmured the major, trying to get the lachrymal gland
in operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear.</p>

<p id="id05337">"She belonged to one of the first families in Italy, I think, did she
not?"</p>

<p id="id05338">"She was of a noble family of Fiesole, count."</p>

<p id="id05339">"And her name was"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05340">"Do you desire to know her name?"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05341">"Oh," said Monte Cristo "it would be quite superfluous for you to tell
me, for I already know it."</p>

<p id="id05342">"The count knows everything," said the Italian, bowing.</p>

<p id="id05343">"Oliva Corsinari, was it not?"</p>

<p id="id05344">"Oliva Corsinari."</p>

<p id="id05345">"A marchioness?"</p>

<p id="id05346">"A marchioness."</p>

<p id="id05347">"And you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her
family?"</p>

<p id="id05348">"Yes, that was the way it ended."</p>

<p id="id05349">"And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?" said Monte<br>

Cristo.<br></p>

<p id="id05350">"What papers?"</p>

<p id="id05351">"The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari, and the register
of your child's birth."</p>

<p id="id05352">"The register of my child's birth?"</p>

<p id="id05353">"The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcanti&#8212;of your son; is not his
name Andrea?"</p>

<p id="id05354">"I believe so," said the major.</p>

<p id="id05355">"What? You believe so?"</p>

<p id="id05356">"I dare not positively assert it, as he has been lost for so long a
time."</p>

<p id="id05357">"Well, then," said Monte Cristo "you have all the documents with you?"</p>

<p id="id05358">"Your excellency, I regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary to
come provided with these papers, I neglected to bring them."</p>

<p id="id05359">"That is unfortunate," returned Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05360">"Were they, then, so necessary?"</p>

<p id="id05361">"They were indispensable."</p>

<p id="id05362">The major passed his hand across his brow. "Ah, per Bacco,
indispensable, were they?"</p>

<p id="id05363">"Certainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the
validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?"</p>

<p id="id05364">"True," said the major, "there might be doubts raised."</p>

<p id="id05365">"In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated."</p>

<p id="id05366">"It would be fatal to his interests."</p>

<p id="id05367">"It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance."</p>

<p id="id05368">"O peccato!"</p>

<p id="id05369">"You must know that in France they are very particular on these points;
it is not sufficient, as in Italy, to go to the priest and say, 'We love
each other, and want you to marry us.' Marriage is a civil affair in
France, and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers
which undeniably establish your identity."</p>

<p id="id05370">"That is the misfortune! You see I have not these necessary papers."</p>

<p id="id05371">"Fortunately, I have them, though," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05372">"You?"</p>

<p id="id05373">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id05374">"You have them?"</p>

<p id="id05375">"I have them."</p>

<p id="id05376">"Ah, indeed?" said the major, who, seeing the object of his journey
frustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his
forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000
francs&#8212;"ah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes, that really
is lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them."</p>

<p id="id05377">"I do not at all wonder at it&#8212;one cannot think of everything; but,
happily, the Abbe Busoni thought for you."</p>

<p id="id05378">"He is an excellent person."</p>

<p id="id05379">"He is extremely prudent and thoughtful."</p>

<p id="id05380">"He is an admirable man," said the major; "and he sent them to you?"</p>

<p id="id05381">"Here they are."</p>

<p id="id05382">The major clasped his hands in token of admiration. "You married Oliva
Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del Monte-Cattini; here is the
priest's certificate."</p>

<p id="id05383">"Yes indeed, there it is truly," said the Italian, looking on with
astonishment.</p>

<p id="id05384">"And here is Andrea Cavalcanti's baptismal register, given by the curate
of Saravezza."</p>

<p id="id05385">"All quite correct."</p>

<p id="id05386">"Take these documents, then; they do not concern me. You will give them
to your son, who will, of course, take great care of them."</p>

<p id="id05387">"I should think so, indeed! If he were to lose them"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05388">"Well, and if he were to lose them?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05389">"In that case," replied the major, "it would be necessary to write to
the curate for duplicates, and it would be some time before they could
be obtained."</p>

<p id="id05390">"It would be a difficult matter to arrange," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05391">"Almost an impossibility," replied the major.</p>

<p id="id05392">"I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers."</p>

<p id="id05393">"I regard them as invaluable."</p>

<p id="id05394">"Now," said Monte Cristo "as to the mother of the young man"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05395">"As to the mother of the young man"&#8212;repeated the Italian, with anxiety.</p>

<p id="id05396">"As regards the Marchesa Corsinari"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05397">"Really," said the major, "difficulties seem to thicken upon us; will
she be wanted in any way?"</p>

<p id="id05398">"No, sir," replied Monte Cristo; "besides, has she not"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05399">"Yes, sir," said the major, "she has"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05400">"Paid the last debt of nature?"</p>

<p id="id05401">"Alas, yes," returned the Italian.</p>

<p id="id05402">"I knew that," said Monte Cristo; "she has been dead these ten years."</p>

<p id="id05403">"And I am still mourning her loss," exclaimed the major, drawing from
his pocket a checked handkerchief, and alternately wiping first the left
and then the right eye.</p>

<p id="id05404">"What would you have?" said Monte Cristo; "we are all mortal. Now, you
understand, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, that it is useless for you to
tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for
fifteen years. Stories of gypsies, who steal children, are not at all in
vogue in this part of the world, and would not be believed. You sent him
for his education to a college in one of the provinces, and now you wish
him to complete his education in the Parisian world. That is the reason
which has induced you to leave Via Reggio, where you have lived since
the death of your wife. That will be sufficient."</p>

<p id="id05405">"You think so?"</p>

<p id="id05406">"Certainly."</p>

<p id="id05407">"Very well, then."</p>

<p id="id05408">"If they should hear of the separation"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05409">"Ah, yes; what could I say?"</p>

<p id="id05410">"That an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your family"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05411">"By the Corsinari?"</p>

<p id="id05412">"Precisely. Had stolen away this child, in order that your name might
become extinct."</p>

<p id="id05413">"That is reasonable, since he is an only son."</p>

<p id="id05414">"Well, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened
remembrances be forgotten. You have, doubtless, already guessed that I
was preparing a surprise for you?"</p>

<p id="id05415">"An agreeable one?" asked the Italian.</p>

<p id="id05416">"Ah, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his
heart."</p>

<p id="id05417">"Hum!" said the major.</p>

<p id="id05418">"Some one has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he was
here."</p>

<p id="id05419">"That who was here?"</p>

<p id="id05420">"Your child&#8212;your son&#8212;your Andrea!"</p>

<p id="id05421">"I did guess it," replied the major with the greatest possible coolness.<br>

"Then he is here?"<br></p>

<p id="id05422">"He is," said Monte Cristo; "when the valet de chambre came in just now,
he told me of his arrival."</p>

<p id="id05423">"Ah, very well, very well," said the major, clutching the buttons of his
coat at each exclamation.</p>

<p id="id05424">"My dear sir," said Monte Cristo, "I understand your emotion; you must
have time to recover yourself. I will, in the meantime, go and prepare
the young man for this much-desired interview, for I presume that he is
not less impatient for it than yourself."</p>

<p id="id05425">"I should quite imagine that to be the case," said Cavalcanti.</p>

<p id="id05426">"Well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you."</p>

<p id="id05427">"You will bring him, then? You carry your goodness so far as even to
present him to me yourself?"</p>

<p id="id05428">"No; I do not wish to come between a father and son. Your interview will
be private. But do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of nature
should be silent, you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by this
door. He is a fine young man, of fair complexion&#8212;a little too fair,
perhaps&#8212;pleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for yourself."</p>

<p id="id05429">"By the way," said the major, "you know I have only the 2,000 francs
which the Abbe Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon travelling
expenses, and"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05430">"And you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M. Cavalcanti.<br>

Well, here are 8,000 francs on account."<br></p>

<p id="id05431">The major's eyes sparkled brilliantly.</p>

<p id="id05432">"It is 40,000 francs which I now owe you," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05433">"Does your excellency wish for a receipt?" said the major, at the same
time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.</p>

<p id="id05434">"For what?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id05435">"I thought you might want it to show the Abbe Busoni."</p>

<p id="id05436">"Well, when you receive the remaining 40,000, you shall give me a
receipt in full. Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I
think, quite unnecessary."</p>

<p id="id05437">"Yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people."</p>

<p id="id05438">"One word more," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05439">"Say on."</p>

<p id="id05440">"You will permit me to make one remark?"</p>

<p id="id05441">"Certainly; pray do so."</p>

<p id="id05442">"Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress."</p>

<p id="id05443">"Indeed," said the major, regarding himself with an air of complete
satisfaction.</p>

<p id="id05444">"Yes. It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however elegant in
itself, has long been out of fashion in Paris."</p>

<p id="id05445">"That's unfortunate."</p>

<p id="id05446">"Oh, if you really are attached to your old mode of dress; you can
easily resume it when you leave Paris."</p>

<p id="id05447">"But what shall I wear?"</p>

<p id="id05448">"What you find in your trunks."</p>

<p id="id05449">"In my trunks? I have but one portmanteau."</p>

<p id="id05450">"I dare say you have nothing else with you. What is the use of boring
one's self with so many things? Besides an old soldier always likes to
march with as little baggage as possible."</p>

<p id="id05451">"That is just the case&#8212;precisely so."</p>

<p id="id05452">"But you are a man of foresight and prudence, therefore you sent your
luggage on before you. It has arrived at the Hotel des Princes, Rue de
Richelieu. It is there you are to take up your quarters."</p>

<p id="id05453">"Then, in these trunks"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05454">"I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all
you are likely to need,&#8212;your plain clothes and your uniform. On grand
occasions you must wear your uniform; that will look very well. Do not
forget your crosses. They still laugh at them in France, and yet always
wear them, for all that."</p>

<p id="id05455">"Very well, very well," said the major, who was in ecstasy at the
attention paid him by the count.</p>

<p id="id05456">"Now," said Monte Cristo, "that you have fortified yourself against all
painful excitement, prepare yourself, my dear M. Cavalcanti, to meet
your lost Andrea." Saying which Monte Cristo bowed, and disappeared
behind the tapestry, leaving the major fascinated beyond expression
with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the
count.</p>

<p id="id05458">The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room, which Baptistin
had designated as the drawing-room, and found there a young man, of
graceful demeanor and elegant appearance, who had arrived in a cab
about half an hour previously. Baptistin had not found any difficulty in
recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance.
He was certainly the tall young man with light hair, red beard, black
eyes, and brilliant complexion, whom his master had so particularly
described to him. When the count entered the room the young man was
carelessly stretched on a sofa, tapping his boot with the gold-headed
cane which he held in his hand. On perceiving the count he rose quickly.
"The Count of Monte Cristo, I believe?" said he.</p>

<p id="id05459">"Yes, sir, and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea<br>

Cavalcanti?"<br></p>

<p id="id05460">"Count Andrea Cavalcanti," repeated the young man, accompanying his
words with a bow.</p>

<p id="id05461">"You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me, are you
not?" said the count.</p>

<p id="id05462">"I did not mention that, because the signature seemed to me so strange."</p>

<p id="id05463">"The letter signed 'Sinbad the Sailor,' is it not?"</p>

<p id="id05464">"Exactly so. Now, as I have never known any Sinbad, with the exception
of the one celebrated in the 'Thousand and One Nights'"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05465">"Well, it is one of his descendants, and a great friend of mine; he is a
very rich Englishman, eccentric almost to insanity, and his real name is
Lord Wilmore."</p>

<p id="id05466">"Ah, indeed? Then that explains everything that is extraordinary,"
said Andrea. "He is, then, the same Englishman whom I met&#8212;at&#8212;ah&#8212;yes,
indeed. Well, monsieur, I am at your service."</p>

<p id="id05467">"If what you say be true," replied the count, smiling, "perhaps you will
be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family?"</p>

<p id="id05468">"Certainly, I will do so," said the young man, with a quickness which
gave proof of his ready invention. "I am (as you have said) the Count
Andrea Cavalcanti, son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a descendant of
the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at Florence.
Our family, although still rich (for my father's income amounts to half
a million), has experienced many misfortunes, and I myself was, at the
age of five years, taken away by the treachery of my tutor, so that for
fifteen years I have not seen the author of my existence. Since I have
arrived at years of discretion and become my own master, I have been
constantly seeking him, but all in vain. At length I received this
letter from your friend, which states that my father is in Paris, and
authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him."</p>

<p id="id05469">"Really, all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting," said<br>

Monte Cristo, observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction; "and<br>

you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend<br>

Sinbad; for your father is indeed here, and is seeking you."<br></p>

<p id="id05470">The count from the moment of first entering the drawing-room, had not
once lost sight of the expression of the young man's countenance; he had
admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice; but at
these words, so natural in themselves, "Your father is indeed here, and
is seeking you," young Andrea started, and exclaimed, "My father? Is my
father here?"</p>

<p id="id05471">"Most undoubtedly," replied Monte Cristo; "your father, Major Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti." The expression of terror which, for the moment, had
overspread the features of the young man, had now disappeared. "Ah, yes,
that is the name, certainly. Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti. And you really
mean to say; monsieur, that my dear father is here?"</p>

<p id="id05472">"Yes, sir; and I can even add that I have only just left his company.
The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the
quick; indeed, his griefs, hopes, and fears on that subject might
furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem. At length, he
one day received a letter, stating that the abductors of his son now
offered to restore him, or at least to give notice where he might be
found, on condition of receiving a large sum of money, by way of ransom.
Your father did not hesitate an instant, and the sum was sent to the
frontier of Piedmont, with a passport signed for Italy. You were in the
south of France, I think?"</p>

<p id="id05473">"Yes," replied Andrea, with an embarrassed air, "I was in the south of<br>

France."<br></p>

<p id="id05474">"A carriage was to await you at Nice?"</p>

<p id="id05475">"Precisely so; and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa, from Genoa to
Turin, from Turin to Chambery, from Chambery to Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and
from Pont-de-Beauvoisin to Paris."</p>

<p id="id05476">"Indeed? Then your father ought to have met with you on the road, for it
is exactly the same route which he himself took, and that is how we have
been able to trace your journey to this place."</p>

<p id="id05477">"But," said Andrea, "if my father had met me, I doubt if he would have
recognized me; I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me."</p>

<p id="id05478">"Oh, the voice of nature," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p id="id05479">"True," interrupted the young man, "I had not looked upon it in that
light."</p>

<p id="id05480">"Now," replied Monte Cristo "there is only one source of uneasiness left
in your father's mind, which is this&#8212;he is anxious to know how you
have been employed during your long absence from him, how you have
been treated by your persecutors, and if they have conducted themselves
towards you with all the deference due to your rank. Finally, he is
anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral
influence to which you have been exposed, and which is infinitely more
to be dreaded than any physical suffering; he wishes to discover if the
fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by
want of culture; and, in short, whether you consider yourself capable of
resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank
entitles you."</p>

<p id="id05481">"Sir!" exclaimed the young man, quite astounded, "I hope no false
report"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id05482">"As for myself, I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore, the
philanthropist. I believe he found you in some unpleasant position, but
do not know of what nature, for I did not ask, not being inquisitive.
Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies, so you see you must have
been interesting. He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the
position which you had lost, and that he would seek your father until he
found him. He did seek, and has found him, apparently, since he is here
now; and, finally, my friend apprised me of your coming, and gave me a
few other instructions relative to your future fortune. I am quite aware
that my friend Wilmore is peculiar, but he is sincere, and as rich as a
gold-mine, consequently, he may indulge his eccentricities without
any fear of their ruining him, and I have promised to adhere to his
instructions. Now, sir, pray do not be offended at the question I am
about to put to you, as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron.
I would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to
you&#8212;misfortunes entirely beyond your control, and which in no degree
diminish my regard for you&#8212;I would wish to know if they have not, in
some measure, contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which
your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure?"</p>

<p id="id05483">"Sir," returned the young man, with a reassurance of manner, "make
your mind easy on this score. Those who took me from my father, and
who always intended, sooner or later, to sell me again to my original
proprietor, as they have now done, calculated that, in order to make the
most of their bargain, it would be politic to leave me in possession of
all my personal and hereditary worth, and even to increase the value,
if possible. I have, therefore, received a very good education, and have
been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated
in Asia Minor, whose masters made them grammarians, doctors, and
philosophers, in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman
market." Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction; it appeared as if he had
not expected so much from M. Andrea Cavalcanti. "Besides," continued
the young man, "if there did appear some defect in education, or offence
against the established forms of etiquette, I suppose it would be
excused, in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth,
and followed me through my youth."</p>

<p id="id05484">"Well," said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone, "you will do as you
please, count, for you are the master of your own actions, and are the
person most concerned in the matter, but if I were you, I would not
divulge a word of these adventures. Your history is quite a romance,
and the world, which delights in romances in yellow covers, strangely
mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment, even though they be
gilded like yourself. This is the kind of difficulty which I wished
to represent to you, my dear count. You would hardly have recited your
touching history before it would go forth to the world, and be deemed
unlikely and unnatural. You would be no longer a lost child found,
but you would be looked upon as an upstart, who had sprung up like a
mushroom in the night. You might excite a little curiosity, but it is
not every one who likes to be made the centre of observation and the
subject of unpleasant remark."</p>

<p id="id05485">"I agree with you, monsieur," said the young man, turning pale, and,
in spite of himself, trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his
companion, "such consequences would be extremely unpleasant."</p>

<p id="id05486">"Nevertheless, you must not exaggerate the evil," said Monte Cristo,
"for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another. You
must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct, and for a man
of your intelligence, this plan is as easy as it is necessary; you must
form honorable friendships, and by that means counteract the prejudice
which may attach to the obscurity of your former life." Andrea visibly
changed countenance. "I would offer myself as your surety and friendly
adviser," said Monte Cristo, "did I not possess a moral distrust of my
best friends, and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them
too; therefore, in departing from this rule, I should (as the actors
say) be playing a part quite out of my line, and should, therefore, run
the risk of being hissed, which would be an act of folly."</p>

<p id="id05487">"However, your excellency," said Andrea, "in consideration of Lord<br>

Wilmore, by whom I was recommended to you&#8212;"<br></p>

<p id="id05488">"Yes, certainly," interrupted Monte Cristo; "but Lord Wilmore did not
omit to inform me, my dear M. Andrea, that the season of your youth was
rather a stormy one. Ah," said the count, watching Andrea's countenance,
"I do not demand any confession from you; it is precisely to avoid that
necessity that your father was sent for from Lucca. You shall soon
see him. He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner, and he is
disfigured by his uniform; but when it becomes known that he has been
for eighteen years in the Austrian service, all that will be pardoned.
We are not generally very severe with the Austrians. In short, you will
find your father a very presentable person, I assure you."</p>

<p id="id05489">"Ah, sir, you have given me confidence; it is so long since we were
separated, that I have not the least remembrance of him, and, besides,
you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all
defects."</p>

<p id="id05490">"He is a millionaire&#8212;his income is 500,000 francs."</p>

<p id="id05491">"Then," said the young man, with anxiety, "I shall be sure to be placed
in an agreeable position."</p>

<p id="id05492">"One of the most agreeable possible, my dear sir; he will allow you an
income of 50,000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in
Paris."</p>

<p id="id05493">"Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there."</p>

<p id="id05494">"You cannot control circumstances, my dear sir; 'man proposes, and God
disposes.'" Andrea sighed. "But," said he, "so long as I do remain in
Paris, and nothing forces me to quit it, do you mean to tell me that I
may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me?"</p>

<p id="id05495">"You may."</p>

<p id="id05496">"Shall I receive it from my father?" asked Andrea, with some uneasiness.</p>

<p id="id05497">"Yes, you will receive it from your father personally, but Lord Wilmore
will be the security for the money. He has, at the request of your
father, opened an account of 6,000. francs a month at M. Danglars',
which is one of the safest banks in Paris."</p>

<p id="id05498">"And does my father mean to remain long in Paris?" asked Andrea.</p>

<p id="id05499">"Only a few days," replied Monte Cristo. "His service does not allow him
to absent himself more than two or three weeks together."</p>

<p id="id05500">"Ah, my dear father!" exclaimed Andrea, evidently charmed with the idea
of his speedy departure.</p>

<p id="id05501">"Therefore," said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his
meaning&#8212;"therefore I will not, for another instant, retard the pleasure
of your meeting. Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father?"</p>

<p id="id05502">"I hope you do not doubt it."</p>

<p id="id05503">"Go, then, into the drawing-room, my young friend, where you will find
your father awaiting you." Andrea made a low bow to the count,
and entered the adjoining room. Monte Cristo watched him till he
disappeared, and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a
picture, which, in sliding partly from the frame, discovered to view
a small opening, so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was
passing in the drawing-room now occupied by Cavalcanti and Andrea. The
young man closed the door behind him, and advanced towards the major,
who had risen when he heard steps approaching him. "Ah, my dear father!"
said Andrea in a loud voice, in order that the count might hear him in
the next room, "is it really you?"</p>

<p id="id05504">"How do you do, my dear son?" said the major gravely.</p>

<p id="id05505">"After so many years of painful separation," said Andrea, in the same
tone of voice, and glancing towards the door, "what a happiness it is to
meet again!"</p>

<p id="id05506">"Indeed it is, after so long a separation."</p>

<p id="id05507">"Will you not embrace me, sir?" said Andrea.</p>

<p id="id05508">"If you wish it, my son," said the major; and the two men embraced each
other after the fashion of actors on the stage; that is to say, each
rested his head on the other's shoulder.</p>

<p id="id05509">"Then we are once more reunited?" said Andrea.</p>

<p id="id05510">"Once more," replied the major.</p>

<p id="id05511">"Never more to be separated?"</p>

<p id="id05512">"Why, as to that&#8212;I think, my dear son, you must be by this time so
accustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country."</p>

<p id="id05513">"The fact is," said the young man, "that I should be exceedingly grieved
to leave it."</p>

<p id="id05514">"As for me, you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca; therefore<br>

I shall return to Italy as soon as I can."<br></p>

<p id="id05515">"But before you leave France, my dear father, I hope you will put me
in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my
descent."</p>

<p id="id05516">"Certainly; I am come expressly on that account; it has cost me much
trouble to find you, but I had resolved on giving them into your hands,
and if I had to recommence my search, it would occupy all the few
remaining years of my life."</p>

<p id="id05517">"Where are these papers, then?"</p>

<p id="id05518">"Here they are."</p>

<p id="id05519">Andrea seized the certificate of his father's marriage and his own
baptismal register, and after having opened them with all the eagerness
which might be expected under the circumstances, he read them with a
facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents, and
with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the
contents. When he had perused the documents, an indefinable expression
of pleasure lighted up his countenance, and looking at the major with a
most peculiar smile, he said, in very excellent Tuscan,&#8212;"Then there is
no longer any such thing, in Italy as being condemned to the galleys?"
The major drew himself up to his full height.</p>
