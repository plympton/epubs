<p id="id11258">"Count," said Morrel, in a firm and at the same time soft voice, "listen
to me, as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven, though he
remains on earth; I come to die in the arms of a friend. Certainly,
there are people whom I love. I love my sister Julie,&#8212;I love her
husband Emmanuel; but I require a strong mind to smile on my last
moments. My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting; I could not
bear to see her suffer. Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand, and
alarm the house with his cries. You, count, who are more than mortal,
will, I am sure, lead me to death by a pleasant path, will you not?"</p>

<p id="id11259">"My friend," said the count, "I have still one doubt,&#8212;are you weak
enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings?"</p>

<p id="id11260">"No, indeed,&#8212;I am calm," said Morrel, giving his hand to the count; "my
pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual. No, I feel that I have
reached the goal, and I will go no farther. You told me to wait and
hope; do you know what you did, unfortunate adviser? I waited a month,
or rather I suffered for a month! I did hope (man is a poor wretched
creature), I did hope. What I cannot tell,&#8212;something wonderful, an
absurdity, a miracle,&#8212;of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled
with our reason that folly we call hope. Yes, I did wait&#8212;yes, I did
hope, count, and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking
together, you have unconsciously wounded, tortured my heart, for every
word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me. Oh, count,
I shall sleep calmly, deliciously in the arms of death." Morrel uttered
these words with an energy which made the count shudder. "My friend,"
continued Morrel, "you named the fifth of October as the end of the
period of waiting,&#8212;to-day is the fifth of October," he took out his
watch, "it is now nine o'clock,&#8212;I have yet three hours to live."</p>

<p id="id11261">"Be it so," said the count, "come." Morrel mechanically followed the
count, and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it. He felt
a carpet under his feet, a door opened, perfumes surrounded him, and
a brilliant light dazzled his eyes. Morrel hesitated to advance; he
dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw. Monte Cristo drew him
in gently. "Why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to
us of life, like those ancient Romans, who when condemned by Nero, their
emperor and heir, sat down at a table covered with flowers, and gently
glided into death, amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses?" Morrel
smiled. "As you please," he said; "death is always death,&#8212;that is
forgetfulness, repose, exclusion from life, and therefore from grief."
He sat down, and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to him. They were
in the marvellous dining-room before described, where the statues had
baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers. Morrel had
looked carelessly around, and had probably noticed nothing.</p>

<p id="id11262">"Let us talk like men," he said, looking at the count.</p>

<p id="id11263">"Go on!"</p>

<p id="id11264">"Count," said Morrel, "you are the epitome of all human knowledge, and
you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world
than ours."</p>

<p id="id11265">"There is something true in what you say," said the count, with that
smile which made him so handsome; "I have descended from a planet called
grief."</p>

<p id="id11266">"I believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning; for
instance, you told me to live, and I did live; you told me to hope,
and I almost did so. I am almost inclined to ask you, as though you had
experienced death, 'is it painful to die?'"</p>

<p id="id11267">Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tenderness. "Yes,"
he said, "yes, doubtless it is painful, if you violently break the outer
covering which obstinately begs for life. If you plunge a dagger into
your flesh, if you insinuate a bullet into your brain, which the least
shock disorders,&#8212;then certainly, you will suffer pain, and you will
repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price."</p>

<p id="id11268">"Yes; I know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death, as well
as in life; the only thing is to understand it."</p>

<p id="id11269">"You have spoken truly, Maximilian; according to the care we bestow upon
it, death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse, or an enemy
who violently drags the soul from the body. Some day, when the world
is much older, and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive
powers in nature, to serve for the general good of humanity; when
mankind, as you were just saying, have discovered the secrets of death,
then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the
arms of your beloved."</p>

<p id="id11270">"And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?"</p>

<p id="id11271">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id11272">Morrel extended his hand. "Now I understand," he said, "why you had me
brought here to this desolate spot, in the midst of the ocean, to this
subterranean palace; it was because you loved me, was it not, count? It
was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means
of death of which we were speaking; a death without agony, a death which
allows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine's name and pressing
your hand."</p>

<p id="id11273">"Yes, you have guessed rightly, Morrel," said the count, "that is what I
intended."</p>

<p id="id11274">"Thanks; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer, is sweet to my
heart."</p>

<p id="id11275">"Do you then regret nothing?"</p>

<p id="id11276">"No," replied Morrel.</p>

<p id="id11277">"Not even me?" asked the count with deep emotion. Morrel's clear eye was
for the moment clouded, then it shone with unusual lustre, and a large
tear rolled down his cheek.</p>

<p id="id11278">"What," said the count, "do you still regret anything in the world, and
yet die?"</p>

<p id="id11279">"Oh, I entreat you," exclaimed Morrel in a low voice, "do not speak
another word, count; do not prolong my punishment." The count fancied
that he was yielding, and this belief revived the horrible doubt that
had overwhelmed him at the Chateau d'If. "I am endeavoring," he thought,
"to make this man happy; I look upon this restitution as a weight thrown
into the scale to balance the evil I have wrought. Now, supposing I
am deceived, supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit
happiness. Alas, what would become of me who can only atone for evil by
doing good?" Then he said aloud: "Listen, Morrel, I see your grief
is great, but still you do not like to risk your soul." Morrel smiled
sadly. "Count," he said, "I swear to you my soul is no longer my own."</p>

<p id="id11280">"Maximilian, you know I have no relation in the world. I have accustomed
myself to regard you as my son: well, then, to save my son, I will
sacrifice my life, nay, even my fortune."</p>

<p id="id11281">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id11282">"I mean, that you wish to quit life because you do not understand
all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune. Morrel, I
possess nearly a hundred millions and I give them to you; with such a
fortune you can attain every wish. Are you ambitious? Every career is
open to you. Overturn the world, change its character, yield to mad
ideas, be even criminal&#8212;but live."</p>

<p id="id11283">"Count, I have your word," said Morrel coldly; then taking out his
watch, he added, "It is half-past eleven."</p>

<p id="id11284">"Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?"</p>

<p id="id11285">"Then let me go," said Maximilian, "or I shall think you did not love me
for my own sake, but for yours;" and he arose.</p>

<p id="id11286">"It is well," said Monte Cristo whose countenance brightened at these
words; "you wish&#8212;you are inflexible. Yes, as you said, you are indeed
wretched and a miracle alone can cure you. Sit down, Morrel, and wait."</p>

<p id="id11287">Morrel obeyed; the count arose, and unlocking a closet with a key
suspended from his gold chain, took from it a little silver casket,
beautifully carved and chased, the corners of which represented four
bending figures, similar to the Caryatides, the forms of women, symbols
of the angels aspiring to heaven. He placed the casket on the table;
then opening it took out a little golden box, the top of which flew
open when touched by a secret spring. This box contained an unctuous
substance partly solid, of which it was impossible to discover the
color, owing to the reflection of the polished gold, sapphires, rubies,
emeralds, which ornamented the box. It was a mixed mass of blue, red,
and gold. The count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon,
and offered it to Morrel, fixing a long steadfast glance upon him. It
was then observable that the substance was greenish.</p>

<p id="id11288">"This is what you asked for," he said, "and what I promised to give
you."</p>

<p id="id11289">"I thank you from the depths of my heart," said the young man, taking
the spoon from the hands of Monte Cristo. The count took another spoon,
and again dipped it into the golden box. "What are you going to do, my
friend?" asked Morrel, arresting his hand.</p>

<p id="id11290">"Well, the fact is, Morrel, I was thinking that I too am weary of life,
and since an opportunity presents itself"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11291">"Stay!" said the young man. "You who love, and are beloved; you, who
have faith and hope,&#8212;oh, do not follow my example. In your case it
would be a crime. Adieu, my noble and generous friend, adieu; I will
go and tell Valentine what you have done for me." And slowly, though
without any hesitation, only waiting to press the count's hand
fervently, he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by Monte
Cristo. Then they were both silent. Ali, mute and attentive, brought the
pipes and coffee, and disappeared. By degrees, the light of the lamps
gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them, and
the perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel. Seated opposite to him,
Monte Cristo watched him in the shadow, and Morrel saw nothing but the
bright eyes of the count. An overpowering sadness took possession of
the young man, his hands relaxed their hold, the objects in the room
gradually lost their form and color, and his disturbed vision seemed to
perceive doors and curtains open in the walls.</p>

<p id="id11292">"Friend," he cried, "I feel that I am dying; thanks!" He made a last
effort to extend his hand, but it fell powerless beside him. Then it
appeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled, not with the strange and
fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of
his heart, but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child.
At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature, his form,
nearly double its usual height, stood out in relief against the red
tapestry, his black hair was thrown back, and he stood in the attitude
of an avenging angel. Morrel, overpowered, turned around in the
arm-chair; a delicious torpor permeated every vein. A change of
ideas presented themselves to his brain, like a new design on
the kaleidoscope. Enervated, prostrate, and breathless, he became
unconscious of outward objects; he seemed to be entering that vague
delirium preceding death. He wished once again to press the count's
hand, but his own was immovable. He wished to articulate a last
farewell, but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat, like
a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre. Involuntarily his languid eyes
closed, and still through his eyelashes a well-known form seemed to move
amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped.</p>

<p id="id11293">The count had just opened a door. Immediately a brilliant light from the
next room, or rather from the palace adjoining, shone upon the room in
which he was gently gliding into his last sleep. Then he saw a woman of
marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the
two rooms. Pale, and sweetly smiling, she looked like an angel of mercy
conjuring the angel of vengeance. "Is it heaven that opens before me?"
thought the dying man; "that angel resembles the one I have lost." Monte
Cristo pointed out Morrel to the young woman, who advanced towards him
with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips.</p>

<p id="id11294">"Valentine, Valentine!" he mentally ejaculated; but his lips uttered
no sound, and as though all his strength were centred in that internal
emotion, he sighed and closed his eyes. Valentine rushed towards him;
his lips again moved.</p>

<p id="id11295">"He is calling you," said the count; "he to whom you have confided your
destiny&#8212;he from whom death would have separated you, calls you to him.
Happily, I vanquished death. Henceforth, Valentine, you will never
again be separated on earth, since he has rushed into death to find you.
Without me, you would both have died. May God accept my atonement in the
preservation of these two existences!"</p>

<p id="id11296">Valentine seized the count's hand, and in her irresistible impulse of
joy carried it to her lips.</p>

<p id="id11297">"Oh, thank me again!" said the count; "tell me till you are weary, that
I have restored you to happiness; you do not know how much I require
this assurance."</p>

<p id="id11298">"Oh, yes, yes, I thank you with all my heart," said Valentine; "and if
you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude, oh, then, ask Haidee! ask my
beloved sister Haidee, who ever since our departure from France, has
caused me to wait patiently for this happy day, while talking to me of
you."</p>

<p id="id11299">"You then love Haidee?" asked Monte Cristo with an emotion he in vain
endeavored to dissimulate.</p>

<p id="id11300">"Oh, yes, with all my soul."</p>

<p id="id11301">"Well, then, listen, Valentine," said the count; "I have a favor to ask
of you."</p>

<p id="id11302">"Of me? Oh, am I happy enough for that?"</p>

<p id="id11303">"Yes; you have called Haidee your sister,&#8212;let her become so indeed,
Valentine; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me;
protect her, for" (the count's voice was thick with emotion) "henceforth
she will be alone in the world."</p>

<p id="id11304">"Alone in the world!" repeated a voice behind the count, "and why?"</p>

<p id="id11305">Monte Cristo turned around; Haidee was standing pale, motionless,
looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement.</p>

<p id="id11306">"Because to-morrow, Haidee, you will be free; you will then assume
your proper position in society, for I will not allow my destiny to
overshadow yours. Daughter of a prince, I restore to you the riches and
name of your father."</p>

<p id="id11307">Haidee became pale, and lifting her transparent hands to heaven,
exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears, "Then you leave me, my lord?"</p>

<p id="id11308">"Haidee, Haidee, you are young and beautiful; forget even my name, and
be happy."</p>

<p id="id11309">"It is well," said Haidee; "your order shall be executed, my lord;
I will forget even your name, and be happy." And she stepped back to
retire.</p>

<p id="id11310">"Oh, heavens," exclaimed Valentine, who was supporting the head of
Morrel on her shoulder, "do you not see how pale she is? Do you not see
how she suffers?"</p>

<p id="id11311">Haidee answered with a heartrending expression, "Why should he
understand this, my sister? He is my master, and I am his slave; he has
the right to notice nothing."</p>

<p id="id11312">The count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost
recesses of his heart; his eyes met those of the young girl and he could
not bear their brilliancy. "Oh, heavens," exclaimed Monte Cristo, "can
my suspicions be correct? Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?"</p>

<p id="id11313">"I am young," gently replied Haidee; "I love the life you have made so
sweet to me, and I should be sorry to die."</p>

<p id="id11314">"You mean, then, that if I leave you, Haidee"&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11315">"I should die; yes, my lord."</p>

<p id="id11316">"Do you then love me?"</p>

<p id="id11317">"Oh, Valentine, he asks if I love him. Valentine, tell him if you love
Maximilian." The count felt his heart dilate and throb; he opened his
arms, and Haidee, uttering a cry, sprang into them. "Oh, yes," she
cried, "I do love you! I love you as one loves a father, brother,
husband! I love you as my life, for you are the best, the noblest of
created beings!"</p>

<p id="id11318">"Let it be, then, as you wish, sweet angel; God has sustained me in my
struggle with my enemies, and has given me this reward; he will not let
me end my triumph in suffering; I wished to punish myself, but he has
pardoned me. Love me then, Haidee! Who knows? perhaps your love will
make me forget all that I do not wish to remember."</p>

<p id="id11319">"What do you mean, my lord?"</p>

<p id="id11320">"I mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years
of slow experience; I have but you in the world, Haidee; through you
I again take hold on life, through you I shall suffer, through you
rejoice."</p>

<p id="id11321">"Do you hear him, Valentine?" exclaimed Haidee; "he says that through me
he will suffer&#8212;through me, who would yield my life for his." The count
withdrew for a moment. "Have I discovered the truth?" he said; "but
whether it be for recompense or punishment, I accept my fate. Come,
Haidee, come!" and throwing his arm around the young girl's waist, he
pressed the hand of Valentine, and disappeared.</p>

<p id="id11322">An hour had nearly passed, during which Valentine, breathless and
motionless, watched steadfastly over Morrel. At length she felt his
heart beat, a faint breath played upon his lips, a slight shudder,
announcing the return of life, passed through the young man's frame. At
length his eyes opened, but they were at first fixed and expressionless;
then sight returned, and with it feeling and grief. "Oh," he cried, in
an accent of despair, "the count has deceived me; I am yet living;" and
extending his hand towards the table, he seized a knife.</p>

<p id="id11323">"Dearest," exclaimed Valentine, with her adorable smile, "awake, and
look at me!" Morrel uttered a loud exclamation, and frantic, doubtful,
dazzled, as though by a celestial vision, he fell upon his knees.</p>

<p id="id11324">The next morning at daybreak, Valentine and Morrel were walking
arm-in-arm on the sea-shore, Valentine relating how Monte Cristo had
appeared in her room, explained everything, revealed the crime, and,
finally, how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death.
They had found the door of the grotto opened, and gone forth; on the
azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars. Morrel soon
perceived a man standing among the rocks, apparently awaiting a sign
from them to advance, and pointed him out to Valentine. "Ah, it is
Jacopo," she said, "the captain of the yacht;" and she beckoned him
towards them.</p>

<p id="id11325">"Do you wish to speak to us?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p id="id11326">"I have a letter to give you from the count."</p>

<p id="id11327">"From the count!" murmured the two young people.</p>

<p id="id11328">"Yes; read it." Morrel opened the letter, and read:&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11329">"My Dear Maximilian,&#8212;</p>

<p id="id11330">"There is a felucca for you at anchor. Jacopo will carry you to Leghorn,
where Monsieur Noirtier awaits his granddaughter, whom he wishes to
bless before you lead her to the altar. All that is in this grotto, my
friend, my house in the Champs Elysees, and my chateau at Treport, are
the marriage gifts bestowed by Edmond Dantes upon the son of his old
master, Morrel. Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them with you; for
I entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her
from her father, now a madman, and her brother who died last September
with his mother. Tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny,
Morrel, to pray sometimes for a man, who like Satan thought himself
for an instant equal to God, but who now acknowledges with Christian
humility that God alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom.
Perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart. As
for you, Morrel, this is the secret of my conduct towards you. There is
neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison
of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest
grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt
what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of
living.</p>

<p id="id11331">"Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never
forget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future
to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words,&#8212;'<i>Wait and
hope</i>.'&#8212;Your friend,</p>

<p id="id11332">"Edmond Dantes, Count of Monte Cristo."</p>

<p id="id11333">During the perusal of this letter, which informed Valentine for the
first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother,
she became pale, a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom, and tears, not
the less painful because they were silent, ran down her cheeks; her
happiness cost her very dear. Morrel looked around uneasily. "But," he
said, "the count's generosity is too overwhelming; Valentine will be
satisfied with my humble fortune. Where is the count, friend? Lead me
to him." Jacopo pointed towards the horizon. "What do you mean?" asked
Valentine. "Where is the count?&#8212;where is Haidee?"</p>

<p id="id11334">"Look!" said Jacopo.</p>

<p id="id11335">The eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor, and
on the blue line separating the sky from the Mediterranean Sea, they
perceived a large white sail. "Gone," said Morrel; "gone!&#8212;adieu, my
friend&#8212;adieu, my father!"</p>

<p id="id11336">"Gone," murmured Valentine; "adieu, my sweet Haidee&#8212;adieu, my sister!"</p>

<p id="id11337">"Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?" said Morrel with
tearful eyes.</p>

<p id="id11338">"Darling," replied Valentine, "has not the count just told us that all
human wisdom is summed up in two words?&#8212;'<i>Wait and hope</i>.'"</p>
