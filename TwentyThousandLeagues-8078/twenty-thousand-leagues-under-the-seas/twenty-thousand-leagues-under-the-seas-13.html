<h6 id="id02804">The Underwater Coalfields</h6>

<p id="id02805">THE NEXT DAY, February 20, I overslept.  I was so exhausted
from the night before, I didn't get up until eleven o'clock. I
dressed quickly.  I hurried to find out the Nautilus's heading.
The instruments indicated that it was running southward at a speed
of twenty miles per hour and a depth of 100 meters.</p>

<p id="id02806">Conseil entered.  I described our nocturnal excursion to him,
and since the panels were open, he could still catch a glimpse
of this submerged continent.</p>

<p id="id02807">In fact, the Nautilus was skimming only ten meters over the soil of
these Atlantis plains.  The ship scudded along like an air balloon borne
by the wind over some prairie on land; but it would be more accurate
to say that we sat in the lounge as if we were riding in a coach
on an express train.  As for the foregrounds passing before our eyes,
they were fantastically carved rocks, forests of trees that had
crossed over from the vegetable kingdom into the mineral kingdom,
their motionless silhouettes sprawling beneath the waves.
There also were stony masses buried beneath carpets of axidia
and sea anemone, bristling with long, vertical water plants,
then strangely contoured blocks of lava that testified to all the fury
of those plutonic developments.</p>

<p id="id02808">While this bizarre scenery was glittering under our
electric beams, I told Conseil the story of the Atlanteans, who had
inspired the old French scientist Jean Bailly to write so many
entertaining&#8212; albeit utterly
fictitious&#8212;pages.<a id="noteref-6b"
href="twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-seas-18.html#note-6b">[6]</a>
I told the lad about the wars of these heroic people.  I discussed the
question of Atlantis with the fervor of a man who no longer had any
doubts.  But Conseil was so distracted he barely heard me, and his
lack of interest in any commentary on this historical topic was soon
explained.</p>

<p id="id02810">In essence, numerous fish had caught his eye, and when fish pass by,
Conseil vanishes into his world of classifying and leaves real
life behind.  In which case I could only tag along and resume
our ichthyological research.</p>

<p id="id02811">Even so, these Atlantic fish were not noticeably different from those we
had observed earlier.  There were rays of gigantic size, five meters
long and with muscles so powerful they could leap above the waves,
sharks of various species including a fifteen-foot glaucous shark
with sharp triangular teeth and so transparent it was almost invisible
amid the waters, brown lantern sharks, prism-shaped humantin sharks
armored with protuberant hides, sturgeons resembling their relatives
in the Mediterranean, trumpet-snouted pipefish a foot and a half long,
yellowish brown with small gray fins and no teeth or tongue,
unreeling like slim, supple snakes.</p>

<p id="id02812">Among bony fish, Conseil noticed some blackish marlin three
meters long with a sharp sword jutting from the upper jaw,
bright-colored weevers known in Aristotle's day as sea dragons
and whose dorsal stingers make them quite dangerous to pick up,
then dolphinfish with brown backs striped in blue and edged in gold,
handsome dorados, moonlike opahs that look like azure disks but which
the sun's rays turn into spots of silver, finally eight-meter swordfish
from the genus Xiphias, swimming in schools, sporting yellowish
sickle-shaped fins and six-foot broadswords, stalwart animals,
plant eaters rather than fish eaters, obeying the tiniest signals
from their females like henpecked husbands.</p>

<p id="id02813">But while observing these different specimens of marine fauna,
I didn't stop examining the long plains of Atlantis.  Sometimes an
unpredictable irregularity in the seafloor would force the Nautilus
to slow down, and then it would glide into the narrow channels
between the hills with a cetacean's dexterity.  If the labyrinth
became hopelessly tangled, the submersible would rise above it
like an airship, and after clearing the obstacle, it would resume
its speedy course just a few meters above the ocean floor.
It was an enjoyable and impressive way of navigating that did indeed
recall the maneuvers of an airship ride, with the major difference
that the Nautilus faithfully obeyed the hands of its helmsman.</p>

<p id="id02814">The terrain consisted mostly of thick slime mixed with petrified branches,
but it changed little by little near four o'clock in the afternoon;
it grew rockier and seemed to be strewn with pudding stones and a basaltic
gravel called "tuff," together with bits of lava and sulfurous obsidian.
I expected these long plains to change into mountain regions,
and in fact, as the Nautilus was executing certain turns,
I noticed that the southerly horizon was blocked by a high wall
that seemed to close off every exit.  Its summit obviously
poked above the level of the ocean.  It had to be a continent
or at least an island, either one of the Canaries or one of the
Cape Verde Islands.  Our bearings hadn't been marked on the chart&#8212;
perhaps deliberately&#8212;and I had no idea what our position was.
In any case this wall seemed to signal the end of Atlantis, of which,
all in all, we had crossed only a small part.</p>

<p id="id02815">Nightfall didn't interrupt my observations.  I was left to myself.
Conseil had repaired to his cabin.  The Nautilus slowed down,
hovering above the muddled masses on the seafloor, sometimes grazing
them as if wanting to come to rest, sometimes rising unpredictably
to the surface of the waves.  Then I glimpsed a few bright
constellations through the crystal waters, specifically five or six
of those zodiacal stars trailing from the tail end of Orion.</p>

<p id="id02816">I would have stayed longer at my window, marveling at these beauties
of sea and sky, but the panels closed.  Just then the Nautilus had
arrived at the perpendicular face of that high wall.  How the ship
would maneuver I hadn't a guess.  I repaired to my stateroom.
The Nautilus did not stir.  I fell asleep with the firm intention
of waking up in just a few hours.</p>

<p id="id02817">But it was eight o'clock the next day when I returned to the lounge.
I stared at the pressure gauge.  It told me that the Nautilus was
afloat on the surface of the ocean.  Furthermore, I heard the sound
of footsteps on the platform.  Yet there were no rolling movements
to indicate the presence of waves undulating above me.</p>

<p id="id02818">I climbed as far as the hatch.  It was open.  But instead of
the broad daylight I was expecting, I found that I was surrounded
by total darkness.  Where were we?  Had I been mistaken?
Was it still night?  No!  Not one star was twinkling, and nighttime
is never so utterly black.</p>

<p id="id02819">I wasn't sure what to think, when a voice said to me:</p>

<p id="id02820">"Is that you, professor?"</p>

<p id="id02821">"Ah, Captain Nemo!"  I replied.  "Where are we?"</p>

<p id="id02822">"Underground, professor."</p>

<p id="id02823">"Underground!"  I exclaimed.  "And the Nautilus is still floating?"</p>

<p id="id02824">"It always floats."</p>

<p id="id02825">"But I don't understand!"</p>

<p id="id02826">"Wait a little while.  Our beacon is about to go on, and if you
want some light on the subject, you'll be satisfied."</p>

<p id="id02827">I set foot on the platform and waited.  The darkness was so profound
I couldn't see even Captain Nemo.  However, looking at the zenith
directly overhead, I thought I caught sight of a feeble glimmer,
a sort of twilight filtering through a circular hole.
Just then the beacon suddenly went on, and its intense brightness
made that hazy light vanish.</p>

<p id="id02828">This stream of electricity dazzled my eyes, and after momentarily
shutting them, I looked around.  The Nautilus was stationary.
It was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf.
As for the water now buoying the ship, it was a lake completely encircled
by an inner wall about two miles in diameter, hence six miles around.
Its level&#8212;as indicated by the pressure gauge&#8212;would be the same
as the outside level, because some connection had to exist
between this lake and the sea.  Slanting inward over their base,
these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense
upside-down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height.
At its summit there gaped the circular opening through which I
had detected that faint glimmer, obviously daylight.</p>

<p id="id02829">Before more carefully examining the interior features of this
enormous cavern, and before deciding if it was the work of nature
or humankind, I went over to Captain Nemo.</p>

<p id="id02830">"Where are we?"  I said.</p>

<p id="id02831">"In the very heart of an extinct volcano," the captain answered me,
"a volcano whose interior was invaded by the sea after some convulsion
in the earth.  While you were sleeping, professor, the Nautilus
entered this lagoon through a natural channel that opens ten meters
below the surface of the ocean.  This is our home port, secure,
convenient, secret, and sheltered against winds from any direction!
Along the coasts of your continents or islands, show me any
offshore mooring that can equal this safe refuge for withstanding
the fury of hurricanes."</p>

<p id="id02832">"Indeed," I replied, "here you're in perfect safety,<br/>

Captain Nemo.  Who could reach you in the heart of a volcano?<br/>

But don't I see an opening at its summit?"<br/></p>

<p id="id02833">"Yes, its crater, a crater formerly filled with lava, steam, and flames,
but which now lets in this life-giving air we're breathing."</p>

<p id="id02834">"But which volcanic mountain is this?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id02835">"It's one of the many islets with which this sea is strewn.
For ships a mere reef, for us an immense cavern.  I discovered it
by chance, and chance served me well."</p>

<p id="id02836">"But couldn't someone enter through the mouth of its crater?"</p>

<p id="id02837">"No more than I could exit through it.  You can climb about 100 feet
up the inner base of this mountain, but then the walls overhang,
they lean too far in to be scaled."</p>

<p id="id02838">"I can see, captain, that nature is your obedient servant,
any time or any place.  You're safe on this lake, and nobody else
can visit its waters.  But what's the purpose of this refuge?
The Nautilus doesn't need a harbor."</p>

<p id="id02839">"No, professor, but it needs electricity to run, batteries to
generate its electricity, sodium to feed its batteries, coal to
make its sodium, and coalfields from which to dig its coal.
Now then, right at this spot the sea covers entire forests that
sank underwater in prehistoric times; today, turned to stone,
transformed into carbon fuel, they offer me inexhaustible coal mines."</p>

<p id="id02840">"So, captain, your men practice the trade of miners here?"</p>

<p id="id02841">"Precisely.  These mines extend under the waves like the coalfields
at Newcastle.  Here, dressed in diving suits, pick and mattock in hand,
my men go out and dig this carbon fuel for which I don't need a single
mine on land.  When I burn this combustible to produce sodium,
the smoke escaping from the mountain's crater gives it the appearance
of a still-active volcano."</p>

<p id="id02842">"And will we see your companions at work?"</p>

<p id="id02843">"No, at least not this time, because I'm eager to continue our
underwater tour of the world.  Accordingly, I'll rest content
with drawing on my reserve stock of sodium.  We'll stay here long
enough to load it on board, in other words, a single workday,
then we'll resume our voyage.  So, Professor Aronnax, if you'd
like to explore this cavern and circle its lagoon, seize the day."</p>

<p id="id02844">I thanked the captain and went to look for my two companions,
who hadn't yet left their cabin.  I invited them to follow me,
not telling them where we were.</p>

<p id="id02845">They climbed onto the platform.  Conseil, whom nothing could startle,
saw it as a perfectly natural thing to fall asleep under the waves
and wake up under a mountain.  But Ned Land had no idea in his head
other than to see if this cavern offered some way out.</p>

<p id="id02846">After breakfast near ten o'clock, we went down onto the embankment.</p>

<p id="id02847">"So here we are, back on shore," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id02848">"I'd hardly call this shore," the Canadian replied.  "And besides,
we aren't on it but under it."</p>

<p id="id02849">A sandy beach unfolded before us, measuring 500 feet at its widest point
between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain's walls.
Via this strand you could easily circle the lake.  But the base
of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay
picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones.
All these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by
the action of underground fires, and they glistened under the stream
of electric light from our beacon.  Stirred up by our footsteps,
the mica-rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a
cloud of sparks.</p>

<p id="id02850">The ground rose appreciably as it moved away from the sand flats
by the waves, and we soon arrived at some long, winding gradients,
genuinely steep paths that allowed us to climb little by little;
but we had to tread cautiously in the midst of pudding stones that weren't
cemented together, and our feet kept skidding on glassy trachyte,
made of feldspar and quartz crystals.</p>

<p id="id02851">The volcanic nature of this enormous pit was apparent all around us.<br/>

I ventured to comment on it to my companions.<br/></p>

<p id="id02852">"Can you picture," I asked them, "what this funnel must have
been like when it was filled with boiling lava, and the level
of that incandescent liquid rose right to the mountain's mouth,
like cast iron up the insides of a furnace?"</p>

<p id="id02853">"I can picture it perfectly," Conseil replied.  "But will master
tell me why this huge smelter suspended operations, and how it
is that an oven was replaced by the tranquil waters of a lake?"</p>

<p id="id02854">"In all likelihood, Conseil, because some convulsion created an opening
below the surface of the ocean, the opening that serves as a passageway
for the Nautilus.  Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed inside
the mountain.  There ensued a dreadful struggle between the elements
of fire and water, a struggle ending in King Neptune's favor.
But many centuries have passed since then, and this submerged
volcano has changed into a peaceful cavern."</p>

<p id="id02855">"That's fine," Ned Land answered.  "I accept the explanation,
but in our personal interests, I'm sorry this opening the professor
mentions wasn't made above sea level."</p>

<p id="id02856">"But Ned my friend," Conseil answered, "if it weren't an underwater
passageway, the Nautilus couldn't enter it!"</p>

<p id="id02857">"And I might add, Mr. Land," I said, "that the waters wouldn't have
rushed under the mountain, and the volcano would still be a volcano.
So you have nothing to be sorry about."</p>

<p id="id02858">Our climb continued.  The gradients got steeper and narrower.
Sometimes they were cut across by deep pits that had to be cleared.
Masses of overhanging rock had to be gotten around.  You slid on
your knees, you crept on your belly.  But helped by the Canadian's
strength and Conseil's dexterity, we overcame every obstacle.</p>

<p id="id02859">At an elevation of about thirty meters, the nature of the terrain
changed without becoming any easier.  Pudding stones and trachyte
gave way to black basaltic rock:  here, lying in slabs all swollen
with blisters; there, shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a
series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault,
a wonderful sample of natural architecture.  Then, among this
basaltic rock, there snaked long, hardened lava flows inlaid with veins
of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur.
The sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger,
shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried
in the heart of this extinct mountain.</p>

<p id="id02860">But when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet,
we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles.  The converging inside
walls changed into overhangs, and our climb into a circular stroll.
At this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge
the mineral kingdom.  Shrubs, and even a few trees, emerged from crevices
in the walls.  I recognized some spurges that let their caustic,
purgative sap trickle out.  There were heliotropes, very remiss
at living up to their sun-worshipping reputations since no sunlight
ever reached them; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly,
their colors and scents were faded.  Here and there chrysanthemums
sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long, sad, sickly leaves.
But between these lava flows I spotted little violets that still gave
off a subtle fragrance, and I confess that I inhaled it with delight.
The soul of a flower is its scent, and those splendid water plants,
flowers of the sea, have no souls!</p>

<p id="id02861">We had arrived at the foot of a sturdy clump of dragon trees,
which were splitting the rocks with exertions of their muscular roots,
when Ned Land exclaimed:</p>

<p id="id02862">"Oh, sir, a hive!"</p>

<p id="id02863">"A hive?"  I answered, with a gesture of utter disbelief.</p>

<p id="id02864">"Yes, a hive," the Canadian repeated, "with bees buzzing around!"</p>

<p id="id02865">I went closer and was forced to recognize the obvious.  At the mouth
of a hole cut in the trunk of a dragon tree, there swarmed thousands
of these ingenious insects so common to all the Canary Islands,
where their output is especially prized.</p>

<p id="id02866">Naturally enough, the Canadian wanted to lay in a supply of honey,
and it would have been ill-mannered of me to say no.  He mixed sulfur
with some dry leaves, set them on fire with a spark from his tinderbox,
and proceeded to smoke the bees out.  Little by little the buzzing died
down and the disemboweled hive yielded several pounds of sweet honey.
Ned Land stuffed his haversack with it.</p>

<p id="id02867">"When I've mixed this honey with our breadfruit batter," he told us,<br/>

"I'll be ready to serve you a delectable piece of cake."<br/></p>

<p id="id02868">"But of course," Conseil put in, "it will be gingerbread!"</p>

<p id="id02869">"I'm all for gingerbread," I said, "but let's resume
this fascinating stroll."</p>

<p id="id02870">At certain turns in the trail we were going along, the lake
appeared in its full expanse.  The ship's beacon lit up that whole
placid surface, which experienced neither ripples nor undulations.
The Nautilus lay perfectly still.  On its platform and on the embankment,
crewmen were bustling around, black shadows that stood out clearly
in the midst of the luminous air.</p>

<p id="id02871">Just then we went around the highest ridge of these rocky
foothills that supported the vault.  Then I saw that bees weren't
the animal kingdom's only representatives inside this volcano.
Here and in the shadows, birds of prey soared and whirled,
flying away from nests perched on tips of rock.  There were
sparrow hawks with white bellies, and screeching kestrels.
With all the speed their stiltlike legs could muster, fine fat bustards
scampered over the slopes.  I'll let the reader decide whether
the Canadian's appetite was aroused by the sight of this tasty game,
and whether he regretted having no rifle in his hands.  He tried
to make stones do the work of bullets, and after several fruitless
attempts, he managed to wound one of these magnificent bustards.
To say he risked his life twenty times in order to capture this
bird is simply the unadulterated truth; but he fared so well,
the animal went into his sack to join the honeycombs.</p>

<p id="id02872">By then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge
had become impossible.  Above us, the yawning crater looked like
the wide mouth of a well.  From where we stood, the sky was pretty easy
to see, and I watched clouds race by, disheveled by the west wind,
letting tatters of mist trail over the mountain's summit.
Proof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude,
because this volcano didn't rise more than 1,800 feet above the level
of the ocean.</p>

<p id="id02873">Half an hour after the Canadian's latest exploits, we were back
on the inner beach.  There the local flora was represented by a wide
carpet of samphire, a small umbelliferous plant that keeps quite nicely,
which also boasts the names glasswort, saxifrage, and sea fennel.
Conseil picked a couple bunches.  As for the local fauna,
it included thousands of crustaceans of every type:
lobsters, hermit crabs, prawns, mysid shrimps, daddy longlegs,
rock crabs, and a prodigious number of seashells, such as cowries,
murex snails, and limpets.</p>

<p id="id02874">In this locality there gaped the mouth of a magnificent cave.
My companions and I took great pleasure in stretching out on its
fine-grained sand.  Fire had polished the sparkling enamel of its
inner walls, sprinkled all over with mica-rich dust.  Ned Land tapped
these walls and tried to probe their thickness.  I couldn't help smiling.
Our conversation then turned to his everlasting escape plans,
and without going too far, I felt I could offer him this hope:
Captain Nemo had gone down south only to replenish his sodium supplies.
So I hoped he would now hug the coasts of Europe and America,
which would allow the Canadian to try again with a greater
chance of success.</p>

<p id="id02875">We were stretched out in this delightful cave for an hour.
Our conversation, lively at the outset, then languished.
A definite drowsiness overcame us.  Since I saw no good reason
to resist the call of sleep, I fell into a heavy doze.
I dreamed&#8212;one doesn't choose his dreams&#8212;that my life had been
reduced to the vegetating existence of a simple mollusk.
It seemed to me that this cave made up my double-valved shell. . . .</p>

<p id="id02876">Suddenly Conseil's voice startled me awake.</p>

<p id="id02877">"Get up!  Get up!" shouted the fine lad.</p>

<p id="id02878">"What is it?"  I asked, in a sitting position.</p>

<p id="id02879">"The water's coming up to us!"</p>

<p id="id02880">I got back on my feet.  Like a torrent the sea was rushing
into our retreat, and since we definitely were not mollusks,
we had to clear out.</p>

<p id="id02881">In a few seconds we were safe on top of the cave.</p>

<p id="id02882">"What happened?"  Conseil asked.  "Some new phenomenon?"</p>

<p id="id02883">"Not quite, my friends!"  I replied.  "It was the tide,
merely the tide, which wellnigh caught us by surprise just as it
did Sir Walter Scott's hero!  The ocean outside is rising,
and by a perfectly natural law of balance, the level of this
lake is also rising.  We've gotten off with a mild dunking.
Let's go change clothes on the Nautilus."</p>

<p id="id02884">Three-quarters of an hour later, we had completed our circular stroll
and were back on board.  Just then the crewmen finished loading
the sodium supplies, and the Nautilus could have departed immediately.</p>

<p id="id02885">But Captain Nemo gave no orders.  Would he wait for nightfall
and exit through his underwater passageway in secrecy?  Perhaps.</p>

<p id="id02886">Be that as it may, by the next day the Nautilus had left its home
port and was navigating well out from any shore, a few meters
beneath the waves of the Atlantic.</p>

<h2 id="id02887">CHAPTER 11</h2>

<h6 id="id02888">The Sargasso Sea</h6>

<p id="id02889">THE NAUTILUS didn't change direction.  For the time being, then,<br/>

we had to set aside any hope of returning to European seas.<br/>

Captain Nemo kept his prow pointing south.  Where was he taking us?<br/>

I was afraid to guess.<br/></p>

<p id="id02890">That day the Nautilus crossed an odd part of the Atlantic Ocean.  No one
is unaware of the existence of that great warm-water current known
by name as the Gulf Stream.  After emerging from channels off Florida,
it heads toward Spitzbergen.  But before entering the Gulf of Mexico
near latitude 44 degrees north, this current divides into two arms;
its chief arm makes for the shores of Ireland and Norway
while the second flexes southward at the level of the Azores;
then it hits the coast of Africa, sweeps in a long oval, and returns
to the Caribbean Sea.</p>

<p id="id02891">Now then, this second arm&#8212;more accurately, a collar&#8212;forms a ring
of warm water around a section of cool, tranquil, motionless ocean
called the Sargasso Sea.  This is an actual lake in the open Atlantic,
and the great current's waters take at least three years to circle it.</p>

<p id="id02892">Properly speaking, the Sargasso Sea covers every submerged part
of Atlantis.  Certain authors have even held that the many weeds
strewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that
ancient continent.  But it's more likely that these grasses, algae,
and fucus plants were carried off from the beaches of Europe and America,
then taken as far as this zone by the Gulf Stream.  This is one
of the reasons why Christopher Columbus assumed the existence
of a New World.  When the ships of that bold investigator arrived
in the Sargasso Sea, they had great difficulty navigating in the midst
of these weeds, which, much to their crews' dismay, slowed them down
to a halt; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector.</p>

<p id="id02893">Such was the region our Nautilus was visiting just then:
a genuine prairie, a tightly woven carpet of algae, gulfweed,
and bladder wrack so dense and compact a craft's stempost couldn't
tear through it without difficulty.  Accordingly, not wanting
to entangle his propeller in this weed-choked mass, Captain Nemo
stayed at a depth some meters below the surface of the waves.</p>

<p id="id02894">The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word "sargazo,"
meaning gulfweed.  This gulfweed, the swimming gulfweed or
berry carrier, is the chief substance making up this immense shoal.
And here's why these water plants collect in this placid Atlantic basin,
according to the expert on the subject, Commander Maury, author of
The Physical Geography of the Sea.</p>

<p id="id02895">The explanation he gives seems to entail a set of conditions that
everybody knows:  "Now," Maury says, "if bits of cork or chaff,
or any floating substance, be put into a basin, and a circular motion
be given to the water, all the light substances will be found crowding
together near the center of the pool, where there is the least motion.
Just such a basin is the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf Stream,
and the Sargasso Sea is the center of the whirl."</p>

<p id="id02896">I share Maury's view, and I was able to study the phenomenon in this
exclusive setting where ships rarely go.  Above us, huddled among
the brown weeds, there floated objects originating from all over:
tree trunks ripped from the Rocky Mountains or the Andes and sent
floating down the Amazon or the Mississippi, numerous pieces
of wreckage, remnants of keels or undersides, bulwarks staved
in and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles, they couldn't
rise to the surface of the ocean.  And the passing years will someday
bear out Maury's other view that by collecting in this way over
the centuries, these substances will be turned to stone by the action
of the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields.
Valuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man
will have exhausted his mines on the continents.</p>

<p id="id02897">In the midst of this hopelessly tangled fabric of weeds and fucus plants,
I noted some delightful pink-colored, star-shaped alcyon coral,
sea anemone trailing the long tresses of their tentacles,
some green, red, and blue jellyfish, and especially those big
rhizostome jellyfish that Cuvier described, whose bluish parasols
are trimmed with violet festoons.</p>

<p id="id02898">We spent the whole day of February 22 in the Sargasso Sea, where fish
that dote on marine plants and crustaceans find plenty to eat.
The next day the ocean resumed its usual appearance.</p>

<p id="id02899">From this moment on, for nineteen days from February 23 to March 12,
the Nautilus stayed in the middle of the Atlantic, hustling us
along at a constant speed of 100 leagues every twenty-four hours.
It was obvious that Captain Nemo wanted to carry out his underwater
program, and I had no doubt that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn,
to return to the Pacific South Seas.</p>

<p id="id02900">So Ned Land had good reason to worry.  In these wide seas empty
of islands, it was no longer feasible to jump ship.  Nor did we
have any way to counter Captain Nemo's whims.  We had no choice
but to acquiesce; but if we couldn't attain our end through force
or cunning, I liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion.
Once this voyage was over, might not Captain Nemo consent to set
us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence?
Our word of honor, which we sincerely would have kept.
However, this delicate question would have to be negotiated with
the captain.  But how would he receive our demands for freedom?
At the very outset and in no uncertain terms, hadn't he declared
that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned
on board the Nautilus?  Wouldn't he see my four-month silence
as a tacit acceptance of this situation?  Would my returning to this
subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans,
if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on?
I weighed all these considerations, turned them over in my mind,
submitted them to Conseil, but he was as baffled as I was.
In short, although I'm not easily discouraged, I realized that my
chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day,
especially at a time when Captain Nemo was recklessly racing toward
the south Atlantic!</p>

<p id="id02901">During those nineteen days just mentioned, no unique incidents
distinguished our voyage.  I saw little of the captain.
He was at work.  In the library I often found books he had left open,
especially books on natural history.  He had thumbed through my work
on the great ocean depths, and the margins were covered with his notes,
which sometimes contradicted my theories and formulations.
But the captain remained content with this method of refining my work,
and he rarely discussed it with me.  Sometimes I heard melancholy
sounds reverberating from the organ, which he played very expressively,
but only at night in the midst of the most secretive darkness,
while the Nautilus slumbered in the wilderness of the ocean.</p>

<p id="id02902">During this part of our voyage, we navigated on the surface of the waves
for entire days.  The sea was nearly deserted.  A few sailing ships,
laden for the East Indies, were heading toward the Cape of
Good Hope.  One day we were chased by the longboats of a whaling vessel,
which undoubtedly viewed us as some enormous baleen whale of great value.
But Captain Nemo didn't want these gallant gentlemen wasting their
time and energy, so he ended the hunt by diving beneath the waters.
This incident seemed to fascinate Ned Land intensely.
I'm sure the Canadian was sorry that these fishermen couldn't
harpoon our sheet-iron cetacean and mortally wound it.</p>

<p id="id02903">During this period the fish Conseil and I observed differed little
from those we had already studied in other latitudes.  Chief among
them were specimens of that dreadful cartilaginous genus that's
divided into three subgenera numbering at least thirty-two species:
striped sharks five meters long, the head squat and wider than
the body, the caudal fin curved, the back with seven big, black,
parallel lines running lengthwise; then perlon sharks, ash gray,
pierced with seven gill openings, furnished with a single dorsal
fin placed almost exactly in the middle of the body.</p>

<p id="id02904">Some big dogfish also passed by, a voracious species of shark if there
ever was one.  With some justice, fishermen's yarns aren't to be trusted,
but here's what a few of them relate.  Inside the corpse of one
of these animals there were found a buffalo head and a whole calf;
in another, two tuna and a sailor in uniform; in yet another,
a soldier with his saber; in another, finally, a horse with its rider.
In candor, none of these sounds like divinely inspired truth.
But the fact remains that not a single dogfish let itself get caught
in the Nautilus's nets, so I can't vouch for their voracity.</p>

<p id="id02905">Schools of elegant, playful dolphin swam alongside for entire days.
They went in groups of five or six, hunting in packs like wolves
over the countryside; moreover, they're just as voracious as dogfish,
if I can believe a certain Copenhagen professor who says that from one
dolphin's stomach, he removed thirteen porpoises and fifteen seals.
True, it was a killer whale, belonging to the biggest known species,
whose length sometimes exceeds twenty-four feet.  The family
Delphinia numbers ten genera, and the dolphins I saw were akin
to the genus Delphinorhynchus, remarkable for an extremely narrow
muzzle four times as long as the cranium.  Measuring three meters,
their bodies were black on top, underneath a pinkish white strewn
with small, very scattered spots.</p>

<p id="id02906">From these seas I'll also mention some unusual specimens of croakers,
fish from the order Acanthopterygia, family Scienidea.  Some authors&#8212;
more artistic than scientific&#8212;claim that these fish are
melodious singers, that their voices in unison put on concerts
unmatched by human choristers.  I don't say nay, but to my regret
these croakers didn't serenade us as we passed.</p>

<p id="id02907">Finally, to conclude, Conseil classified a large number
of flying fish.  Nothing could have made a more unusual sight
than the marvelous timing with which dolphins hunt these fish.
Whatever the range of its flight, however evasive its trajectory
(even up and over the Nautilus), the hapless flying fish always found
a dolphin to welcome it with open mouth.  These were either flying
gurnards or kitelike sea robins, whose lips glowed in the dark,
at night scrawling fiery streaks in the air before plunging into
the murky waters like so many shooting stars.</p>

<p id="id02908">Our navigating continued under these conditions until March 13.
That day the Nautilus was put to work in some depth-sounding
experiments that fascinated me deeply.</p>

<p id="id02909">By then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point
in the Pacific high seas.  Our position fix placed us in latitude
45 degrees 37' south and longitude 37 degrees 53' west.  These were
the same waterways where Captain Denham, aboard the Herald,
payed out 14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom.
It was here too that Lieutenant Parker, aboard the American
frigate Congress, was unable to reach the underwater soil
at 15,149 meters.</p>

<p id="id02910">Captain Nemo decided to take his Nautilus down to the lowest
depths in order to double-check these different soundings.
I got ready to record the results of this experiment.
The panels in the lounge opened, and maneuvers began for reaching
those strata so prodigiously far removed.</p>

<p id="id02911">It was apparently considered out of the question to dive by filling
the ballast tanks.  Perhaps they wouldn't sufficiently increase
the Nautilus's specific gravity.  Moreover, in order to come back up,
it would be necessary to expel the excess water, and our pumps
might not have been strong enough to overcome the outside pressure.</p>

<p id="id02912">Captain Nemo decided to make for the ocean floor by submerging on
an appropriately gradual diagonal with the help of his side fins,
which were set at a 45 degrees angle to the Nautilus's waterline.
Then the propeller was brought to its maximum speed, and its four
blades churned the waves with indescribable violence.</p>

<p id="id02913">Under this powerful thrust the Nautilus's hull quivered like a
resonating chord, and the ship sank steadily under the waters.
Stationed in the lounge, the captain and I watched the needle
swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge.  Soon we had gone below
the livable zone where most fish reside.  Some of these animals
can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers, but a minority
can dwell at fairly great depths.  Among the latter I observed
a species of dogfish called the cow shark that's equipped with six
respiratory slits, the telescope fish with its enormous eyes,
the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral
fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone,
then finally the grenadier, living at a depth of 1,200 meters,
by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres.</p>

<p id="id02914">I asked Captain Nemo if he had observed any fish at
more considerable depths.</p>

<p id="id02915">"Fish?  Rarely!" he answered me.  "But given the current state
of marine science, who are we to presume, what do we really know
of these depths?"</p>

<p id="id02916">"Just this, captain.  In going toward the ocean's lower strata,
we know that vegetable life disappears more quickly than animal life.
We know that moving creatures can still be encountered where water
plants no longer grow.  We know that oysters and pilgrim scallops live
in 2,000 meters of water, and that Admiral McClintock, England's hero of
the polar seas, pulled in a live sea star from a depth of 2,500 meters.
We know that the crew of the Royal Navy's Bulldog fished up a starfish
from 2,620 fathoms, hence from a depth of more than one vertical league.
Would you still say, Captain Nemo, that we really know nothing?"</p>

<p id="id02917">"No, professor," the captain replied, "I wouldn't be so discourteous.<br/>

Yet I'll ask you to explain how these creatures can live at such depths?"<br/></p>

<p id="id02918">"I explain it on two grounds," I replied.  "In the first place,
because vertical currents, which are caused by differences in the
water's salinity and density, can produce enough motion to sustain
the rudimentary lifestyles of sea lilies and starfish."</p>

<p id="id02919">"True," the captain put in.</p>

<p id="id02920">"In the second place, because oxygen is the basis of life, and we
know that the amount of oxygen dissolved in salt water increases
rather than decreases with depth, that the pressure in these lower
strata helps to concentrate their oxygen content."</p>

<p id="id02921">"Oho!  We know that, do we?"  Captain Nemo replied in a tone
of mild surprise.  "Well, professor, we have good reason to know
it because it's the truth.  I might add, in fact, that the air
bladders of fish contain more nitrogen than oxygen when these animals
are caught at the surface of the water, and conversely, more oxygen
than nitrogen when they're pulled up from the lower depths.
Which bears out your formulation.  But let's continue our observations."</p>

<p id="id02922">My eyes flew back to the pressure gauge.  The instrument indicated
a depth of 6,000 meters.  Our submergence had been going on for an hour.
The Nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins, still sinking.
These deserted waters were wonderfully clear, with a transparency
impossible to convey.  An hour later we were at 13,000 meters&#8212;
about three and a quarter vertical leagues&#8212;and the ocean floor
was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p id="id02923">However, at 14,000 meters I saw blackish peaks rising in the midst
of the waters.  But these summits could have belonged to mountains
as high or even higher than the Himalayas or Mt.  Blanc, and the extent
of these depths remained incalculable.</p>

<p id="id02924">Despite the powerful pressures it was undergoing, the Nautilus sank
still deeper.  I could feel its sheet-iron plates trembling down to
their riveted joins; metal bars arched; bulkheads groaned; the lounge
windows seemed to be warping inward under the water's pressure.
And this whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way, if, as its
captain had said, it weren't capable of resisting like a solid block.</p>

<p id="id02925">While grazing these rocky slopes lost under the waters, I still
spotted some seashells, tube worms, lively annelid worms from
the genus Spirorbis, and certain starfish specimens.</p>

<p id="id02926">But soon these last representatives of animal life vanished,
and three vertical leagues down, the Nautilus passed below the limits
of underwater existence just as an air balloon rises above the
breathable zones in the sky.  We reached a depth of 16,000 meters&#8212;
four vertical leagues&#8212;and by then the Nautilus's plating was
tolerating a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, in other words,
1,600 kilograms per each square centimeter on its surface!</p>

<p id="id02927">"What an experience!"  I exclaimed.  "Traveling these deep
regions where no man has ever ventured before!  Look, captain!
Look at these magnificent rocks, these uninhabited caves,
these last global haunts where life is no longer possible!
What unheard-of scenery, and why are we reduced to preserving it
only as a memory?"</p>

<p id="id02928">"Would you like," Captain Nemo asked me, "to bring back more than
just a memory?"</p>

<p id="id02929">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p id="id02930">"I mean that nothing could be easier than taking a photograph
of this underwater region!"</p>

<p id="id02931">Before I had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me,
a camera was carried into the lounge at Captain Nemo's request.
The liquid setting, electrically lit, unfolded with perfect
clarity through the wide-open panels.  No shadows, no blurs,
thanks to our artificial light.  Not even sunshine could have
been better for our purposes.  With the thrust of its propeller
curbed by the slant of its fins, the Nautilus stood still.
The camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor, and in a few
seconds we had a perfect negative.</p>

<p id="id02932">I attach a print of the positive.  In it you can view these primordial
rocks that have never seen the light of day, this nether granite
that forms the powerful foundation of our globe, the deep caves
cut into the stony mass, the outlines of incomparable distinctness
whose far edges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain
Flemish painters.  In the distance is a mountainous horizon, a wondrously
undulating line that makes up the background of this landscape.
The general effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable:
black, polished, without moss or other blemish, carved into
strange shapes, sitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled
beneath our streams of electric light.</p>

<p id="id02933">Meanwhile, his photographic operations over, Captain Nemo told me:</p>

<p id="id02934">"Let's go back up, professor.  We mustn't push our luck and expose
the Nautilus too long to these pressures."</p>

<p id="id02935">"Let's go back up!"  I replied.</p>

<p id="id02936">"Hold on tight."</p>

<p id="id02937">Before I had time to realize why the captain made this recommendation,<br/>

I was hurled to the carpet.<br/></p>

<p id="id02938">Its fins set vertically, its propeller thrown in gear at
the captain's signal, the Nautilus rose with lightning speed,
shooting upward like an air balloon into the sky.  Vibrating resonantly,
it knifed through the watery mass.  Not a single detail was visible.
In four minutes it had cleared the four vertical leagues separating it
from the surface of the ocean, and after emerging like a flying fish,
it fell back into the sea, making the waves leap to prodigious heights.</p>

<h2 id="id02939">CHAPTER 12</h2>

<h6 id="id02940">Sperm Whales and Baleen Whales</h6>

<p id="id02941">DURING THE NIGHT of March 13-14, the Nautilus resumed its
southward heading.  Once it was abreast of Cape Horn, I thought it
would strike west of the cape, make for Pacific seas, and complete
its tour of the world.  It did nothing of the sort and kept moving
toward the southernmost regions.  So where was it bound?  The pole?
That was insanity.  I was beginning to think that the captain's
recklessness more than justified Ned Land's worst fears.</p>

<p id="id02942">For a good while the Canadian had said nothing more to me about
his escape plans.  He had become less sociable, almost sullen.
I could see how heavily this protracted imprisonment was weighing on him.
I could feel the anger building in him.  Whenever he encountered
the captain, his eyes would flicker with dark fire, and I was
in constant dread that his natural vehemence would cause him
to do something rash.</p>

<p id="id02943">That day, March 14, he and Conseil managed to find me in my stateroom.<br/>

I asked them the purpose of their visit.<br/></p>

<p id="id02944">"To put a simple question to you, sir," the Canadian answered me.</p>

<p id="id02945">"Go on, Ned."</p>

<p id="id02946">"How many men do you think are on board the Nautilus?"</p>

<p id="id02947">"I'm unable to say, my friend."</p>

<p id="id02948">"It seems to me," Ned Land went on, "that it wouldn't take much
of a crew to run a ship like this one."</p>

<p id="id02949">"Correct," I replied.  "Under existing conditions some ten men
at the most should be enough to operate it."</p>

<p id="id02950">"All right," the Canadian said, "then why should there be any
more than that?"</p>

<p id="id02951">"Why?"  I answered.</p>

<p id="id02952">I stared at Ned Land, whose motives were easy to guess.</p>

<p id="id02953">"Because," I said, "if I can trust my hunches, if I truly understand
the captain's way of life, his Nautilus isn't simply a ship.
It's meant to be a refuge for people like its commander, people who
have severed all ties with the shore."</p>

<p id="id02954">"Perhaps," Conseil said, "but in a nutshell, the Nautilus can hold only
a certain number of men, so couldn't master estimate their maximum?"</p>

<p id="id02955">"How, Conseil?"</p>

<p id="id02956">"By calculating it.  Master is familiar with the ship's capacity,
hence the amount of air it contains; on the other hand,
master knows how much air each man consumes in the act of breathing,
and he can compare this data with the fact that the Nautilus must
rise to the surface every twenty-four hours . . ."</p>

<p id="id02957">Conseil didn't finish his sentence, but I could easily see what
he was driving at.</p>

<p id="id02958">"I follow you," I said.  "But while they're simple to do,
such calculations can give only a very uncertain figure."</p>

<p id="id02959">"No problem," the Canadian went on insistently.</p>

<p id="id02960">"Then here's how to calculate it," I replied.  "In one hour
each man consumes the oxygen contained in 100 liters of air,
hence during twenty-four hours the oxygen contained in 2,400 liters.
Therefore, we must look for the multiple of 2,400 liters of air
that gives us the amount found in the Nautilus."</p>

<p id="id02961">"Precisely," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id02962">"Now then," I went on, "the Nautilus's capacity is 1,500 metric tons,
and that of a ton is 1,000 liters, so the Nautilus holds 1,500,000
liters of air, which, divided by 2,400 . . ."</p>

<p id="id02963">I did a quick pencil calculation.</p>

<p id="id02964">". . . gives us the quotient of 625.  Which is tantamount to saying
that the air contained in the Nautilus would be exactly enough
for 625 men over twenty-four hours."</p>

<p id="id02965">"625!"  Ned repeated.</p>

<p id="id02966">"But rest assured," I added, "that between passengers, seamen,
or officers, we don't total one-tenth of that figure."</p>

<p id="id02967">"Which is still too many for three men!"  Conseil muttered.</p>

<p id="id02968">"So, my poor Ned, I can only counsel patience."</p>

<p id="id02969">"And," Conseil replied, "even more than patience, resignation."</p>

<p id="id02970">Conseil had said the true word.</p>

<p id="id02971">"Even so," he went on, "Captain Nemo can't go south forever!<br/>

He'll surely have to stop, if only at the Ice Bank, and he'll<br/>

return to the seas of civilization!  Then it will be time to resume<br/>

Ned Land's plans."<br/></p>

<p id="id02972">The Canadian shook his head, passed his hand over his brow,
made no reply, and left us.</p>

<p id="id02973">"With master's permission, I'll make an observation to him,"
Conseil then told me.  "Our poor Ned broods about all
the things he can't have.  He's haunted by his former life.
He seems to miss everything that's denied us.  He's obsessed by his
old memories and it's breaking his heart.  We must understand him.
What does he have to occupy him here?  Nothing.  He isn't a scientist
like master, and he doesn't share our enthusiasm for the sea's wonders.
He would risk anything just to enter a tavern in his own country!"</p>

<p id="id02974">To be sure, the monotony of life on board must have seemed unbearable
to the Canadian, who was accustomed to freedom and activity.
It was a rare event that could excite him.  That day, however,
a development occurred that reminded him of his happy years
as a harpooner.</p>

<p id="id02975">Near eleven o'clock in the morning, while on the surface of
the ocean, the Nautilus fell in with a herd of baleen whales.
This encounter didn't surprise me, because I knew these animals
were being hunted so relentlessly that they took refuge in the ocean
basins of the high latitudes.</p>

<p id="id02976">In the maritime world and in the realm of geographic exploration,
whales have played a major role.  This is the animal that first
dragged the Basques in its wake, then Asturian Spaniards, Englishmen,
and Dutchmen, emboldening them against the ocean's perils,
and leading them to the ends of the earth.  Baleen whales like
to frequent the southernmost and northernmost seas.  Old legends
even claim that these cetaceans led fishermen to within a mere
seven leagues of the North Pole.  Although this feat is fictitious,
it will someday come true, because it's likely that by hunting
whales in the Arctic or Antarctic regions, man will finally reach
this unknown spot on the globe.</p>

<p id="id02977">We were seated on the platform next to a tranquil sea.  The month
of March, since it's the equivalent of October in these latitudes,
was giving us some fine autumn days.  It was the Canadian&#8212;
on this topic he was never mistaken&#8212;who sighted a baleen whale
on the eastern horizon.  If you looked carefully, you could see
its blackish back alternately rise and fall above the waves,
five miles from the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id02978">"Wow!"  Ned Land exclaimed.  "If I were on board a whaler,<br/>

there's an encounter that would be great fun!  That's one big animal!<br/>

Look how high its blowholes are spouting all that air and steam!<br/>

Damnation!  Why am I chained to this hunk of sheet iron!"<br/></p>

<p id="id02979">"Why, Ned!"  I replied.  "You still aren't over your old fishing urges?"</p>

<p id="id02980">"How could a whale fisherman forget his old trade, sir?  Who could
ever get tired of such exciting hunting?"</p>

<p id="id02981">"You've never fished these seas, Ned?"</p>

<p id="id02982">"Never, sir.  Just the northernmost seas, equally in the Bering Strait
and the Davis Strait."</p>

<p id="id02983">"So the southern right whale is still unknown to you.
Until now it's the bowhead whale you've hunted, and it won't risk
going past the warm waters of the equator."</p>

<p id="id02984">"Oh, professor, what are you feeding me?" the Canadian answered
in a tolerably skeptical tone.</p>

<p id="id02985">"I'm feeding you the facts."</p>

<p id="id02986">"By thunder!  In '65, just two and a half years ago, I to whom you speak,
I myself stepped onto the carcass of a whale near Greenland,
and its flank still carried the marked harpoon of a whaling ship
from the Bering Sea.  Now I ask you, after it had been wounded
west of America, how could this animal be killed in the east,
unless it had cleared the equator and doubled Cape Horn or the Cape
of Good Hope?"</p>

<p id="id02987">"I agree with our friend Ned," Conseil said, "and I'm waiting
to hear how master will reply to him."</p>

<p id="id02988">"Master will reply, my friends, that baleen whales are localized,
according to species, within certain seas that they never leave.
And if one of these animals went from the Bering Strait
to the Davis Strait, it's quite simply because there's some
passageway from the one sea to the other, either along the coasts
of Canada or Siberia."</p>

<p id="id02989">"You expect us to fall for that?" the Canadian asked, tipping me a wink.</p>

<p id="id02990">"If master says so," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id02991">"Which means," the Canadian went on, "since I've never fished
these waterways, I don't know the whales that frequent them?"</p>

<p id="id02992">"That's what I've been telling you, Ned."</p>

<p id="id02993">"All the more reason to get to know them," Conseil answered.</p>

<p id="id02994">"Look!  Look!" the Canadian exclaimed, his voice full of excitement.<br/>

"It's approaching!  It's coming toward us!  It's thumbing its nose at me!<br/>

It knows I can't do a blessed thing to it!"<br/></p>

<p id="id02995">Ned stamped his foot.  Brandishing an imaginary harpoon,
his hands positively trembled.</p>

<p id="id02996">"These cetaceans," he asked, "are they as big as the ones in
the northernmost seas?"</p>

<p id="id02997">"Pretty nearly, Ned."</p>

<p id="id02998">"Because I've seen big baleen whales, sir, whales measuring up
to 100 feet long!  I've even heard that those rorqual whales off
the Aleutian Islands sometimes get over 150 feet."</p>

<p id="id02999">"That strikes me as exaggerated," I replied.  "Those animals are
only members of the genus Balaenoptera furnished with dorsal fins,
and like sperm whales, they're generally smaller than the bowhead whale."</p>

<p id="id03000">"Oh!" exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes hadn't left the ocean.<br/>

"It's getting closer, it's coming into the Nautilus's waters!"<br/></p>

<p id="id03001">Then, going on with his conversation:</p>

<p id="id03002">"You talk about sperm whales," he said, "as if they were
little beasts!  But there are stories of gigantic sperm whales.
They're shrewd cetaceans.  I hear that some will cover themselves
with algae and fucus plants.  People mistake them for islets.
They pitch camp on top, make themselves at home, light a fire&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id03003">"Build houses," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id03004">"Yes, funny man," Ned Land replied.  "Then one fine day the animal
dives and drags all its occupants down into the depths."</p>

<p id="id03005">"Like in the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor," I answered, laughing.
"Oh, Mr. Land, you're addicted to tall tales!  What sperm whales
you're handing us!  I hope you don't really believe in them!"</p>

<p id="id03006">"Mr. Naturalist," the Canadian replied in all seriousness, "when it
comes to whales, you can believe anything!  (Look at that one move!
Look at it stealing away!) People claim these animals can circle
around the world in just fifteen days."</p>

<p id="id03007">"I don't say nay."</p>

<p id="id03008">"But what you undoubtedly don't know, Professor Aronnax, is that at
the beginning of the world, whales traveled even quicker."</p>

<p id="id03009">"Oh really, Ned!  And why so?"</p>

<p id="id03010">"Because in those days their tails moved side to side,
like those on fish, in other words, their tails were straight up,
thrashing the water from left to right, right to left.
But spotting that they swam too fast, our Creator twisted their tails,
and ever since they've been thrashing the waves up and down,
at the expense of their speed."</p>

<p id="id03011">"Fine, Ned," I said, then resurrected one of the Canadian's expressions.<br/>

"You expect us to fall for that?"<br/></p>

<p id="id03012">"Not too terribly," Ned Land replied, "and no more than if I told you
there are whales that are 300 feet long and weigh 1,000,000 pounds."</p>

<p id="id03013">"That's indeed considerable," I said.  "But you must admit that
certain cetaceans do grow to significant size, since they're said
to supply as much as 120 metric tons of oil."</p>

<p id="id03014">"That I've seen," the Canadian said.</p>

<p id="id03015">"I can easily believe it, Ned, just as I can believe that certain
baleen whales equal 100 elephants in bulk.  Imagine the impact
of such a mass if it were launched at full speed!"</p>

<p id="id03016">"Is it true," Conseil asked, "that they can sink ships?"</p>

<p id="id03017">"Ships?  I doubt it," I replied.  "However, they say that in 1820,
right in these southern seas, a baleen whale rushed at the Essex
and pushed it backward at a speed of four meters per second.
Its stern was flooded, and the Essex went down fast."</p>

<p id="id03018">Ned looked at me with a bantering expression.</p>

<p id="id03019">"Speaking for myself," he said, "I once got walloped by a whale's tail&#8212;
in my longboat, needless to say.  My companions and I were launched
to an altitude of six meters.  But next to the professor's whale,
mine was just a baby."</p>

<p id="id03020">"Do these animals live a long time?"  Conseil asked.</p>

<p id="id03021">"A thousand years," the Canadian replied without hesitation.</p>

<p id="id03022">"And how, Ned," I asked, "do you know that's so?"</p>

<p id="id03023">"Because people say so."</p>

<p id="id03024">"And why do people say so?"</p>

<p id="id03025">"Because people know so."</p>

<p id="id03026">"No, Ned!  People don't know so, they suppose so, and here's the logic
with which they back up their beliefs.  When fishermen first hunted whales
400 years ago, these animals grew to bigger sizes than they do today.
Reasonably enough, it's assumed that today's whales are smaller
because they haven't had time to reach their full growth.
That's why the Count de Buffon's encyclopedia says that cetaceans
can live, and even must live, for a thousand years.  You understand?"</p>

<p id="id03027">Ned Land didn't understand.  He no longer even heard me.<br/>

That baleen whale kept coming closer.  His eyes devoured it.<br/></p>

<p id="id03028">"Oh!" he exclaimed.  "It's not just one whale, it's ten, twenty,
a whole gam!  And I can't do a thing!  I'm tied hand and foot!"</p>

<p id="id03029">"But Ned my friend," Conseil said, "why not ask Captain Nemo
for permission to hunt&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id03030">Before Conseil could finish his sentence, Ned Land scooted down
the hatch and ran to look for the captain.  A few moments later,
the two of them reappeared on the platform.</p>

<p id="id03031">Captain Nemo observed the herd of cetaceans cavorting on the waters
a mile from the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id03032">"They're southern right whales," he said.  "There goes the fortune
of a whole whaling fleet."</p>

<p id="id03033">"Well, sir," the Canadian asked, "couldn't I hunt them, just so I
don't forget my old harpooning trade?"</p>

<p id="id03034">"Hunt them?  What for?"  Captain Nemo replied.  "Simply to destroy them?<br/>

We have no use for whale oil on this ship."<br/></p>

<p id="id03035">"But, sir," the Canadian went on, "in the Red Sea you authorized
us to chase a dugong!"</p>

<p id="id03036">"There it was an issue of obtaining fresh meat for my crew.
Here it would be killing for the sake of killing.  I'm well aware
that's a privilege reserved for mankind, but I don't allow such
murderous pastimes.  When your peers, Mr. Land, destroy decent,
harmless creatures like the southern right whale or the bowhead whale,
they commit a reprehensible offense.  Thus they've already depopulated
all of Baffin Bay, and they'll wipe out a whole class of useful animals.
So leave these poor cetaceans alone.  They have quite enough
natural enemies, such as sperm whales, swordfish, and sawfish,
without you meddling with them."</p>

<p id="id03037">I'll let the reader decide what faces the Canadian made during this
lecture on hunting ethics.  Furnishing such arguments to a professional
harpooner was a waste of words.  Ned Land stared at Captain Nemo
and obviously missed his meaning.  But the captain was right.
Thanks to the mindless, barbaric bloodthirstiness of fishermen,
the last baleen whale will someday disappear from the ocean.</p>

<p id="id03038">Ned Land whistled "Yankee Doodle" between his teeth, stuffed his
hands in his pockets, and turned his back on us.</p>

<p id="id03039">Meanwhile Captain Nemo studied the herd of cetaceans, then addressed me:</p>

<p id="id03040">"I was right to claim that baleen whales have enough natural enemies
without counting man.  These specimens will soon have to deal
with mighty opponents.  Eight miles to leeward, Professor Aronnax,
can you see those blackish specks moving about?"</p>

<p id="id03041">"Yes, captain," I replied.</p>

<p id="id03042">"Those are sperm whales, dreadful animals that I've sometimes
encountered in herds of 200 or 300!  As for them, they're cruel,
destructive beasts, and they deserve to be exterminated."</p>

<p id="id03043">The Canadian turned swiftly at these last words.</p>

<p id="id03044">"Well, captain," I said, "on behalf of the baleen whales,
there's still time&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id03045">"It's pointless to run any risks, professor.  The Nautilus will
suffice to disperse these sperm whales.  It's armed with a steel
spur quite equal to Mr. Land's harpoon, I imagine."</p>

<p id="id03046">The Canadian didn't even bother shrugging his shoulders.
Attacking cetaceans with thrusts from a spur!  Who ever heard
of such malarkey!</p>

<p id="id03047">"Wait and see, Professor Aronnax," Captain Nemo said.<br/>

"We'll show you a style of hunting with which you aren't yet familiar.<br/>

We'll take no pity on these ferocious cetaceans.  They're merely<br/>

mouth and teeth!"<br/></p>

<p id="id03048">Mouth and teeth!  There's no better way to describe the long-skulled
sperm whale, whose length sometimes exceeds twenty-five meters.
The enormous head of this cetacean occupies about a third of its body.
Better armed than a baleen whale, whose upper jaw is adorned solely
with whalebone, the sperm whale is equipped with twenty-five
huge teeth that are twenty centimeters high, have cylindrical,
conical summits, and weigh two pounds each.  In the top part of this
enormous head, inside big cavities separated by cartilage, you'll find
300 to 400 kilograms of that valuable oil called "spermaceti."
The sperm whale is an awkward animal, more tadpole than fish,
as Professor Fr&#233;dol has noted.  It's poorly constructed,
being "defective," so to speak, over the whole left side of its frame,
with good eyesight only in its right eye.</p>

<p id="id03049">Meanwhile that monstrous herd kept coming closer.
It had seen the baleen whales and was preparing to attack.
You could tell in advance that the sperm whales would be victorious,
not only because they were better built for fighting than their
harmless adversaries, but also because they could stay longer
underwater before returning to breathe at the surface.</p>

<p id="id03050">There was just time to run to the rescue of the baleen whales.
The Nautilus proceeded to midwater.  Conseil, Ned, and I sat in front
of the lounge windows.  Captain Nemo made his way to the helmsman's
side to operate his submersible as an engine of destruction.
Soon I felt the beats of our propeller getting faster, and we
picked up speed.</p>

<p id="id03051">The battle between sperm whales and baleen whales had already begun
when the Nautilus arrived.  It maneuvered to cut into the herd
of long-skulled predators.  At first the latter showed little
concern at the sight of this new monster meddling in the battle.
But they soon had to sidestep its thrusts.</p>

<p id="id03052">What a struggle!  Ned Land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended
up applauding.  Brandished in its captain's hands, the Nautilus was
simply a fearsome harpoon.  He hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran
them clean through, leaving behind two squirming animal halves.
As for those daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides,
the ship never felt them.  No more than the collisions it caused.
One sperm whale exterminated, it ran at another, tacked on the spot
so as not to miss its prey, went ahead or astern, obeyed its rudder,
dived when the cetacean sank to deeper strata, rose with it
when it returned to the surface, struck it head-on or slantwise,
hacked at it or tore it, and from every direction and at any speed,
skewered it with its dreadful spur.</p>

<p id="id03053">What bloodshed!  What a hubbub on the surface of the waves!<br/>

What sharp hisses and snorts unique to these frightened animals!<br/>

Their tails churned the normally peaceful strata into actual billows.<br/></p>

<p id="id03054">This Homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour, and the long-skulled
predators couldn't get away.  Several times ten or twelve of them
teamed up, trying to crush the Nautilus with their sheer mass.
Through the windows you could see their enormous mouths paved
with teeth, their fearsome eyes.  Losing all self-control, Ned Land
hurled threats and insults at them.  You could feel them clinging
to the submersible like hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush.
But by forcing the pace of its propeller, the Nautilus carried them off,
dragged them under, or brought them back to the upper level of the waters,
untroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip.</p>

<p id="id03055">Finally this mass of sperm whales thinned out.  The waves grew
tranquil again.  I felt us rising to the surface of the ocean.
The hatch opened and we rushed onto the platform.</p>

<p id="id03056">The sea was covered with mutilated corpses.  A fearsome explosion
couldn't have slashed, torn, or shredded these fleshy masses with
greater violence.  We were floating in the midst of gigantic bodies,
bluish on the back, whitish on the belly, and all deformed
by enormous protuberances.  A few frightened sperm whales were
fleeing toward the horizon.  The waves were dyed red over an area
of several miles, and the Nautilus was floating in the middle
of a sea of blood.</p>

<p id="id03057">Captain Nemo rejoined us.</p>

<p id="id03058">"Well, Mr. Land?" he said.</p>

<p id="id03059">"Well, sir," replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had subsided,
"it's a dreadful sight for sure.  But I'm a hunter not a butcher,
and this is plain butchery."</p>

<p id="id03060">"It was a slaughter of destructive animals," the captain replied,
"and the Nautilus is no butcher knife."</p>

<p id="id03061">"I prefer my harpoon," the Canadian answered.</p>

<p id="id03062">"To each his own," the captain replied, staring intently at Ned Land.</p>

<p id="id03063">I was in dread the latter would give way to some violent outburst
that might have had deplorable consequences.  But his anger was
diverted by the sight of a baleen whale that the Nautilus had pulled
alongside of just then.</p>

<p id="id03064">This animal had been unable to escape the teeth of those sperm whales.
I recognized the southern right whale, its head squat, its body dark
all over.  Anatomically, it's distinguished from the white whale and
the black right whale by the fusion of its seven cervical vertebrae,
and it numbers two more ribs than its relatives.  Floating on its side,
its belly riddled with bites, the poor cetacean was dead.
Still hanging from the tip of its mutilated fin was a little baby
whale that it had been unable to rescue from the slaughter.
Its open mouth let water flow through its whalebone like a murmuring surf.</p>

<p id="id03065">Captain Nemo guided the Nautilus next to the animal's corpse.<br/>

Two of his men climbed onto the whale's flank, and to my astonishment,<br/>

I saw them draw from its udders all the milk they held, in other words,<br/>

enough to fill two or three casks.<br/></p>

<p id="id03066">The captain offered me a cup of this still-warm milk.<br/>

I couldn't help showing my distaste for such a beverage.<br/>

He assured me that this milk was excellent, no different from cow's milk.<br/></p>

<p id="id03067">I sampled it and agreed.  So this milk was a worthwhile reserve
ration for us, because in the form of salt butter or cheese,
it would provide a pleasant change of pace from our standard fare.</p>

<p id="id03068">From that day on, I noted with some uneasiness that Ned Land's
attitudes toward Captain Nemo grew worse and worse, and I decided
to keep a close watch on the Canadian's movements and activities.</p>
