<h2 id="id03572" style="margin-top: 4em">THE STORY OF THE ENCHANTED HORSE.</h2>

<p id="id03573" style="margin-top: 3em">The Nooroze, or the new day, which is the first of the year and
spring, is observed as a solemn festival throughout all Persia,
which has been continued from the time of idolatry; and our
prophet's religion, pure as it is, and true as we hold it, has
not been able to abolish that heathenish custom, and the
superstitious ceremonies which are observed, not only in the
great cities, but celebrated with extraordinary rejoicings in
every little town, village, and hamlet.</p>

<p id="id03574">But the rejoicings are the most splendid at the court, for the
variety of new and surprising spectacles, insomuch that strangers
are invited from the neighbouring states, and the most remote
parts, by the rewards and liberality of the sovereign, towards
those who are the most excellent in their invention and
contrivance. In short, nothing in the rest of the world can
compare with the magnificence of this festival.</p>

<p id="id03575">One of these festival days, after the most ingenious artists of
the country had repaired to Sheerauz, where the court then
resided, had entertained the king and all the court with their
productions, and had been bountifully and liberally rewarded
according to their merit and to their satisfaction by the
monarch; when the assembly was just breaking up, a Hindoo
appeared at the foot of the throne, with an artificial horse
richly caparisoned, and so naturally imitated, that at first
sight he was taken for a living animal.</p>

<p id="id03576">The Hindoo prostrated himself before the throne; and pointing to the
horse, said to the emperor, "Though I present myself the last before
your majesty, yet I can assure you that nothing shewn to-day is so
wonderful as this horse, on which I beg your majesty would be pleased
to cast your eyes." "I see nothing more in the horse," said the
emperor, "than the natural resemblance the workman has given him;
which the skill of another workman may possibly execute as well or
better."</p>

<p id="id03577">"Sir," replied the Hindoo, "it is not for his outward form and
appearance that I recommend my horse to your majesty's
examination as wonderful, but the use to which I can apply him,
and which, when I have communicated the secret to them, any other
persons may make of him. Whenever I mount him, be it where it
may, if I wish to transport myself through the air to the most
distant part of the world, I can do it in a very short time.
This, sir, is the wonder of my horse; a wonder which nobody ever
heard speak of, and which I offer to shew your majesty, if you
command me."</p>

<p id="id03578">The emperor of Persia, who was fond of every thing that was
curious, and notwithstanding the many prodigies of art he had
seen had never beheld or heard of anything that came up to this,
told the Hindoo, that nothing but the experience of what he
asserted could convince him: and that he was ready to see him
perform what he had promised.</p>

<p id="id03579">The Hindoo instantly put his foot into the stirrup, mounted his
horse with admirable agility, and when he had fixed himself in
the saddle, asked the emperor whither he pleased to command him.</p>

<p id="id03580">About three leagues from Sheerauz there was a lofty mountain
discernible from the large square before the palace, where the
emperor, his court, and a great concourse of people, then were.
"Do you see that mountain?" said the emperor, pointing to it; "it
is not a great distance from hence, but it is far enough to judge
of the speed you can make in going and returning. But because it
is not possible for the eye to follow you so far, as a proof that
you have been there, I expect that you will bring me a branch of
a palm-tree that grows at the bottom of the hill."</p>

<p id="id03581">The emperor of Persia had no sooner declared his will than the
Hindoo turned a peg, which was in the hollow of the horse's neck,
just by the pummel of the saddle; and in an instant the horse
rose off the ground and carried his rider into the air with the
rapidity of lightning to such a height, that those who had the
strongest sight could not discern him, to the admiration of the
emperor and all the spectators. Within less than a quarter of an
hour they saw him returning with the palm branch in his hand; but
before he descended, he took two or three turns in the air over
the spot, amid the acclamations of all the people; then alighted
on the spot whence he had set off, without receiving the least
shock from the horse to disorder him. He dismounted, and going up
to the throne, prostrated himself, and laid the branch of the
palm-tree at the feet of the emperor.</p>

<p id="id03582">The emperor, who had viewed with no less admiration than
astonishment this unheard-of sight which the Hindoo had
exhibited, conceived a great desire to have the horse; and as he
persuaded himself that he should not find it a difficult matter
to treat with the Hindoo, for whatever sum of money he should
value it at, began to regard it as the most valuable thing in his
treasury. "Judging of thy horse by his outward appearance," said
he to the Hindoo, "I did not think him so much worth my
consideration. As you have shewn me his merits, I am obliged to
you for undeceiving me; and to prove to you how much I esteem it,
I will purchase him of you, if he is to be sold."</p>

<p id="id03583">"Sir," replied the Hindoo, "I never doubted that your majesty,
who has the character of the most liberal prince on earth, would
set a just value on my work as soon as I had shewn you on what
account he was worthy your attention. I also foresaw that you
would not only admire and commend it, but would desire to have
it. Though I know his intrinsic value, and that my continuing
master of him would render my name immortal in the world; yet I
am not so fond of fame but I can resign him, to gratify your
majesty; however, in making this declaration, I have another to
add, without which I cannot resolve to part with him, and perhaps
you may not approve of it.</p>

<p id="id03584">"Your majesty will not be displeased," continued the Hindoo, "if
I tell you that I did not buy this horse, but obtained him of the
inventor, by giving him my only daughter in marriage, and
promising at the same time never to sell him; but if I parted
with him to exchange him for something that I should value beyond
all else."</p>

<p id="id03585">The Hindoo was proceeding, when at the word exchange, the emperor
of Persia interrupted him. "I am willing," said he, "to give you
whatever you may ask in exchange. You know my kingdom is large,
and contains many great, rich, and populous cities; I will give
you the choice of which you like best, in full sovereignty for
life."</p>

<p id="id03586">This exchange seemed royal and noble to the whole court; but was
much below what the Hindoo had proposed to himself, who had
raised his thoughts much higher. "I am infinitely obliged to your
majesty for the offer you make me," answered he, "and cannot
thank you enough for your generosity; yet I must beg of you not
to be displeased if I have the presumption to tell you, that I
cannot resign my horse, but by receiving the hand of the princess
your daughter as my wife: this is the only price at which I can
part with my property."</p>

<p id="id03587">The courtiers about the emperor of Persia could not forbear
laughing aloud at this extravagant demand of the Hindoo; but the
prince Firoze Shaw, the eldest son of the emperor, and
presumptive heir to the crown, could not hear it without
indignation. The emperor was of a very different opinion, and
thought he might sacrifice the princess of Persia to the Hindoo,
to satisfy his curiosity. He remained however undetermined,
considering what he should do.</p>

<p id="id03588">Prince Firoze Shaw, who saw his father hesitated what answer to
make, began to fear lest he should comply with the Hindoo's
demand, and regarded it as not only injurious to the royal
dignity, and to his sister, but also to himself; therefore to
anticipate his father, he said, "Sir, I hope your majesty will
forgive me for daring to ask, if it is possible your majesty
should hesitate about a denial to so insolent a demand from such
an insignificant fellow, and so scandalous a juggler? or give him
reason to flatter himself a moment with being allied to one of
the most powerful monarchs in the world? I beg of you to consider
what you owe to yourself, to your own blood, and the high rank of
your ancestors."</p>

<p id="id03589">"Son," replied the emperor of Persia, "I much approve of your
remonstrance, and am sensible of your zeal for preserving the
lustre of your birth; but you do not consider sufficiently the
excellence of this horse; nor that the Hindoo, if I should refuse
him, may make the offer somewhere else, where this nice point of
honour may be waived. I shall be in the utmost despair if another
prince should boast of having exceeded me in generosity, and
deprived me of the glory of possessing what I esteem as the most
singular and wonderful thing in the world. I will not say I
consent to grant him what he asked. Perhaps he has not well
considered his exorbitant demand: and putting my daughter the
princess out of the question, I may make another agreement with
him that will answer his purpose as well. But before I conclude
the bargain with him, I should be glad that you would examine the
horse, try him yourself, and give me your opinion."</p>

<p id="id03590">As it is natural for us to flatter ourselves in what we desire,
the Hindoo fancied, from what he had heard, that the emperor was
not entirely averse to his alliance, and that the prince might
become more favourable to him; therefore, he expressed much joy,
ran before the prince to help him to mount, and shewed him how to
guide and manage the horse.</p>

<p id="id03591">The prince mounted without the Hindoo's assisting him; and no
sooner had he got his feet in both stirrups, but without staying
for the artist's advice, he turned the peg he had seen him use,
when instantly the horse darted into the air, quick as an arrow
shot out of a bow by the most adroit archer; and in a few moments
the emperor his father and the numerous assembly lost sight of
him. Neither horse nor prince were to be seen. The Hindoo,
alarmed at what had happened, prostrated himself before the
throne, and said, "Your majesty must have remarked the prince was
so hasty, that he would not permit me to give him the necessary
instructions to govern my horse. From what he saw me do, he was
ambitious of shewing that he wanted not my advice. He was too
eager to shew his address, but knows not the way, which I was
going to shew him, to turn the horse, and make him descend at the
wish of his rider. Therefore, the favour I ask of your majesty
is, not to make me accountable for what accidents may befall him;
you are too just to impute to me any misfortune that may attend
him."</p>

<p id="id03592">This address of the Hindoo much surprised and afflicted the
emperor, who saw the danger his son was in to be inevitable, if,
as the Hindoo said, there was a secret to bring him back,
different from that which carried him away; and asked, in a
passion, why he did not call him the moment he ascended?</p>

<p id="id03593">"Sir," answered the Hindoo, "your majesty saw as well as I with
what rapidity the horse flew away. The surprise I was then, and
still am in, deprived me of the use of my speech; but if I could
have spoken, he was got too far to hear me. If he had heard me,
he knew not the secret to bring him back, which, through his
impatience, he would not stay to learn. But, sir," added he,
"there is room to hope that the prince, when he finds himself at
a loss, will perceive another peg, and as soon as he turns that,
the horse will cease to rise, and descend to the ground, when he
may turn him to what place he pleases by guiding him with the
bridle."</p>

<p id="id03594">Notwithstanding all these arguments of the Hindoo, which carried
great appearance of probability, the emperor of Persia was much
alarmed at the evident danger of his son. "I suppose," replied
he, "it is very uncertain whether my son may perceive the other
peg, and make a right use of it; may not the horse, instead of
lighting on the ground, fall upon some rock, or tumble into the
sea with him?"</p>

<p id="id03595">"Sir," replied the Hindoo, "I can deliver your majesty from this
apprehension, by assuring you, that the horse crosses seas
without ever falling into them, and always carries his rider
wherever he may wish to go. And your majesty may assure yourself,
that if the prince does but find out the other peg I mentioned,
the horse will carry him where he pleases. It is not to be
supposed that he will stop any where but where he can find
assistance, and make himself known."</p>

<p id="id03596">"Be it as it may," replied the emperor of Persia, "as I cannot
depend upon the assurance you give me, your head shall answer for
my son's life, if he does not return safe in three days' time, or
I should hear that he is alive." He then ordered his officers to
secure the Hindoo, and keep him close prisoner; after which he
retired to his palace in affliction that the festival of Nooroze
should have proved so inauspicious.</p>

<p id="id03597">In the mean time the prince was carried through the air with
prodigious velocity; and in less than an hour's time had ascended
so high, that he could not distinguish any thing on the earth,
but mountains and plains seemed confounded together. It was then
he began to think of returning, and conceived he might do this by
turning the same peg the contrary way, and pulling the bridle at
the same time. But when he found that the horse still rose with
the same swiftness, his alarm was great. He turned the peg
several times, one way and the other, but all in vain. It was
then he grew sensible of his fault, in not having learnt the
necessary precautions to guide the horse before he mounted. He
immediately apprehended the great danger he was in, but that
apprehension did not deprive him of his reason. He examined the
horse's head and neck with attention, and perceived behind the
right ear another peg, smaller than the other. He turned that
peg, and presently perceived that he descended in the same
oblique manner as he had mounted, but not so swiftly.</p>

<p id="id03598">Night had overshadowed that part of the earth over which the
prince was when he found out and turned the small peg; and as the
horse descended, he by degrees lost sight of the sun, till it
grew quite dark; insomuch that, instead of choosing what place he
would go to, he was forced to let the bridle lie upon the horse's
neck, and wait patiently till he alighted, though not without the
dread lest it should be in the desert, a river, or the sea.</p>

<p id="id03599">At last the horse stopped upon some solid substance about
midnight, and the prince dismounted very faint and hungry, having
eaten nothing since the morning, when he came out of the palace
with his father to assist at the festival. He found himself to be
on the terrace of a magnificent palace, surrounded with a
balustrade of white marble, breast high; and groping about,
reached a staircase, which led down into an apartment, the door
of which was half open.</p>

<p id="id03600">Few but prince Firoze Shaw would have ventured to descend those
stairs dark as it was, and in the danger he exposed himself to
from friends or foes. But no consideration could stop him. "I do
not come," said he to himself, "to do anybody harm; and
certainly, whoever meets or sees me first, and finds that I have
no arms in my hands, will not attempt any thing against my life,
before they hear what I have to say for myself." After this
reflection, he opened the door wider, without making any noise,
went softly down the stairs, that he might not awaken anybody;
and when he came to a landing-place on the staircase, found the
door of a great hall, that had a light in it, open.</p>

<p id="id03601">The prince stopped at the door, and listening, heard no other noise
than the snoring of some people who were fast asleep. He advanced a
little into the room, and by the light of a lamp saw that those
persons were black eunuchs, with naked sabres laid by them; which was
enough to inform him that this was the guard-chamber of some sultan or
princess; which latter it proved to be.</p>

<p id="id03602">In the next room to this the princess lay, as appeared by the light,
the door being open, through a silk curtain, which drew before the
door-way, whither prince Firoze Shaw advanced on tip-toe, without
waking the eunuchs. He drew aside the curtain, went in, and without
staying to observe the magnificence of the chamber, gave his attention
to something of greater importance. He saw many beds; only one of them
on a sofa, the rest on the floor. The princess slept in the first, and
her women in the others.</p>

<p id="id03603">This distinction was enough to direct the prince. He crept softly
towards the bed, without waking either the princess or her women,
and beheld a beauty so extraordinary, that he was charmed, and
inflamed with love at the first sight. "O heavens!" said he to
himself, "has my fate brought me hither to deprive me of my
liberty, which hitherto I have always preserved? How can I avoid
certain slavery, when those eyes shall open, since, without
doubt, they complete the lustre of this assemblage of charms! I
must quickly resolve, since I cannot stir without being my own
murderer; for so has necessity ordained."</p>

<p id="id03604">After these reflections on his situation, and on the princess's
beauty, he fell on his knees, and twitching gently the princess's
sleeve, pulled it towards him. The princess opened her eyes, and
seeing a handsome man on his knees, was in great surprise; yet
seemed to shew no sign of fear.</p>

<p id="id03605">The prince availed himself of this favourable moment, bowed his
head to the ground, and rising said, "Beautiful princess, by the
most extraordinary and wonderful adventure, you see at your feet
a suppliant prince, son of the emperor of Persia, who was
yesterday morning in his court, at the celebration of a solemn
festival, but is now in a strange country, in danger of his life,
if you have not the goodness and generosity to afford him your
assistance and protection. These I implore, adorable princess,
with confidence that you will not refuse me. I have the more
ground to persuade myself, as so much beauty and majesty cannot
entertain inhumanity."</p>

<p id="id03606">The personage to whom prince Firoze Shaw so happily addressed
himself was the princess of Bengal, eldest daughter of the Rajah
of that kingdom, who had built this palace at a small distance
from his capital, whither she went to take the benefit of the
country air. After she had heard the prince with all the candour
he could desire, she replied with equal goodness, "Prince, you
are not in a barbarous country; take courage; hospitality,
humanity, and politeness are to be met with in the kingdom of
Bengal, as well as in that of Persia. It is not merely I who
grant you the protection you ask; you not only have found it in
my palace, but will meet it throughout the whole kingdom; you may
believe me, and depend on what I say."</p>

<p id="id03607">The prince of Persia would have thanked the princess for her
civility, and had already bowed down his head to return the
compliment; but she would not give him leave to speak.
"Notwithstanding I desire," said she, "to know by what miracle
you have come hither from the capital of Persia in so short a
time; and by what enchantment you have been able to penetrate so
far as to come to my apartment, and to have evaded the vigilance
of my guards; yet, as it is impossible but you must want some
refreshment, and regarding you as a welcome guest, I will waive
my curiosity, and give orders to my women to regale you, and shew
you an apartment, that you may rest yourself after your fatigue,
and be better able to satisfy my curiosity."</p>

<p id="id03608">The princess's women, who awoke at the first words which the
prince addressed to the princess, were in the utmost surprise to
see a man at the princess's feet, as they could not conceive how
he had got thither, without waking them or the eunuchs. They no
sooner comprehended the princess's intentions, than they were
ready to obey her commands. They each took a wax candle, of which
there were great numbers lighted up in the room; and after the
prince had respectfully taken leave, went before and conducted
him into a handsome chamber; where, while some were preparing the
bed, others went into the kitchen; and notwithstanding it was so
unseasonable an hour, they did not make prince Firoze Shaw wait
long, but brought him presently a collation; and when he had
eaten as much as he chose, removed the trays, and left him to
taste the sweets of repose.</p>

<p id="id03609">In the mean time, the princess of Bengal was so struck with the
charms, wit, politeness, and other good qualities which she had
discovered in her short interview with the prince, that she could
not sleep: but when her women came into her room again asked them
if they had taken care of him, if he wanted any thing; and
particularly, what they thought of him?</p>

<p id="id03610">The women, after they had satisfied her as to the first queries,
answered to the last: "We do not know what you may think of him,
but, for our parts, we are of opinion you would be very happy if
your father would marry you to so amiable a youth; for there is
not a prince in all the kingdom of Bengal to be compared to him;
nor can we hear that any of the neighbouring princes are worthy
of you."</p>

<p id="id03611">This flattering compliment was not displeasing to the princess of
Bengal; but as she had no mind to declare her sentiments, she
imposed silence, telling them that they talked without
reflection, bidding them return to rest, and let her sleep.</p>

<p id="id03612">The next day the princess took more pains in dressing and
adjusting herself at the glass than she had ever done before. She
never tired her women's patience so much, by making them do and
undo the same thing several times. She adorned her head, neck,
arms, and waist, with the finest and largest diamonds she
possessed. The habit she put on was one of the richest stuffs of
the Indies, of a most beautiful colour, and made only for kings,
princes, and princesses. After she had consulted her glass, and
asked her women, one after another, if any thing was wanting to
her attire, she sent to know, if the prince of Persia was awake;
and as she never doubted but that, if he was up and dressed, he
would ask leave to come and pay his respects to her, she charged
the messenger to tell him she would make him the visit, and she
had her reasons for this.</p>

<p id="id03613">The prince of Persia, who by the night's rest had recovered the
fatigue he had undergone the day before, had just dressed
himself, when he received the princess of Bengal's compliments by
one of her women. Without giving the lady who brought the message
leave to communicate it, he asked her, if it was proper for him
then to go and pay his respects to the princess; and when the
lady had acquitted herself of her errand, he replied, "It shall
be as the princess thinks fit; I came here to be solely at her
pleasure."</p>

<p id="id03614">As soon as the princess understood that the prince of Persia
waited for her, she immediately went to pay him a visit. After
mutual compliments, the prince asking pardon for having waked the
princess out of a profound sleep, and the princess inquiring
after his health, and how he had rested, the princess sat down on
a sofa, as did also the prince, though at some distance, out of
respect.</p>

<p id="id03615">The princess then resuming the conversation, said, "I would have
received you, prince, in the chamber in which you found me last
night; but as the chief of my eunuchs has the liberty of entering
it, and never comes further without my leave, from my impatience
to hear the surprising adventure which procured me the happiness
of seeing you, I chose to come hither, that we may not be
interrupted; therefore I beg of you to give me that satisfaction,
which will highly oblige me."</p>

<p id="id03616">Prince Firoze Shaw, to gratify the princess of Bengal, began with
describing the festival of the Nooroze, and mentioned the shows
which had amazed the court of Persia, and the people of Sheerauz.
Afterwards he came to the enchanted horse; the description of
which, with the account of the wonders which the Hindoo had
performed before so august an assembly, convinced the princess
that nothing of that kind could be imagined more surprising in
the world. "You may well think, charming princess," continued the
prince of Persia, "that the emperor my father, who cares not what
he gives for any thing that is rare and curious, would be very
desirous to purchase such a curiosity. He asked the Hindoo what
he would have for him; who made him an extravagant reply, telling
him, that he had not bought him, but taken him in exchange for
his only daughter, and could not part with him but on the like
condition, which was to have his consent to marry the princess my
sister.</p>

<p id="id03617">"The crowd of courtiers, who stood about the emperor my father,
hearing the extravagance of this proposal, laughed loudly; I for
my part conceived such great indignation, that I could not
disguise it; and the more, because I saw that my father was
doubtful what answer he should give. In short, I believe he would
have granted him what he asked, if I had not represented to him
how injurious it would be to his honour; yet my remonstrance
could not bring him entirely to quit his design of sacrificing
the princess my sister to so despicable a person. He fancied he
should bring me over to his opinion, if once I could comprehend,
as he imagined he did, the singular worth of this horse. With
this view he would have me mount, and make a trial of him myself.</p>

<p id="id03618">"To please my father, I mounted the horse, and as soon as I was
upon his back, put my hand on a peg, as I had seen the Hindoo do
before, to make the horse mount into the air, without stopping to
take instructions of the owner for his guidance or descent. The
instant I touched the peg, the horse ascended, as swift as an
arrow shot out of a bow, and I was presently at such a distance
from the earth that I could not distinguish any object. From the
swiftness of the motion I was for some time unapprehensive of the
danger to which I was exposed; when I grew sensible of it, I
endeavoured to turn the peg the contrary way. But the experiment
would not answer my expectation, for still the horse rose, and
carried me a greater distance from the earth. At last I perceived
another peg, which I turned, and then I grew sensible that the
horse descended towards the earth, and presently found myself so
surrounded with darkness, that it was impossible for me to guide
the machine. In this condition I laid the bridle on his neck, and
trusted myself to the will of God to dispose of my fate.</p>

<p id="id03619">"At length the horse stopped, I got off his back, and examining
whereabouts I might be, perceived myself on the terrace of this
palace, and found the door of the staircase half open. I came
softly down the stairs, and seeing a door open, put my head into
the room, perceived some eunuchs asleep, and a great light in an
adjoining chamber. The necessity I was under, notwithstanding the
inevitable danger to which I should be exposed, if the eunuchs
had waked, inspired me with the boldness, or rather rashness, to
cross that room to get to the other.</p>

<p id="id03620">"It is needless," added the prince, "to tell you the rest, since
you are not unacquainted with all that passed afterwards. But I
am obliged in duty to thank you for your goodness and generosity,
and to beg of you to let me know how I may shew my gratitude.
According to the law of nations I am already your slave, and
cannot make you an offer of my person; there only remains my
heart: but, alas! princess, what do I say? My heart is no longer
my own, your charms have forced it from me, but in such a manner,
that I will never ask for it again, but yield it up; give me
leave, therefore, to declare you mistress both of my heart and
inclination."</p>

<p id="id03621">These last words of the prince were pronounced with such an air
and tone, that the princess of Bengal never doubted of the effect
she had expected from her charms; neither did she seem to resent
the precipitate declaration of the prince of Persia. Her blushes
served but to heighten her beauty, and render her more amiable in
his eyes.</p>

<p id="id03622">As soon as she had recovered herself, she replied, "Prince, you
have given me sensible pleasure, by telling me your wonderful
adventure. But, on the other hand, I can hardly forbear
shuddering, when I think on the height you were in the air; and
though I have the good fortune to see you here safe and well, I
was in pain till you came to that part where the horse
fortunately descended upon the terrace of my palace. The same
thing might have happened in a thousand other places. I am glad
that chance has given me the preference to the whole world, and
of the opportunity of letting you know, that it could not have
conducted you to any place where you could have been received
with greater pleasure.</p>

<p id="id03623">"But, prince," continued she, "I should think myself offended, if
I believed that the thought you mentioned of being my slave was
serious, and that it did not proceed from your politeness rather
than from a sincerity of sentiment; for, by the reception I gave
you yesterday, you might assure yourself you are here as much at
liberty as in the midst of the court of Persia.</p>

<p id="id03624">"As to your heart," added the princess, in a tone which shewed
nothing less than a refusal, "as I am persuaded that you have not
lived so long without disposing of it, and that you could not
fail of making choice of a princess who deserves it, I should be
sorry to give you an occasion to be guilty of infidelity to her."</p>

<p id="id03625">Prince Firoze Shaw would have protested that when he left Persia
he was master of his own heart: but, at that instant, one of the
princess's ladies in waiting came to tell that a collation was
served up.</p>

<p id="id03626">This interruption delivered the prince and princess from an
explanation, which would have been equally embarrassing to both,
and of which they stood in need. The princess of Bengal was fully
convinced of the prince of Persia's sincerity; and the prince,
though the princess had not explained herself, judged
nevertheless from some words she had let fall, that he had no
reason to complain.</p>

<p id="id03627">As the lady held the door open, the princess of Bengal said to
the prince, rising off her seat, as he did also from his, "I am
not used to eat so early; but as I fancied you might have had but
an indifferent supper last night, I ordered breakfast to be got
ready sooner than ordinary." After this compliment she led him
into a magnificent hall, where a cloth was laid covered with
great plenty of choice and excellent viands; and as soon as they
were seated, many beautiful slaves of the princess, richly
dressed, began a most agreeable concert of vocal and instrumental
music, which lasted the whole time of eating.</p>

<p id="id03628">This concert was so sweet and well managed, that it did not in
the least interrupt the prince and princess's conversation. The
prince served the princess with the choicest of every thing, and
strove to outdo her in civility, both by words and actions, which
she returned with many new compliments: and in this reciprocal
commerce of civilities and attentions, love made a greater
progress in both than a concerted interview would have promoted.</p>

<p id="id03629">When they rose, the princess conducted the prince into a large
and magnificent saloon, embellished with paintings in blue and
gold, and richly furnished; there they both sat down in a
balcony, which afforded a most agreeable prospect into the palace
garden, which prince Firoze Shaw admired for the vast variety of
flowers, shrubs, and trees, which were full as beautiful as those
of Persia, but quite different. Here taking the opportunity of
entering into conversation with the princess, he said, "I always
believed, madam, that no part of the world but Persia afforded
such stately palaces and beautiful gardens; but now I see, that
other great monarchs know as well how to build mansions suitable
to their power and greatness; and if there is a difference in the
manner of building, there is none in the degree of grandeur and
magnificence."</p>

<p id="id03630">"Prince," replied the princess of Bengal, "as I have no idea of
the palaces of Persia, I cannot judge of the comparison you have
made of mine. But, however sincere you seem to be, I can hardly
think it just, but rather incline to believe it a compliment: I
will not despise my palace before you; you have too good an eye,
too good a taste not to form a sound judgment. But I assure you,
I think it very indifferent when I compare it with the king my
father's, which far exceeds it for grandeur, beauty, and
richness; you shall tell me yourself what you think of it, when
you have seen it: for since a chance has brought you so nigh to
the capital of this kingdom, I do not doubt but you will see it,
and make my father a visit, that he may pay you all the honour
due to a prince of your rank and merit."</p>

<p id="id03631">The princess flattered herself, that by exciting in the prince of
Persia a curiosity to see the capital of Bengal, and to visit her
father, the king, seeing him so handsome, wise, and accomplished
a prince, might perhaps resolve to propose an alliance with him,
by offering her to him as a wife. And as she was well persuaded
she was not indifferent to the prince, and that he would be
pleased with the proposal, she hoped to attain to the utmost of
her wishes, and preserve all the decorum becoming a princess, who
would appear resigned to the will of her king and father; but the
prince of Persia did not return her an answer according to her
expectation.</p>

<p id="id03632">"Princess," he replied, "the preference which you give the king
of Bengal's palace to your own is enough to induce me to believe
it much exceeds it: and as to the proposal of my going and paying
my respects to the king your father, I should not only do myself
a pleasure, but an honour. But judge, princess, yourself, would
you advise me to present myself before so great a monarch, like
an adventurer, without attendants, and a train suitable to my
rank?"</p>

<p id="id03633">"Prince," replied the princess, "let not that give you any pain;
if you will but go, you shall want no money to have what train
and attendants you please: I will furnish you; and we have
traders here of all nations in great numbers, and you may make
choice of as many as you please to form your household."</p>

<p id="id03634">Prince Firoze Shaw penetrated the princess of Bengal's intention,
and this sensible mark of her love still augmented his passion,
which, notwithstanding its violence, made him not forget his
duty. Without any hesitation he replied, "Princess, I should most
willingly accept of the obliging offer you make me, for which I
cannot sufficiently shew my gratitude, if the uneasiness my
father must feel on account of my absence did not prevent me. I
should be unworthy of the tenderness he has always had for me, if
I should not return as soon as possible to calm his fears. I know
him so well, that while I have the happiness of enjoying the
conversation of so lovely a princess, I am persuaded he is
plunged into the deepest grief, and has lost all hopes of seeing
me again. I trust you will do me the justice to believe, that I
cannot, without ingratitude, and being guilty of a crime,
dispense with going to restore to him that life, which a too long
deferred return may have endangered already.</p>

<p id="id03635">"After this, princess," continued the prince of Persia, "if you
will permit me, and think me worthy to aspire to the happiness of
becoming your husband, as my father has always declared that he
never would constrain me in my choice, I should find it no
difficult matter to get leave to return, not as a stranger, but
as a prince, to contract an alliance with your father by our
marriage; and I am persuaded that the emperor will be overjoyed
when I tell him with what generosity you received me, though a
stranger in distress."</p>

<p id="id03636">The princess of Bengal was too reasonable, after what the prince
of Persia had said, to persist any longer in persuading him to
pay a visit to the raja of Bengal, or to ask any thing of him
contrary to his duty and honour. But she was much alarmed to find
he thought of so sudden a departure; fearing, that if he took his
leave of her so soon, instead of remembering his promise, he
would forget when he ceased to see her. To divert him from his
purpose, she said to him, "Prince, my intention of proposing a
visit to my father was not to oppose so just a duty as that you
mention, and which I did not foresee. But I cannot approve of
your going so soon as you propose; at least grant me the favour I
ask of a little longer acquaintance; and since I have had the
happiness to have you alight in the kingdom of Bengal, rather
than in the midst of a desert, or on the top of some steep craggy
rock, from which it would have been impossible for you to
descend, I desire you will stay long enough to enable you to give
a better account at the court of Persia of what you may see
here."</p>

<p id="id03637">The sole end the princess had in this request was, that the
prince of Persia, by a longer stay, might become insensibly more
passionately enamoured of her charms; hoping thereby that his
ardent desire of returning would diminish, and then he might be
brought to appear in public, and pay a visit to the Rajah of
Bengal. The prince of Persia could not well refuse her the favour
she asked, after the kind reception she had given him; and
therefore politely complied with her request; and the princess's
thoughts were directed to render his stay agreeable by all the
amusements she could devise.</p>

<p id="id03638">Nothing went forward for several days but concerts of music,
accompanied with magnificent feasts and collations in the
gardens, or hunting-parties in the vicinity of the palace, which
abounded with all sorts of game, stags, hinds, and fallow deer,
and other beasts peculiar to the kingdom of Bengal, which the
princess could pursue without danger. After the chase, the prince
and princess met in some beautiful spot, where a carpet was
spread, and cushions laid for their accommodation. There resting
themselves, after their violent exercise, they conversed on
various subjects. The princess took pains to turn the
conversation on the grandeur, power, riches, and government of
Persia; that from the prince's replies she might have an
opportunity to talk of the kingdom of Bengal, and its advantages,
and engage him to resolve to make a longer stay there; but she
was disappointed in her expectations.</p>

<p id="id03639">The prince of Persia, without the least exaggeration, gave so
advantageous an account of the extent of the kingdom of Persia,
its magnificence and riches, its military force, its commerce by
sea and land with the most remote parts of the world, some of
which were unknown even to him; the vast number of large cities
it contained, almost as populous as that which the emperor had
chosen for his residence, where he had palaces furnished ready to
receive him at all seasons of the year; so that he had his choice
always to enjoy a perpetual spring; that before he had concluded,
the princess found the kingdom of Bengal to be very much inferior
to that of Persia in a great many respects. When he had finished
his relation, he begged of her to entertain him with a
description of Bengal.</p>

<p id="id03640">The princess after much entreaty gave prince Firoze Shaw that
satisfaction; but by lessening a great many advantages the
kingdom of Bengal was well known to have over that of Persia, she
betrayed the disposition she felt to accompany him, so that he
believed she would consent at the first proposition he should
make; but he thought it would not be proper to make it till he
had shewed her so much deference as to stay with her long enough
to make the blame fall on herself, in case she wished to detain
him from returning to his father.</p>

<p id="id03641">Two whole months the prince of Persia abandoned himself entirely
to the will of the princess of Bengal, yielding to all the
amusements she contrived for him, for she neglected nothing to
divert him, as if she thought he had nothing else to do but to
pass his whole life with her in this manner. But he now declared
seriously he could not stay longer, and begged of her to give him
leave to return to his father; repeating again the promise he had
made her to come back soon in a style worthy of her and himself,
and to demand her in marriage of the Rajah of Bengal.</p>

<p id="id03642">"And, princess," observed the prince of Persia, "that you may not
suspect the truth of what I say; and that by my asking this
permission you may not rank me among those false lovers who
forget the object of their affection as soon as absent from them;
to shew that my passion is real, and not feigned, and that life
cannot be pleasant to me when absent from so lovely a princess,
whose love to me I cannot doubt is mutual; I would presume, were
I not afraid you would be offended at my request, to ask the
favour of taking you along with me."</p>

<p id="id03643">As the prince saw that the princess blushed at these words,
without any mark of anger, he proceeded, and said, "Princess, as
for my father's consent, and the reception he will give you, I
venture to assure you he will receive you with pleasure into his
alliance; and as for the Rajah of Bengal, after all the love and
tender regard he has always expressed for you, he must be the
reverse of what you have described him, an enemy to your repose
and happiness, if he should not receive in a friendly manner the
embassy which my father will send to him for his approbation of
our marriage."</p>

<p id="id03644">The princess returned no answer to this address of the prince of
Persia; but her silence, and eyes cast down, were sufficient to
inform him that she had no reluctance to accompany him into
Persia. The only difficulty she felt was, that the prince knew
not well enough how to govern the horse, and she was apprehensive
of being involved with him in the same difficulty as when he
first made the experiment. But the prince soon removed her fear,
by assuring her she might trust herself with him, for that after
the experience he had acquired, he defied the Hindoo himself to
manage him better. She thought therefore only of concerting
measures to get off with him so secretly, that nobody belonging
to the palace should have the least suspicion of their design.</p>

<p id="id03645">The next morning, a little before day-break, when all the
attendants were asleep, they went upon the terrace of the palace.
The prince turned the horse towards Persia, and placed him where
the princess could easily get up behind him; which she had no
sooner done, and was well settled with her arms about his waist,
for her better security, than he turned the peg, when the horse
mounted into the air, and making his usual haste, under the
guidance of the prince, in two hours time the prince discovered
the capital of Persia.</p>

<p id="id03646">He would not alight at the great square from whence he had set
out, nor in the palace, but directed his course towards a
pleasure-house at a little distance from the capital. He led the
princess into a handsome apartment, where he told her, that to do
her all the honour that was due to her, he would go and inform
his father of their arrival, and return to her immediately. He
ordered the housekeeper of the palace, who was then present, to
provide the princess with whatever she had occasion for.</p>

<p id="id03647">After the prince had taken his leave of the princess, he ordered
a horse to be saddled, which he mounted, after sending back the
housekeeper to the princess, with orders to provide her
refreshments immediately, and then set forwards for the palace.
As he passed through the streets he was received with
acclamations by the people, who were overjoyed to see him again.
The emperor his father was giving audience, when he appeared
before him in the midst of his council. He received him with
ecstacy, and embracing him with tears of joy and tenderness,
asked him, what was become of the Hindoo's horse.</p>

<p id="id03648">This question gave the prince an opportunity of describing the
embarrassment and danger he was in when the horse ascended into
the air, and how he had arrived at last at the princess of
Bengal's palace, the kind reception he had met with there, and
that the motive which had induced him to stay so long with her
was the affection she had shewn him; also, that after promising
to marry her, he had persuaded her to accompany him into Persia.
"But, sir," added the prince, "I felt assured that you would not
refuse your consent, and have brought her with me on the
enchanted horse, to a palace where your majesty often goes for
your pleasure; and have left her there, till I could return and
assure her that my promise was not in vain."</p>

<p id="id03649">After these words, the prince prostrated himself before the
emperor to obtain his consent, when his father raised him up,
embraced him a second time, and said to him, "Son, I not only
consent to your marriage with the princess of Bengal, but will go
and meet her myself, and thank her for the obligation I in
particular have to her, and will bring her to my palace, and
celebrate your nuptials this day."</p>

<p id="id03650">The emperor now gave orders for his court to make preparations
for the princess's entry; that the rejoicings should be announced
by the royal band of military music, and that the Hindoo should
be fetched out of prison and brought before him. When the Hindoo
was conducted before the emperor, he said to him, "I secured thy
person, that thy life, though not a sufficient victim to my rage
and grief, might answer for that of the prince my son, whom,
however, thanks to God! I have found again: go, take your horse,
and never let me see your face more."</p>

<p id="id03651">As the Hindoo had learned of those who brought him out of prison
that prince Firoze Shaw was returned with a princess, and was
also informed of the place where he had alighted and left her,
and that the emperor was making preparations to go and bring her
to his palace; as soon as he got out of the presence, he
bethought himself of being revenged upon the emperor and the
prince. Without losing any time, he went directly to the palace,
and addressing himself to the keeper, told him, he came from the
prince of Persia for the princess of Bengal, and to conduct her
behind him through the air to the emperor, who waited in the
great square of his palace to gratify the whole court and city of
Sheerauz with that wonderful sight.</p>

<p id="id03652">The palace-keeper, who knew the Hindoo, and that the emperor had
imprisoned him, gave the more credit to what he said, because he
saw that he was at liberty. He presented him to the princess of
Bengal; who no sooner understood that he came from the prince of
Persia than she consented to what the prince, as she thought, had
desired of her.</p>

<p id="id03653">The Hindoo, overjoyed at his success, and the ease with which he
had accomplished his villany, mounted his horse, took the
princess behind him, with the assistance of the keeper, turned
the peg, and instantly the horse mounted into the air.</p>

<p id="id03654">At the same time the emperor of Persia, attended by his court,
was on the road to the palace where the princess of Bengal had
been left, and the prince of Persia was advanced before, to
prepare the princess to receive his father; when the Hindoo, to
brave them both, and revenge himself for the ill-treatment he had
received, appeared over their heads with his prize.</p>

<p id="id03655">When the emperor of Persia saw the ravisher, he stopped. His
surprise and affliction were the more sensible, because it was
not in his power to punish so high an affront. He loaded him with
a thousand imprecations, as did also all the courtiers, who were
witnesses of so signal a piece of insolence and unparalleled
artifice and treachery.</p>

<p id="id03656">The Hindoo, little moved with their curses, which just reached
his ears, continued his way, while the emperor, extremely
mortified at so great an insult, but more so that he could not
punish the author, returned to his palace in rage and vexation.</p>

<p id="id03657">But what was prince Firoze Shaw's grief at beholding the Hindoo
hurrying away the princess of Bengal, whom he loved so
passionately that he could not live without her! At a spectacle
so little expected he was confounded, and before he could
deliberate with himself what measures to pursue, the horse was
out of sight. He could not resolve how to act, whether he should
return to his father's palace, and shut himself in his apartment,
to give himself entirely up to his affliction, without attempting
to pursue the ravisher. But as his generosity, love, and courage,
would not suffer this, he continued on his way to the palace
where he had left his princess.</p>

<p id="id03658">When he arrived, the palace-keeper, who was by this time
convinced of his fatal credulity, in believing the artful Hindoo,
threw himself at his feet with tears in his eyes, accused himself
of the crime, which unintentionally he had committed, and
condemned himself to die by his hand. "Rise," said the prince to
him, "I do not impute the loss of my princess to thee, but to my
own want of precaution. But not to lose time, fetch me a
dervish's habit, and take care you do not give the least hint
that it is for me."</p>

<p id="id03659">Not far from this palace there stood a convent of dervishes, the
superior of which was the palace-keeper's particular friend. He
went to his chief, and telling him that a considerable officer at
court and a man of worth, to whom he had been very much obliged
and wished to favour, by giving him an opportunity to withdraw
from some sudden displeasure of the emperor, readily obtained a
complete dervish's habit, and carried it to prince Firoze Shaw.
The prince immediately pulled off his own dress, put it on, and
being so disguised, and provided with a box of jewels, which he
had brought as a present to the princess, left the palace,
uncertain which way to go, but resolved not to return till he had
found out his princess, and brought her back again, or perish in
the attempt.</p>

<p id="id03660">But to return to the Hindoo; he governed his enchanted horse so
well, that he arrived early next morning in a wood, near the
capital of the kingdom of Cashmeer. Being hungry, and concluding
the princess was so also, he alighted in that wood, in an open
part of it, and left the princess on a grassy spot, close to a
rivulet of clear fresh water.</p>

<p id="id03661">During the Hindoo's absence, the princess of Bengal, who knew
that she was in the power of a base ravisher, whose violence she
dreaded, thought of escaping from him, and seeking out for some
sanctuary. But as she had eaten scarcely any thing on her arrival
at the palace, was so faint, that she could not execute her
design, but was forced to abandon it and stay where she was,
without any other resource than her courage, and a firm
resolution rather to suffer death than be unfaithful to the
prince of Persia. When the Hindoo returned, she did not wait to
be entreated, but ate with him, and recovered herself enough to
answer with courage to the insolent language he now began to hold
to her. After many threats, as she saw that the Hindoo was
preparing to use violence, she rose up to make resistance, and by
her cries and shrieks drew towards them a company of horsemen,
which happened to be the sultan of Cashmeer and his attendants,
who, as they were returning from hunting, happily for the
princess of Bengal, passed through that part of the wood, and ran
to her assistance, at the noise she made.</p>

<p id="id03662">The sultan addressed himself to the Hindoo, demanded who he was,
and wherefore he ill treated the lady? The Hindoo, with great
impudence, replied, "That she was his wife, and what had any one
to do with his quarrel with her?"</p>

<p id="id03663">The princess, who neither knew the rank nor quality of the person
who came so seasonably to her relief, told the Hindoo he was a
liar; and said to the sultan, "My lord, whoever you are whom
Heaven has sent to my assistance, have compassion on a princess,
and give no credit to that impostor. Heaven forbid that I should
be the wife of so vile and despicable a Hindoo! a wicked
magician, who has forced me away from the prince of Persia, to
whom I was going to be united, and has brought me hither on the
enchanted horse you behold there."</p>

<p id="id03664">The princess of Bengal had no occasion to say more to persuade
the sultan of Cashmeer that what she told him was truth. Her
beauty, majestic air, and tears, spoke sufficiently for her.
Justly enraged at the insolence of the Hindoo, he ordered his
guards to surround him, and strike off his head: which sentence
was immediately executed.</p>

<p id="id03665">The princess, thus delivered from the persecution of the Hindoo,
fell into another no less afflicting. The sultan conducted her to
his palace, where he lodged her in the most magnificent
apartment, next his own, commanded a great number of women slaves
to attend her, and ordered a guard of eunuchs. He led her himself
into the apartment he had assigned her; where, without giving her
time to thank him for the great obligation she had received, he
said to her, "As I am certain, princess, that you must want rest,
I will take my leave of you till to-morrow, when you will be
better able to relate to me the circumstances of this strange
adventure;" and then left her.</p>

<p id="id03666">The princess of Bengal's joy was inexpressible at finding herself
delivered from the violence of the Hindoo, of whom she could not
think without horror. She flattered herself that the sultan of
Cashmeer would complete his generosity by sending her back to the
prince of Persia when she should have told him her story, and
asked that favour of him; but she was much deceived in these
hopes; for her deliverer had resolved to marry her himself the
next day; and for that end had ordered rejoicings to be made by
day-break, by beating of drums, sounding of trumpets, and other
instruments expressive of joy; which not only echoed through the
palace, but throughout the whole city.</p>

<p id="id03667">The princess of Bengal was awakened by these tumultuous concerts;
but attributed them to a very different cause from the true one.
When the sultan of Cashmeer, who had given orders that he should
be informed when the princess was ready to receive a visit, came
to wait upon her; after he had inquired after her health, he
acquainted her that all those rejoicings were to render their
nuptials the more solemn; and at the same time desired her assent
to the union. This declaration put her into such agitation that
she fainted away.</p>

<p id="id03668">The women-slaves, who were present, ran to her assistance; and
the sultan did all he could to bring her to herself, though it
was a long time before they succeeded. But when she recovered,
rather than break the promise she had made to prince Firoze Shaw,
by consenting to marry the sultan of Cashmeer, who had proclaimed
their nuptials before he had asked her consent, she resolved to
feign madness. She began to utter the most extravagant
expressions before the sultan, and even rose off her seat as if
to attack him; insomuch that he was greatly alarmed and
afflicted, that he had made such a proposal so unseasonably.</p>

<p id="id03669">When he found that her frenzy rather increased than abated, he
left her with her women, charging them never to leave her alone,
but to take great care of her. He sent often that day to inquire
how she did; but received no other answer than that she was
rather worse than better. At night she seemed more indisposed
than she had been all day, insomuch that the sultan deferred the
happiness he had promised himself.</p>

<p id="id03670">The princess of Bengal continued to talk wildly, and shew other
marks of a disordered mind, next day and the following; so that
the sultan was induced to send for all the physicians belonging
to his court, to consult them upon her disease, and to ask if
they could cure her.</p>

<p id="id03671">The physicians all agreed that there were several sorts and
degrees of this disorder, some curable and others not; and told
the sultan, that they could not judge of the princess of Bengal's
unless they might see her; upon which the sultan ordered the
eunuchs to introduce them into the princess's chamber, one after
another, according to their rank.</p>

<p id="id03672">The princess, who foresaw what would happen, and feared, that if
she let the physicians feel her pulse, the least experienced of
them would soon know that she was in good health, and that her
madness was only feigned, flew into such a well-dissembled rage
and passion, that she appeared ready to injure those who came
near her; so none of them durst approach her.</p>

<p id="id03673">Some who pretended to be more skilful than the rest, and boasted
of judging of diseases only by sight, ordered her some potions,
which she made the less difficulty to take, well knowing she
could be sick or well at pleasure, and that they could do her no
harm.</p>

<p id="id03674">When the sultan of Cashmeer saw that his court physicians could
not cure her, he called in the most celebrated and experienced of
the city, who had no better success. Afterwards he sent for the
most famous in the kingdom, who met with no better reception than
the others from the princess, and what they prescribed had no
effect. Afterwards he dispatched expresses to the courts of
neighbouring sultans, with the princess's case, to be distributed
among the most famous physicians, with a promise of a munificent
reward to any of them who should come and effect her cure.</p>

<p id="id03675">Various physicians arrived from all parts, and tried their skill;
but none could boast of better success than their predecessors,
or of restoring the princess's faculties, since it was a case
that did not depend on medicine, but on the will of the princess
herself.</p>

<p id="id03676">During this interval Firoze Shaw, disguised in the habit of a
dervish, travelled through many provinces and towns, involved in
grief; and endured excessive fatigue, not knowing which way to
direct his course, or whether he might not be pursuing the very
opposite road from what he ought, in order to hear the tidings he
was in search of. He made diligent inquiry after her at every
place he came to; till at last passing through a city of
Hindoostan, he heard the people talk much of a princess of
Bengal, who ran mad on the day of the intended celebration of her
nuptials with the sultan of Cashmeer. At the name of the princess
of Bengal, and supposing that there could exist no other princess
of Bengal than her upon whose account he had undertaken his
travels, he hastened towards the kingdom of Cashmeer, and upon
his arrival at the capital took up his lodging at a khan, where
the same day he was informed of the story of the princess, and
the fate of the Hindoo magician, which he had so richly deserved.
From the circumstances, the prince was convinced that she was the
beloved object he had sought so long.</p>

<p id="id03677">Being informed of all these particulars, he provided himself
against the next day with a physician's habit, and having let his
beard grow during his travels, he passed the more easily for the
character he assumed, went to the palace, impatient to behold his
beloved, where he presented himself to the chief of the officers,
and observed modestly, that perhaps it might be looked upon as a
rash undertaking to attempt the cure of the princess, after so
many had failed; but that he hoped some specifics, from which he
had experienced success, might effect the desired relief. The
chief of the officers told him he was welcome, that the sultan
would receive him with pleasure, and that if he should have the
good fortune to restore the princess to her former health, he
might expect a considerable reward from his master's liberality:
"Stay a moment," added he, "I will come to you again
immediately."</p>

<p id="id03678">Some time had elapsed since any physician had offered himself;
and the sultan of Cashmeer with great grief had begun to lose all
hope of ever seeing the princess restored to health, that he
might marry, and shew how much he loved her. He ordered the
officer to introduce the physician he had announced.</p>

<p id="id03679">The prince of Persia was presented, when the sultan, without
wasting time in superfluous discourse, after having told him the
princess of Bengal could not bear the sight of a physician
without falling into most violent transports, which increased her
malady, conducted him into a closet, from whence, through a
lattice, he might see her without being observed.</p>

<p id="id03680">There Firoze Shaw beheld his lovely princess sitting melancholy,
with tears in her eyes, and singing an air in which she deplored
her unhappy fate, which had deprived her, perhaps, for ever, of
the object she loved so tenderly.</p>

<p id="id03681">The prince was sensibly affected at the melancholy condition in
which he found his dear princess, but he wanted no other signs to
comprehend that her disorder was feigned, or that it was for love
of him that she was under so grievous an affliction. When he came
out of the closet, he told the sultan that he had discovered the
nature of the princess's complaint, and that she was not
incurable; but added withal, that he must speak with her in
private, and alone, as, notwithstanding her violent agitation at
the sight of physicians, he hoped she would hear and receive him
favourably.</p>

<p id="id03682">The sultan ordered the princess's chamber door to be opened, and
Firoze Shaw went in. As soon as the princess saw him (taking him
by his habit to be a physician), she rose up in a rage,
threatening him, and giving him the most abusive language. He
made directly towards her, and when he was nigh enough for her to
hear him, for he did not wish to be heard by any one else, said
to her, in a low voice, "Princess, I am not a physician, but the
prince of Persia, and am come to procure you your liberty."</p>

<p id="id03683">The princess, who knew the sound of the voice, and the upper
features of his face, notwithstanding he had let his beard grow
so long, grew calm at once, and a secret joy and pleasure
overspread her face, the effect of seeing the person so much
desired so unexpectedly. Her agreeable surprise deprived her for
some time of the use of speech, and gave Firoze Shaw time to tell
her as briefly as possible, how despair had seized him when he
saw the Hindoo carry her away; the resolution he afterwards had
taken to leave every thing to find her out, and never to return
home till he had regained her out of the hands of the perfidious
wretch; and by what good fortune, at last, after a long and
fatiguing journey, he had the satisfaction to find her in the
palace of the sultan of Cashmeer. He then desired the princess to
inform him of all that happened to her, from the time she was
taken away, till that moment when he had the happiness to
converse with her, telling her, that it was of the greatest
importance to know this, that he might take the most proper
measures to deliver her from the tyranny of the sultan of
Cashmeer.</p>

<p id="id03684">The princess informed him how she was delivered from the Hindoo's
violence by the sultan, as he was returning from hunting; how she
was alarmed the next day, by a declaration he had made of his
precipitate design to marry her, without even the ceremony of
asking her consent; that this violent and tyrannical conduct put
her into a swoon; after which she thought she had no other way
than what she had taken, to preserve herself for a prince to whom
she had given her heart and faith; or die, rather than marry the
sultan, whom she neither loved, nor could ever love.</p>

<p id="id03685">The prince of Persia then asked her, if she knew what became of
the horse, after the death of the Hindoo magician. To which she
answered, that she knew not what orders the sultan had given; but
supposed, after the account she had given him of it, he would
take care of it as a curiosity.</p>

<p id="id03686">As Firoze Shaw never doubted but that the sultan had the horse,
he communicated to the princess his design of making use of it to
convey them both into Persia; and after they had consulted
together on the measures they should take, they agreed that the
princess should dress herself the next day, and receive the
sultan civilly, but without speaking to him.</p>

<p id="id03687">The sultan of Cashmeer was overjoyed when the prince of Persia
stated to him what effect his first visit had had towards the
cure of the princess. On the following day, when the princess
received him in such a manner as persuaded him her cure was far
advanced, he regarded him as the greatest physician in the world;
and seeing her in this state, contented himself with telling her
how rejoiced he was at her being likely soon to recover her
health. He exhorted her to follow the directions of so skilful a
physician, in order to complete what he had so well begun; and
then retired without waiting for her answer.</p>

<p id="id03688">The prince of Persia, who attended the sultan of Cashmeer out of
the princess's chamber, as he accompanied him, asked if, without
failing in due respect, he might inquire, how the princess of
Bengal came into the dominions of Cashmeer thus alone, since her
own country was far distant? This he said on purpose to introduce
some conversation about the enchanted horse, and to know what was
become of it.</p>

<p id="id03689">The sultan, who could not penetrate into the prince's motive,
concealed nothing from him; but informed him of what the princess
had related, when he had delivered her from the Hindoo magician:
adding, that he had ordered the enchanted horse to be kept safe
in his treasury as a great curiosity, though he knew not the use
of it.</p>

<p id="id03690">"Sir," replied the pretended physician, "the information which
your majesty has given your devoted slave affords me a means of
curing the princess. As she was brought hither on this horse, and
the horse is enchanted, she hath contracted something of the
enchantment, which can be dissipated only by a certain incense
which I am acquainted with. If your majesty would entertain
yourself, your court, and the people of your capital, with the
most surprising sight that ever was beheld, let the horse be
brought into the great square before the palace, and leave the
rest to me. I promise to show you, and all that assembly, in a
few moments time, the princess of Bengal completely restored in
body and mind. But the better to effect what I propose, it will
be requisite that the princess, should be dressed as
magnificently as possible, and adorned with the most valuable
jewels your majesty may possess." The sultan would have
undertaken much more difficult things to have arrived at the
enjoyment of his desires, which he expected soon to accomplish.</p>

<p id="id03691">The next day, the enchanted horse was, by his order, taken out of
the treasury, and placed early in the great square before the
palace. A report was spread through the town that there was
something extraordinary to be seen, and crowds of people flocked
thither from all parts, insomuch that the sultan's guards were
placed to prevent disorder, and to keep space enough round the
horse.</p>

<p id="id03692">The sultan of Cashmeer, surrounded by all his nobles and
ministers of state, was placed on a scaffold erected on purpose.
The princess of Bengal, attended by a number of ladies whom the
sultan had assigned her, went up to the enchanted horse, and the
women helped her to mount. When she was fixed in the saddle, and
had the bridle in her hand, the pretended physician placed round
the horse at a proper distance many vessels full of lighted
charcoal, which he had ordered to be brought, and going round
them with a solemn pace, cast in a strong and grateful perfume;
then collected in himself, with downcast eyes, and his hands upon
his breast, he ran three times about the horse, making as if he
pronounced some mystical words. The moment the pots sent forth a
dark cloud of pleasant smell, which so surrounded the princess,
that neither she nor the horse could be discerned, watching his
opportunity, the prince jumped nimbly up behind her, and reaching
his hand to the peg, turned it; and just as the horse rose with
them into the air, he pronounced these words, which the sultan
heard distinctly, "Sultan of Cashmeer, when you would marry
princesses who implore your protection, learn first to obtain
their consent."</p>

<p id="id03693">Thus the prince delivered the princess of Bengal, and carried her
the same day to the capital of Persia, where he alighted in the
square of the palace, before the emperor his father's apartment,
who deferred the solemnization of the marriage no longer than
till he could make the preparations necessary to render the
ceremony pompous and magnificent, and evince the interest he took
in it.</p>

<p id="id03694">After the days appointed for the rejoicings were over, the
emperor of Persia's first care was to name and appoint an
ambassador to go to the Rajah of Bengal with an account of what
had passed, and to demand his approbation and ratification of the
alliance contracted by this marriage; which the Rajah of Bengal
took as an honour, and granted with great pleasure and
satisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="id03695" style="margin-top: 4em">            THE STORY OF PRINCE AHMED, AND THE FAIRY
                          PERIE BANOU.</h2>

<p id="id03696" style="margin-top: 3em">There was a sultan who had peaceably filled the throne of India
many years, and had the satisfaction in his old age to have three
sons the worthy imitators of his virtues, who, with the princess
his niece, were the ornaments of his court. The eldest of the
princes was called Houssain, the second Ali, the youngest Ahmed,
and the princess his niece Nouronnihar.</p>

<p id="id03697">The princess Nouronnihar was the daughter of the younger brother
of the sultan, to whom in his lifetime he had allowed a
considerable revenue. But that prince had not been married long
before he died, and left the princess very young. The sultan, in
consideration of the brotherly love and friendship that had
always subsisted between them, besides a great attachment to his
person, took upon himself the care of his daughter's education,
and brought her up in his palace with the three princes; where
her singular beauty and personal accomplishments, joined to a
lively wit and irreproachable virtue, distinguished her among all
the princesses of her time.</p>

<p id="id03698">The sultan, her uncle, proposed to marry her when she arrived at
a proper age, and by that means to contract an alliance with some
neighbouring prince; and was thinking seriously on the subject,
when he perceived that the three princes his sons loved her
passionately. This gave him much concern, though his grief did
not proceed from a consideration that their passion prevented his
forming the alliance he designed, but the difficulty he foresaw
to make them agree, and that the two youngest should consent to
yield her up to their eldest brother. He spoke to each of them
apart; and remonstrated on the impossibility of one princess
being the wife of three persons, and the troubles they would
create if they persisted in their attachment. He did all he could
to persuade them to abide by a declaration of the princess in
favour of one of them; or to desist from their pretensions, to
think of other matches which he left them free liberty to choose,
and suffer her to be married to a foreign attachment. But as he
found them obstinate, he sent for them all together, and said,
"My children, since I have not been able to dissuade you from
aspiring to marry the princess your cousin; and as I have no
inclination to use my authority, to give her to one in preference
to his brothers, I trust I have thought of an expedient which
will please you all, and preserve harmony among you, if you will
but hear me, and follow my advice. I think it would not be amiss
if you were to travel separately into different countries, so
that you might not meet each other: and as you know I am very
curious, and delight in every thing that is rare and singular, I
promise my niece in marriage to him who shall bring me the most
extraordinary rarity; chance may lead you to form your own
judgment of the singularity of the things which you bring, by the
comparison you make of them, so that you will have no difficulty
to do yourselves justice by yielding the preference to him who
has deserved it; and for the expense of travelling, I will give
each of you a sum suited to your rank, and for the purchase of
the rarity you shall search after; which shall not be laid out in
equipage and attendants, as much display, by discovering who you
are, would not only deprive you of the liberty to acquit
yourselves of your charge, but prevent your observing those
things which may merit your attention, and may be most useful to
you."</p>

<p id="id03699">As the three princes were always submissive and obedient to the
sultan's will, and each flattered himself fortune might prove
favourable to him, and give him possession of the princess
Nouronnihar, they all consented to the proposal. The sultan gave
them the money he promised; and that very day they issued orders
for the preparations for their travels, and took leave of their
father, that they might be ready to set out early next morning.
They all went out at the same gate of the city, each dressed like
a merchant, attended by a trusty officer, habited as a slave, and
all well mounted and equipped. They proceeded the first day's
journey together; and slept at a caravanserai, where the road
divided into three different tracks. At night when they were at
supper together, they all agreed to travel for a year, to make
their present lodging their rendezvous; and that the first who
came should wait for the rest; that as they had all three taken
leave together of the sultan, they might return in company. The
next morning by break of day, after they had embraced and wished
each other reciprocally good success, they mounted their horses,
and took each a different road.</p>

<p id="id03700">Prince Houssain, the eldest brother, who had heard wonders of the
extent, power, riches, and splendour of the kingdom of Bisnagar,
bent his course towards the Indian coast; and after three months'
travelling, joining himself to different caravans, sometimes over
deserts and barren mountains, and sometimes through populous and
fertile countries, arrived at Bisnagar, the capital of the
kingdom of that name, and the residence of its maharajah. He
lodged at a khan appointed for foreign merchants; and having
learnt that there were four principal divisions where merchants
of all sorts kept their shops, in the midst of which stood the
castle, or rather the maharajah's palace, on a large extent of
ground, as the centre of the city, surrounded by three courts,
and each gate distant two leagues from the other, he went to one
of these quarters the next day.</p>

<p id="id03701">Prince Houssain could not view this quarter without admiration.
It was large, divided into several streets, all vaulted and
shaded from the sun, but yet very light. The shops were all of
the same size and proportion; and all who dealt in the same sort
of goods, as well as all the artists of the same profession,
lived in one street.</p>

<p id="id03702">The number of shops stocked with all kinds of merchandizes, such
as the finest linens from several parts of India, some painted in
the most lively colours, and representing men, landscapes, trees,
and flowers; silks and brocades from Persia, China, and other
places; porcelain from Japan and China; foot carpets of all
sizes; surprised him so much, that he knew not how to believe his
eyes: but when he came to the shops of the goldsmiths and
jewellers (for those two trades were exercised by the same
merchants), he was in a kind of ecstasy, at beholding such
prodigious quantities of wrought gold and silver, and was dazzled
by the lustre of the pearls, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and
other precious stones exposed to sale. But if he was amazed at
seeing so many treasures in one place, he was much more surprised
when he came to judge of the wealth of the whole kingdom, by
considering, that except the brahmins, and ministers of the
idols, who profess a life retired from worldly vanity, there was
not an Indian, man or woman, through the extent of the kingdom,
but wore necklaces, bracelets, and ornaments about their legs and
feet, made of pearls, and precious stones, which appeared with
the greater lustre, as they were blacks, which colour admirably
set off their brilliancy.</p>

<p id="id03703">Another object which prince Houssain particularly admired was the
great number of flower-sellers who crowded the streets; for the
Indians are such great lovers of flowers that not one will stir
without a nosegay of them in his hand, or a garland of them on
his head; and the merchants keep them in pots in their shops, so
that the air of the whole quarter, however extensive, is
perfectly perfumed.</p>

<p id="id03704">After prince Houssain had passed through that quarter, street by
street, his thoughts fully employed on the riches he had seen, he
was much fatigued; which a merchant perceiving, civilly invited
him to sit down in his shop. He accepted his offer; but had not
been seated long, before he saw a crier pass with a piece of
carpeting on his arm, about six feet square, and crying it at
thirty purses. The prince called to the crier, and asked to see
the carpeting, which seemed to him to be valued at an exorbitant
price, not only for the size of it, but the meanness of the
materials. When he had examined it well, he told the crier that
he could not comprehend how so small a piece of carpeting, and of
so indifferent an appearance, could be set at so high a price.</p>

<p id="id03705">The crier, who took him for a merchant, replied, "Sir, if this
price seems so extravagant to you, your amazement will be greater
when I tell you, I have orders to raise it to forty purses, and
not to part with it under." "Certainly," answered prince
Houssain, "it must have something very extraordinary in it, which
I know nothing of." "You have guessed right, sir," replied the
crier, "and will own it when you come to know, that whoever sits
on this piece of carpeting may be transported in an instant
wherever he desires to be, without being stopped by any
obstacle."</p>

<p id="id03706">At this account, the prince of the Indies, considering that the
principal motive of his tour was to carry the sultan his father
home some singular rarity, thought that he could not meet with
any which would afford him more satisfaction. "If the carpeting,"
said he to the crier, "has the virtue you attribute to it, I
shall not think forty purses too much; but shall make you a
present besides." "Sir," replied the crier, "I have told you the
truth; and it will be an easy matter to convince you of it, as
soon as you have made the bargain for forty purses, on condition
I shew you the experiment. But as I suppose you have not so much
with you, and to receive them, I must go with you to the khan
where you lodge; with the leave of the master of this shop we
will go into the back warehouse, where I will spread the
carpeting; and when we have both sat down, and you have formed
the wish to be transported into your apartment at the khan, if we
are not conveyed thither, it shall be no bargain, and you shall
be at your liberty. As to your present, as I am paid for my
trouble by the seller, I shall receive it as a favour, and feel
much obliged by your liberality."</p>

<p id="id03707">On this assurance of the crier, the prince accepted the
conditions, and concluded the bargain; then having obtained the
master's leave, they went into his back-shop, where they both sat
down on the carpeting; and as soon as the prince had formed his
wish to be transported into his apartment at the khan, he in an
instant found himself and the crier there: as he wanted not a
more convincing proof of the virtue of the carpeting, he counted
to the crier forty purses of gold, and gave him twenty pieces for
himself.</p>

<p id="id03708">In this manner prince Houssain became the possessor of the
carpeting, and was overjoyed that at his arrival at Bisnagar he
had found so rare a curiosity, which he never doubted must of
course gain him the possession of Nouronnihar. In short, he
thought it impossible for the princes, his younger brothers, to
meet with any thing to be compared with it. It was in his power,
by sitting on this carpeting, to be at the place of rendezvous
that very day; but as he would be obliged to wait there for his
brothers, as they had agreed, and as he was desirous of seeing
the maharajah of Bisnagar and his court, and to inform himself of
the strength, laws, customs, and religion of the kingdom, he
chose to make a longer abode in this capital, and to spend some
months in satisfying his curiosity.</p>

<p id="id03709">It was the custom of the maharajah of Bisnagar to give all
foreign merchants access to his person once a week; so that in
his assumed character prince Houssain saw him often: and as this
prince was of an engaging presence, sensible and accomplished, he
distinguished himself among the merchants,  and was preferred
before them all by the maharajah, who addressed himself to him to
be informed of the person of the sultan of the Indies, and of the
government, strength, and riches of his dominions.</p>

<p id="id03710">The rest of his time the prince employed in viewing what was most
remarkable in and about the city; and among the objects which
were most worthy of admiration, he visited a temple remarkable
for being built all of brass. It was ten cubits square, and
fifteen high; but its greatest ornament was an idol of the height
of a man, of massive gold; its eyes were two rubies, set so
artificially, that it seemed to look at those who viewed it, on
which side soever they turned: besides this, there was another
not less curious, in the environs of the city, in the midst of a
lawn of about ten acres, which was like a delicious garden full
of roses and the choicest flowers, surrounded by a low wall,
breast high, to keep out the cattle. In the midst of this lawn
was raised a terrace, a man's height, and covered with such
beautiful cement, that the whole pavement seemed to be but one
single stone, most highly polished. A temple was erected in the
middle of this terrace, having a spire rising about fifty cubits
high from the building, which might be seen for several leagues
round. The temple was thirty cubits long, and twenty broad; built
of red marble, highly polished. The inside of the spire was
adorned with three compartments of fine paintings: and there was
not a part in the whole edifice but what was embellished with
paintings, or relievos, and gaudy idols from top to bottom.</p>

<p id="id03711">Every night and morning there were superstitious ceremonies
performed in this temple, which were always succeeded by sports,
concerts of music, dancing, singing, and feasts. The brahmins of
the temple, and the inhabitants of this suburb, had nothing to
subsist on but the offerings of pilgrims, who came in crowds from
the most distant parts of the kingdom to perform their vows.</p>

<p id="id03712">Prince Houssain was also spectator of a solemn festival, which
was celebrated every year at the court of Bisnagar, at which all
the governors of provinces, commanders of fortified places, all
heads and magistrates of towns, and the brahmins most celebrated
for their learning, were usually present; and some lived so far
off, that they were four months in coming. This assembly,
composed of such innumerable multitudes of Hindoos encamped in
variously coloured tents, on a plain of vast extent, was a
splendid sight, as far as the eye could reach. In the centre of
this plain was a square of great length and breadth, closed on
one side by a large scaffolding of nine stories, supported by
forty pillars, raised for the maharajah and his court, and those
strangers whom he admitted to audience once a week: within, it
was adorned and furnished magnificently with rich carpets and
cushions; and on the outside were painted landscapes, wherein all
sorts of beasts, birds, and insects, even flies and gnats, were
drawn very naturally. Other scaffolds of at least four or five
stories, and painted almost all with the same fanciful
brilliancy, formed the other three sides. But what was more
particular in these scaffolds, they could turn, and make them
change their fronts so as to present different decorations to the
eye every hour.</p>

<p id="id03713">On each side of the square, at some little distance from each
other, were ranged a thousand elephants, sumptuously caparisoned,
each having upon his back a square wooden stage, finely gilt,
upon which were musicians and buffoons. The trunks, ears, and
bodies of these elephants were painted with cinnabar and other
colours, representing grotesque figures.</p>

<p id="id03714">But what prince Houssain most of all admired, as a proof of the
industry, address, and inventive genius of the Hindoos, was to
see the largest of these elephants stand with his four feet on a
post fixed into the earth, and standing out of it above two feet,
playing and beating time with his trunk to the music. Besides
this, he admired another elephant as large as the former, placed
upon a plank, laid across a strong beam about ten feet high, with
a sufficiently heavyweight at the other end, which balanced him,
while he kept time, by the motions of his body and trunk, with
the music, as well as the other elephant. The Hindoos, after
having fastened on the counterpoise, had drawn the other end of
the board down to the ground, and made the elephant get upon it.</p>

<p id="id03715">Prince Houssain might have made a longer stay in the kingdom and
court of Bisnagar, where he would have been agreeably diverted by
a great variety of other wonders, till the last day of the year,
whereon he and his brothers had appointed to meet. But he was so
well satisfied with what he had seen, and his thoughts ran so
much upon the object of his love, that after such success in
meeting with his carpet, reflecting on the beauty and charms of
the princess Nouronnihar increased every day the violence of his
passion, and he fancied he should be the more easy and happy the
nearer he was to her. After he had satisfied the master of the
khan for his apartment, and told him the hour when he might come
for the key, without mentioning how he should travel, he shut the
door, put the key on the outside, and spreading the carpet, he
and the officer he had brought with him sat down upon it, and as
soon as he had formed his wish, were transported to the
caravanserai at which he and his brothers were to meet, and where
he passed for a merchant till their arrival.</p>

<p id="id03716">Prince Ali, the second brother, who had designed to travel into
Persia, in conformity with the intention of the sultan of the
Indies, took that road, having three days after he parted with
his brothers joined a caravan; and in four months arrived at
Sheerauz, which was then the capital of the empire of Persia; and
having in the way contracted a friendship with some merchants,
passed for a jeweller, and lodged in the same khan with them.</p>

<p id="id03717">The next morning, while the merchants opened their bales of
merchandises, prince Ali, who travelled only for his pleasure,
and had brought nothing but necessaries with him, after he had
dressed himself, took a walk into that quarter of the town where
they sold precious stones, gold and silver works, brocades,
silks, fine linens, and other choice and valuable articles, and
which was at Sheerauz called the bezestein. It was a spacious and
well-built street, arched over, within the arcades of which were
shops. Prince Ali soon rambled through the bezestein, and with
admiration judged of the riches of the place by the prodigious
quantities of the most precious merchandises exposed to view.</p>

<p id="id03718">But among the criers who passed backwards and forwards with
several sorts of goods, offering to sell them, he was not a
little surprised to see one who held in his hand an ivory tube,
of about a foot in length, and about an inch thick, which he
cried at forty purses. At first he thought the crier mad, and to
inform himself, went to a shop, and said to the merchant who
stood at the door, "Pray, sir, is not that man" (pointing to the
crier, who cried the ivory tube at forty purses) "mad? If he is
not, I am much deceived." "Indeed, sir," answered the merchant,
"he was in his right senses yesterday; and I can assure you he is
one of the ablest criers we have, and the most employed of any,
as being to be confided in when any thing valuable is to be sold;
and if he cries the ivory tube at forty purses, it must be worth
as much or more, on some account or other which does not appear.
He will come by presently, when we will call him, and you shall
satisfy yourself: in the mean time sit down on my sofa, and rest
yourself."</p>

<p id="id03719">Prince Ali accepted the merchant's obliging offer, and presently
afterwards the crier arrived. The merchant called him by his
name, and pointing to the prince, said to him, "Tell that
gentleman, who asked me if you were in your right senses, what
you mean by crying that ivory tube, which seems not to be worth
much, at forty purses? I should indeed be much amazed myself, if
I did not know you were a sensible man." The crier, addressing
himself to prince Ali, said, "Sir, you are not the only person
that takes me for a madman, on account of this tube; you shall
judge yourself whether I am or no, when I have told you its
property; and I hope you will value it at as high a price as
those I have shewed it to already, who had as bad an opinion of
me as you have.</p>

<p id="id03720">"First, sir," pursued the crier, presenting the ivory tube to the
prince, "observe, that this tube is furnished with a glass at
both ends; by looking through one of them, you will see whatever
object you wish to behold." "I am," said the prince, "ready to
make you all proper reparation for the reflection I have cast
upon you, if you can make the truth of what you advance appear;
and" (as he had the ivory tube in his hand, after he had looked
at the two glasses), he said, "shew me at which of these ends I
must look, that I may be satisfied." The crier presently shewed
him, and he looked through; wishing, at the same time, to see the
sultan his father, whom he immediately beheld in perfect health,
sitting on his throne, in the midst of his council. Next, as
there was nothing in the world so dear to him, after the sultan,
as the princess Nouronnihar, he wished to see her; and instantly
beheld her laughing, and in a gay humour, with her women about
her.</p>

<p id="id03721">Prince All wanted no other proof to persuade him that this tube
was the most valuable article, not only in the city of Sheerauz,
but in all the world; and believed, that if he should neglect to
purchase it, he should never meet with an equally wonderful
curiosity. He said to the crier, "I am very sorry that I have
entertained so erroneous an opinion of you, but hope to make
amends by buying the tube, for I should be sorry if any body else
had it; so tell me the lowest price the owner has fixed; and do
not give yourself any farther trouble to hawk it about, but go
with me and I will pay you the money." The crier assured him,
with an oath, that his last orders were to take no less than
forty purses; and if he disputed the truth of what he said, he
would carry him to his employer. The prince believed him, took
him to the khan where he lodged, told him out the money, and
received the tube.</p>

<p id="id03722">Prince Ali was overjoyed at his purchase; and persuaded himself,
that as his brothers would not be able to meet with any thing so
rare and admirable, the princess Nouronnihar must be the
recompense of his fatigue and travels. He thought now of only
visiting the court of Persia incognito, and seeing whatever was
curious in and about Sheerauz, till the caravan with which he
came might be ready to return to the Indies. He satisfied his
curiosity, and when the caravan took its departure, the prince
joined the former party of merchants his friends, and arrived
happily without any accident or trouble, further than the length
of the journey and fatigue of travelling, at the place of
rendezvous, where he found prince Houssain, and both waited for
prince Ahmed.</p>

<p id="id03723">Prince Ahmed took the road of Samarcand, and the day after his
arrival, went, as his brothers had done, into the bezestein;
where he had not walked long before he heard a crier, who had an
artificial apple in his hand, cry it at five-and-thirty purses.
He stopped the crier, and said to him, "Let me see that apple,
and tell me what virtue or extraordinary property it possesses,
to be valued at so high a rate?" "Sir," replied the crier, giving
it into his hand, "if you look at the mere outside of this apple
it is not very remarkable; but if you consider its properties,
and the great use and benefit it is of to mankind, you will say
it is invaluable, and that he who possesses it is master of a
great treasure. It cures all sick persons of the most mortal
diseases, whether fever, pleurisy, plague, or other malignant
distempers; for even if the patient is dying, it will recover him
immediately, and restore him to perfect health: and this merely
by the patient's smelling to it."</p>

<p id="id03724">"If one may believe you," replied prince Ahmed, "the virtues of
this apple are wonderful, and it is indeed invaluable: but what
ground has the purchaser to be persuaded that there is no
exaggeration in the high praises you bestow on it?" "Sir,"
replied the crier, "the truth is known by the whole city of
Samarcand; but without going any farther, ask all these merchants
you see here, and hear what they say; you will find several of
them will tell you they had not been alive this day had they not
made use of this excellent remedy; and that you may the better
comprehend what it is, I must tell you it is the fruit of the
study and experience of a celebrated philosopher of this city,
who applied himself all his lifetime to the knowledge of the
virtues of plants and minerals, and at last attained to this
composition, by which he performed such surprising cures, as will
never be forgotten; but died suddenly himself, before he could
apply his own sovereign remedy; and left his wife and a great
many young children behind in very indifferent circumstances,
who, to support her family, and to provide for her children, has
resolved to sell it."</p>

<p id="id03725">While the crier was detailing to prince Ahmed the virtues of the
artificial apple, many persons came about them, and confirmed
what he declared; and one amongst the rest said he had a friend
dangerously ill, whose life was despaired of; which was a
favourable opportunity to shew the experiment. Upon which prince
Ahmed told the crier he would give him forty purses for the apple
if it cured the sick person by smelling to it.</p>

<p id="id03726">The crier, who had orders to sell it at that price, said to
prince Ahmed, "Come, sir, let us go and make the experiment, and
the apple shall be yours; and I say this with the greater
confidence, as it is an undoubted fact that it will always have
the same effect, as it already has had whenever it has been
applied to save from death so many persons whose lives were
despaired of." In short, the experiment succeeded; and the
prince, after he had counted out to the crier forty purses, and
had received the apple from him, waited with the greatest
impatience for the departure of a caravan for the Indies. In the
mean time he saw all that was curious at and about Samarcand, and
principally the valley of Sogd, which is reckoned by the Arabians
one of the four paradises of this world, for the beauty of its
fields, gardens, and palaces, and for its fertility in fruit of
all sorts, and all the other pleasures enjoyed there in the fine
season.</p>

<p id="id03727">Ahmed joined himself to the first caravan that set out for the
Indies, and notwithstanding the inevitable inconveniences of so
long a journey, arrived in perfect health at the caravanserai,
where the princes Houssain and Ali waited for him.</p>

<p id="id03728">Ali, who had arrived some time before Ahmed, asked Houssain how
long he had been there? who told him, "Three months;" to which he
replied, "Then certainly you have not been very far." "I will
tell you nothing now," said prince Houssain, "of where I have
been, but only assure you, I was above three months travelling to
the place I went to." "But then," replied prince Ali, "you made a
short stay there." "Indeed, brother," said prince Houssain, "you
are mistaken; I resided at one place above four months, and might
have stayed longer." "Unless you flew back," returned Ali again,
"I cannot comprehend how you can have been three months here, as
you would make me believe."</p>

<p id="id03729">"I tell you the truth," added Houssain, "and it is a riddle which
I shall not explain to you, till our brother Ahmed joins us; when
I will let you know what rarity I have purchased in my travels. I
know not what you have got, but believe it to be some trifle,
because I do not perceive that your baggage is increased." "And
pray what have you brought?" demanded prince Ali, "for I can see
nothing but an ordinary piece of carpeting, with which you cover
your sofa; and therefore I think I may return your raillery; and
as you seem to make what you have brought a secret, you cannot
take it amiss that I do the same with respect to what I have
procured."</p>

<p id="id03730">"I consider the rarity I have purchased," replied Houssain, "to
excel all others whatever, and should not make any difficulty to
shew it you, and make you allow that it is so, and at the same
time tell you how I came by it, without being in the least
apprehensive that what you have got is to be preferred to it: but
it is proper that we should wait till our brother Ahmed arrives,
when we may communicate our good fortune to each other."</p>

<p id="id03731">Prince All would not enter into a dispute with prince Houssain on
the preference he gave his rarity, but was persuaded, that if his
perspective glass was not preferable, it was impossible it should
be inferior to it; and therefore agreed to stay till prince Ahmed
arrived, to produce his purchase.</p>

<p id="id03732">When prince Ahmed joined his brothers, they embraced with
tenderness, and complimented each other on the happiness of
meeting together at the same place they had set out from.
Houssain, as the eldest brother, then assumed the discourse, and
said to them, "Brothers, we shall have time enough hereafter to
entertain ourselves with the particulars of our travels. Let us
come to that which is of the greatest importance for us to know;
and as I do not doubt you remember the principal motive which
engaged us to travel, let us not conceal from each other the
curiosities we have brought, but shew them, that we may do
ourselves justice beforehand, and judge to which of us the sultan
our father may give the preference.</p>

<p id="id03733">"To set the example," continued Houssain, "I will tell you, that
the rarity which I have brought from the kingdom of Bisnagar is
the carpeting on which I sit, which looks but ordinary, and makes
no shew; but when I have declared its virtues, you will be struck
with admiration, and confess you never heard of any thing like
it. Whoever sits on it, as we do, and desires to be transported
to any place, be it ever so far distant, he is immediately
carried thither. I made the experiment myself, before I paid the
forty purses, which I most readily gave for it; and when I had
fully satisfied my curiosity at the court of Bisnagar, and wished
to return here, I made use of no other conveyance than this
wonderful carpet for myself and servant, who can tell you how
long we were on our journey. I will shew you both the experiment
whenever you please. I expect now that you should tell me whether
what you have brought is to be compared with this carpet."</p>

<p id="id03734">Here prince Houssain finished his commendations of the excellency
of his carpet; and prince Ali, addressing himself to him, said,
"I must own, brother, that your carpet is one of the most
surprising curiosities, if it has, as I do not doubt, the
property you speak of. But you must allow that there may be other
rarities, I will not say more, but at least as wonderful, in
another way; and to convince you there are, here is an ivory
tube, which appears to the eye no more a prodigy than your
carpet; it cost me as much, and I am as well satisfied with my
purchase as you can be with yours; and you will be so just as to
own that I have not been imposed upon, when you shall know by
experience, that by looking at one end you see whatever object
you wish to behold. I would not have you take my word," added
prince Ali, presenting the tube to him; "take it, make trial of
it yourself."</p>

<p id="id03735">Houssain took the ivory tube from prince Ali, and put that end to
his eye which Ali directed, with an intention to see the princess
Nouronnihar; when Ali and prince Ahmed, who kept their eyes fixed
upon him, were extremely surprised to see his countenance change
in such a manner, as expressed extraordinary alarm and
affliction. Prince Houssain did not give them time to ask what
was the matter, but cried out, "Alas! princes, to what purpose
have we undertaken such long and fatiguing journeys, but with the
hopes of being recompensed by the possession of the charming
Nouronnihar, when in a few moments that lovely princess will
breathe her last. I saw her in her bed, surrounded by her women
and eunuchs, all in tears, who seem to expect her death. Take the
tube, behold yourselves the miserable state she is in, and mingle
your tears with mine."</p>

<p id="id03736">Prince Ali took the tube out of Houssain's hand, and after he had
seen the same object with sensible grief, presented it to Ahmed,
who took it, to behold the melancholy sight which so much
concerned them all.</p>

<p id="id03737">When prince Ahmed had taken the tube out of Ali's hands, and saw
that the princess Nouronnihar's end was so near, he addressed
himself to his two brothers, and said, "Princes, the princess
Nouronnihar, equally the object of our vows, is indeed just at
death's door; but provided we make haste and lose no time, we may
preserve her life." He then took the artificial apple out of his
bosom, and shewing it to his brothers, resumed, "This apple cost
me as much and more than either the carpet or tube. The
opportunity which now presents itself to shew you its wonderful
property makes me not regret the forty purses I gave for it. But
not to keep you longer in suspense, it has this virtue; if a sick
person smells to it, though in the last agonies, it will restore
him to perfect health immediately. I have made the experiment,
and can show you its wonderful effect on the person of the
princess Nouronnihar, if we hasten to assist her."</p>

<p id="id03738">"If that be all," replied prince Houssain, "we cannot make more
dispatch than by transporting ourselves instantly into her
chamber by means of my carpet. Come, lose no time, sit down, it
is large enough to hold us all: but first let us give orders to
our servants to set out immediately, and join us at the palace."</p>

<p id="id03739">As soon as the order was given, the princes Ali and Ahmed sat
down by Houssain, and as their interest was the same, they all
framed the same wish, and were transported instantaneously into
the princess Nouronnihar's chamber.</p>

<p id="id03740">The presence of the three princes, who were so little expected,
alarmed the princess's women and eunuchs, who could not
comprehend by what enchantment three men should be among them;
for they did not know them at first; and the eunuchs were ready
to fall upon them, as people who had got into a part of the
palace where they were not allowed to come; but they presently
found their mistake.</p>

<p id="id03741">Prince Ahmed no sooner saw himself in Nouronnihar's chamber, and
perceived the princess dying, but he rose off the carpet, as did
also the other two princes, went to the bed-side, and put the
apple to her nostrils. The princess instantly opened her eyes,
and turned her head from one side to another, looking at the
persons who stood about her; she then rose up in the bed, and
asked to be dressed, with the same freedom and recollection as if
she had awaked out of a sound sleep. Her women presently informed
her, in a manner that shewed their joy, that she was obliged to
the three princes her cousins, and particularly to prince Ahmed,
for the sudden recovery of her health. She immediately expressed
her joy at seeing them, and thanked them all together, but
afterwards prince Ahmed in particular. As she desired to dress,
the princes contented themselves with telling her how great a
pleasure it was to them to have come soon enough to contribute
each in any degree towards relieving her from the imminent danger
she was in, and what ardent prayers they had offered for the
continuance of her life; after which they retired.</p>

<p id="id03742">While the princess was dressing, the princes went to throw
themselves at the sultan their father's feet; but when they came
to him, they found he had been previously informed of their
unexpected arrival by the chief of the princess's eunuchs, and by
what means the princess had been so suddenly cured. The sultan
received and embraced them with the greatest joy, both for their
return, and the wonderful recovery of the princess his niece,
whom he loved as if she had been his own daughter, and who had
been given over by the physicians. After the usual compliments,
the princes presented each the rarity which he had brought:
prince Houssain his carpet, prince Ali his ivory tube, and prince
Ahmed the artificial apple; and after each had commended his
present, as he put it into the sultan's hands, they begged of him
to pronounce their fate, and declare to which of them he would
give the princess Nouronnihar, according to his promise.</p>

<p id="id03743">The sultan of the Indies having kindly heard all that the princes
had to say in favour of their rarities, without interrupting
them, and being well informed of what had happened in relation to
the princess Nouronnihar's cure, remained some time silent,
considering what answer he should make. At last he broke silence,
and said to them in terms full of wisdom, "I would declare for
one of you, my children, if I could do it with justice; but
consider whether I can? It is true, Ahmed, the princess my niece
is obliged to your artificial apple for her cure: but let me ask
you, whether you could have been so serviceable to her if you had
not known by Ali's tube the danger she was in, and if Houssain's
carpet had not brought you to her so soon? Your tube, Ali,
informed you and your brothers that you were likely to lose the
princess your cousin, and so far she is greatly obliged to you.
You must also grant, that the knowledge of her illness would have
been of no service without the artificial apple and the carpet.
And as for you, Houssain, the princess would be very ungrateful
if she did not show her sense of the value of your carpet, which
was so necessary a means towards effecting her cure. But
consider, it would have been of little use, if you had not been
acquainted with her illness by Ali's tube, or if Ahmed had not
applied his artificial apple. Therefore, as neither the carpet,
the ivory tube, nor the artificial apple has the least preference
to the other articles, but as, on the contrary, their value has
been perfectly equal, I cannot grant the princess to any one of
you; and the only fruit you have reaped from your travels is the
glory of having equally contributed to restore her to health.</p>

<p id="id03744">"As this is the case," added the sultan, "you see that I must
have recourse to other means to determine me with certainty in
the choice I ought to make; and as there is time enough between
this and night, I will do it to-day. Go and procure each of you a
bow and arrow, repair to the plain where the horses are
exercised; I will soon join you, and will give the princess
Nouronnihar to him who shoots the farthest.</p>

<p id="id03745">"I do not, however, forget to thank you all in general, and each
in particular, for the present you have brought me. I have many
rarities in my collection already, but nothing that comes up to
the miraculous properties of the carpet, the ivory tube, and the
artificial apple, which shall have the first places among them,
and shall be preserved carefully, not only for curiosity, but for
service upon all proper occasions."</p>

<p id="id03746">The three princes had nothing to object to the decision of the
sultan. When they were dismissed his presence, they each provided
themselves with a bow and arrow, which they delivered to one of
their officers, and went to the plain appointed, followed by a
great concourse of people.</p>

<p id="id03747">The sultan did not make them wait long for him: as soon as he
arrived, prince Houssain, as the eldest, took his bow and arrow,
and shot first. Prince Ali shot next, and much beyond him; and
prince Ahmed last of all; but it so happened, that nobody could
see where his arrow fell; and notwithstanding all the search made
by himself and all the spectators, it was not to be found. Though
it was believed that he had shot the farthest, and had therefore
deserved the princess Nouronnihar, it was however necessary that
his arrow should be found, to make the matter more evident and
certain; but notwithstanding his remonstrances, the sultan
determined in favour of prince Ali, and gave orders for
preparations to be made for the solemnization of the nuptials,
which were celebrated a few days after with great magnificence.</p>

<p id="id03748">Prince Houssain would not honour the feast with his presence; his
passion for the princess Nouronnihar was so sincere and ardent,
that he could scarcely support with patience the mortification of
seeing her in the arms of prince Ali: who, he said, did not
deserve her better nor love her more than himself. In short, his
grief was so violent and insupportable, that he left the court,
and renounced all right of succession to the crown, to turn
dervish, and put himself under the discipline of a famous chief,
who had gained great reputation for his exemplary life; and had
taken up his abode, and that of his disciples, whose number was
great, in an agreeable solitude.</p>

<p id="id03749">Prince Ahmed, urged by the same motive, did not assist at prince
Ali and the princess Nouronnihar's nuptials, any more than his
brother Houssain, yet did not renounce the world as he had done.
But as he could not imagine what could have become of his arrow,
he resolved to search for it, that he might not have any thing to
reproach himself with. With this intent he went to the place
where the princes Houssain's and Ali's were gathered up, and
proceeding straight forwards from thence looked carefully on both
sides as he advanced. He went so far, that at last he began to
think his labour was in vain; yet he could not help proceeding
till he came to some steep craggy rocks, which would have obliged
him to return, had he been ever so desirous to continue his
course.</p>

<p id="id03750">As he approached these rocks, he perceived an arrow, which he
took up, looked earnestly at it, and was in the greatest
astonishment to find it was the same he had shot. "Certainly,"
said he to himself, "neither I, nor any man living, could shoot
an arrow so far; and finding it laid flat, not sticking into the
ground, he judged that it had rebounded from the rock. There must
be some mystery in this, said he to himself again, and it may be
to my advantage. Perhaps fortune, to make amends for depriving me
of what I thought the greatest happiness of my life, may have
reserved a greater blessing for my comfort."</p>

<p id="id03751">As these rocks were full of sharp points and indentures between
them, the prince meditating, entered into one of the cavities,
and looking about, beheld an iron door, which seemed to have no
lock. He feared it was fastened; but pushing against it, it
opened, and discovered an easy descent, which he walked down with
his arrow in his hand. At first he thought he was going into a
dark place, but presently a light quite different from that which
he had quitted succeeded; and entering into a spacious square,
he, to his surprise, beheld a magnificent palace, the admirable
structure of which he had not time to look at: for at the same
instant, a lady of majestic air, and of a beauty to which the
richness of her habit and the jewels which adorned her person
added no advantage, advanced, attended by a troop of ladies, or
whom it was difficult to distinguish which was the mistress, as
all were so magnificently dressed.</p>

<p id="id03752">As soon as Ahmed perceived the lady, he hastened to pay his
respects; and the lady seeing him coming, prevented him.
Addressing him first, she said, "Come near, prince Ahmed, you are
welcome."</p>

<p id="id03753">It was with no small surprise that the prince heard himself named
in a palace he had never heard of, though so nigh to his father's
capital, and he could not comprehend how he should be known to a
lady who was a stranger to him. At last he returned the lady's
compliment, by throwing himself at her feet, and rising up, said
to her, "Lady, I return you a thousand thanks for the assurance
you give me of welcome to a place where I had reason to believe
my imprudent curiosity had made me penetrate too far. But may I,
without being guilty of rudeness, presume to inquire by what
adventure you know me? and how you who live in the same
neighbourhood should be so little known by me?" "Prince," said
the lady, "let us go into the hall; there I will gratify you in
your request more commodiously for us both."</p>

<p id="id03754">After these words, the lady led prince Ahmed into the hall, the
noble structure of which, displaying the gold and azure which
embellished the dome, and the inestimable richness of the
furniture, appeared so great a novelty to him, that he could not
forbear his admiration, but exclaimed, that he had never beheld
its equal. "I can assure you," replied the lady, "that this is
but a small part of my palace, as you will judge when you have
seen all the apartments." She then sat down on a sofa; and when
the prince at her entreaty had seated himself by her, she
continued, "You are surprised, you say, that I know you, and am
not known by you; but you will be no longer surprised when I
inform you who I am. You cannot be ignorant, as the Koran informs
you, that the world is inhabited by genii as well as men: I am
the daughter of one of the most powerful and distinguished of
these genii, and my name is Perie Banou; therefore you ought not
to wonder that I know you, the sultan your father, the princes
your brothers, and the princess Nouronnihar. I am no stranger to
your loves or your travels, of which I could tell you all the
circumstances, since it was I myself who exposed to sale the
artificial apple which you bought at Samarcand, the carpet which
prince Houssain purchased at Bisnagar, and the tube which prince
Ali brought from Sheerauz. This is sufficient to let you know
that I am not unacquainted with every thing that relates to you.
I have to add, that you seemed to me worthy of a more happy fate
than that of possessing the princess Nouronnihar; and that you
might attain to it, I was present when you drew your arrow, and
foresaw it would not go beyond prince Houssain's. I seized it in
the air, and gave it the necessary motion to strike against the
rocks near which you found it. It is in your power to avail
yourself of the favourable opportunity which presents itself to
make you happy."</p>

<p id="id03755">As the fairy Perie Banou pronounced the last words with a
different tone, and looked at the same time tenderly at the
prince, with downcast eyes and a modest blush upon her cheeks, it
was not difficult for him to comprehend what happiness she meant.
He reflected that the princess Nouronnihar could never be his,
saw that Perie Banou excelled her infinitely in beauty and
accomplishments, and, as far as he could conjecture by the
magnificence of the palace, in immense riches. He blessed the
moment that he thought of seeking after his arrow a second time,
and yielding to his inclination, which drew him towards the new
object which had fired his heart: he then replied, "Should I, all
my life, have the happiness of being your slave, and the admirer
of the many charms which ravish my soul, I should think myself
the happiest of men. Pardon the presumption which inspires me to
ask this favour, and do not refuse to admit into your court a
prince who is entirely devoted to you."</p>

<p id="id03756">"Prince," answered the fairy, "as I have been, long my own
mistress, and have no dependence on a parent's consent, it is not
as a slave that I would admit you into my court, but as master of
my person, and all that belongs to me, by pledging your faith to
me, and taking me as your wife. I hope you will not think it
indecorous, that I anticipate you in this proposal. I am, as I
said, mistress of my will; and must add, that the same customs
are not observed among fairies as with human-kind, in whom it
would not have been decent to have made such advances: but it is
what we do, and we suppose we confer obligation by the practice."</p>

<p id="id03757">Ahmed made no answer to this declaration, but was so penetrated
with gratitude, that he thought he could not express it better
than by prostration to kiss the hem of her garment; which she
would not give him time to do, but presented her hand, which he
kissed a thousand times, and kept fast locked in his. "Well,
prince Ahmed," said she, "will you pledge your faith to me, as I
do mine to you?" "Yes, madam," replied the prince, in an ecstacy
of joy. "What can I do more fortunate for myself, or with greater
pleasure? Yes, my sultaness, I give it you with my heart without
the least reserve." "Then," answered the fairy, "you are my
husband, and I am your wife. Our fairy marriages are contracted
with no other ceremonies, and yet are more firm and indissoluble
than those among men, with all their formalities. But as I
suppose," pursued she, "that you have eaten nothing to-day, a
slight repast shall be served up for you while preparations are
making for our nuptial feast this evening, and then I will shew
you the apartments of my palace."</p>

<p id="id03758">Some of the fairy's women who came into the hall with them, and
guessed her intentions, went immediately out, and returned with
some excellent viands and wines.</p>

<p id="id03759">When Ahmed had refreshed himself, the fairy led him through all
the apartments, where he saw diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and all
sorts of fine jewels, intermixed with pearls, agate, jasper,
porphyry, and all kinds of the most precious marbles; not to
mention the richness of the furniture, which was inestimable; the
whole disposed in such elegant profusion, that the prince
acknowledged there could not be any thing in the world equal to
it. "Prince," said the fairy, "if you admire my humble abode so
much, what would you say to the palaces of the chiefs of our
genii, which are much more beautiful, spacious, and magnificent?
I could also shew you my garden; but we will leave that till
another time. Night draws near, and it will be time to go to
supper."</p>

<p id="id03760">The next hall which the fairy led the prince into, where the
cloth was laid for the feast, was the only apartment he had not
seen, and it was not in the least inferior to the others. At his
entrance, he admired the infinite number of wax candles perfumed
with amber, the multitude of which, instead of being confused,
were placed with so just a symmetry, as to form an agreeable and
pleasant light. A large beaufet was set out with all sorts of
gold plate, so finely wrought, that the workmanship was much more
valuable than the weight of the gold. Several bands of beautiful
women richly dressed, and whose voices were ravishing, began a
concert, accompanied by the most harmonious instruments he had
ever heard. When they were seated, the fairy took care to help
prince Ahmed to the most delicious meats, which she named as she
invited him to eat of them, and which the prince had never heard
of, but found so exquisite, that he commended them in the highest
terms, saying, that the entertainment which she gave him far
surpassed those among men. He found also the same excellence in
the wines, which neither he nor the fairy tasted till the dessert
was served up, which consisted of the choicest sweetmeats and
fruits.</p>

<p id="id03761">After the dessert, the fairy Perie Banou and prince Ahmed rose
and repaired to a sofa, with cushions of fine silk, curiously
embroidered with all sorts of large flowers, laid at their backs.
Presently after a great number of genii and fairies danced before
them to the chamber where the nuptial bed was prepared; and when
they came to the entrance, divided themselves into two rows, to
let them pass, after which they made obeisance and retired.</p>

<p id="id03762">The nuptial festivity was renewed the next day; or rather, every
day following the celebration was a continued feast, which the
fairy Perie Banou knew how to diversify, by new delicacies, new
concerts, new dances, new shows, and new diversions; which were
all so gratifying to his senses, that Ahmed, if he had lived a
thousand years among men, could not have experienced equal
enjoyment.</p>

<p id="id03763">The fairy's intention was not only to give the prince convincing
proofs of the sincerity of her love, by so many attentions; but
to let him see, that as he had no pretensions at his father's
court, he could meet with nothing comparable to the happiness he
enjoyed with her, independently of her beauty and attractions,
and to attach him entirely to herself. In this attempt she
succeeded so well, that Ahmed's passion was not in the least
diminished by possession; but increased so much, that if he had
been so inclined, it was not in his power to forbear loving her.</p>

<p id="id03764">At the end of six months, prince Ahmed, who always loved and
honoured the sultan his father, felt a great desire to know how
he was; and as that desire could not be satisfied without his
absenting himself, he mentioned his wish to the fairy, and
requested she would give him leave to visit the sultan.</p>

<p id="id03765">This request alarmed the fairy, and made her fear it was only an
excuse to leave her. She said to him, "What disgust can I have
given to you to ask me this permission? Is it possible you should
have forgotten that you have pledged your faith to me, or have
you ceased to love one who is so passionately fond of you? Are
not the proofs I have repeatedly given you of my affection
sufficient?"</p>

<p id="id03766">"My queen," replied the prince, "I am perfectly convinced of your
love, and should be unworthy of it, if I did not testify my
gratitude by a reciprocal affection. If you are offended at the
permission I solicit, I entreat you to forgive me, and I will
make all the reparation in my power. I did not make the request
with any intention of displeasing you, but from a motive of
respect towards my father, whom I wish to free from the
affliction in which my so long absence must have overwhelmed him,
and which must be the greater, as, I have reason to presume, he
believes that I am dead. But since you do not consent that I
should go and afford him that comfort, I will deny myself the
pleasure, as there is nothing to which I would not submit to
please you."</p>

<p id="id03767">Ahmed did not dissemble, for he loved her at heart as much as he
had assured her by this declaration; and the fairy expressed her
satisfaction. But as he could not absolutely abandon his design,
he frequently took an opportunity to speak to her of the great
qualifications of the sultan his father: and above all, of his
particular tenderness towards himself, in hopes he might at
length be able to move her.</p>

<p id="id03768">As the prince had supposed, the sultan of the Indies, in the
midst of the rejoicings on account of the nuptials of prince Ali
and the princess Nouronnihar, was sensibly afflicted at the
absence of the other two princes his sons, though it was not long
before he was informed of the resolution Houssain had taken to
forsake the world, and the place he had chosen for his retreat.
As a good father, whose happiness consists in seeing his children
about him, especially when they are deserving of his tenderness,
he would have been better pleased had he stayed at his court,
near his person; but as he could not disapprove of his choice of
the state of perfection which he had entered, he supported his
absence more patiently. He made the most diligent search after
Ahmed, and dispatched couriers to all the provinces of his
dominions, with orders to the governors to stop him, and oblige
him to return to court: but all the pains he took had not the
desired success, and his affliction, instead of diminishing,
increased. He would make it the subject of his conversation with
his grand vizier; and would say to him, "Vizier, thou knowest I
always loved Ahmed the most of all my sons; and thou art not
insensible of the means I have in vain used to find him out. My
grief is so heavy, I shall sink under it, if thou hast not
compassion on me; if thou hast any regard for the preservation of
my life, I conjure thee to assist and advise me."</p>

<p id="id03769">The grand vizier, no less attached to the person of the sultan
than zealous to acquit himself well of the administration of the
affairs of state, considering how to give his sovereign some
ease, recollected a sorceress, of whom he had heard wonders, and
proposed to send for and consult her. The sultan consented, and
the grand vizier, upon her arrival, introduced her into the
presence.</p>

<p id="id03770">The sultan said to the sorceress, "The affliction I have been in
since the marriage of my son prince Ali to the princess
Nouronnihar, my niece, on account of the absence of prince Ahmed,
is so well known, and so public, that thou canst be no stranger
to it. By thy art and skill canst thou tell me what is become of
him? If he be alive, where he is? what he is doing? and if I may
hope ever to see him again?" To this the sorceress replied, "It
is impossible, sir, for me, however skilful in my profession, to
answer immediately the questions your majesty asks; but if you
allow me till to-morrow, I will endeavour to satisfy you." The
sultan granted her the time, and permitted her to retire, with a
promise to recompense her munificently, if her answer proved
agreeable to his hopes.</p>

<p id="id03771">The sorceress returned the next day, and the grand vizier
presented her a second time to the sultan. "Sir," said she,
"notwithstanding all the diligence I have used in applying the
rules of my art to obey your majesty in what you desire to know,
I have not been able to discover any thing more than that prince
Ahmed is alive. This is certain, and you may depend upon it; but
as to where he is I cannot discover."</p>

<p id="id03772">The sultan of the Indies was obliged to remain satisfied with
this answer; which left him in the same uneasiness as before as
to the prince's situation.</p>

<p id="id03773">To return to prince Ahmed. He so often entertained the fairy
Perie Banou with talking about his father, though without
speaking any more of his desire to visit him, that she fully
comprehended what he meant; and perceiving the restraint he put
upon himself, and his fear of displeasing her after her first
refusal, she inferred, from the repeated proofs he had given her,
that his love for her was sincere; and judging by herself of the
injustice she committed in opposing a son's tenderness for his
father, and endeavouring to make him renounce that natural
affection, she resolved to grant him the permission which she knew
he so ardently desired. One day she said to him, "Prince, the
request you made to be allowed to go and see the sultan your
father gave me apprehension that it was only a pretext to conceal
inconstancy, and that was the sole motive of my refusal; but now,
as I am fully convinced by your actions and words that I can
depend on your honour and the fidelity of your love, I change my
resolution, and grant you the permission you seek, on condition
that you will first swear to me that your absence shall not be
long. You ought not to be uneasy at this condition, as if I asked
it out of distrust. I impose it only because I know that it will
give you no concern, convinced, as I have already told you I am,
of the sincerity of your love."</p>

<p id="id03774">Prince Ahmed would have thrown himself at the fairy's feet to
shew his gratitude, but she prevented him. "My sultaness," said
he, "I am sensible of the great favour you grant me; but want
words to express my thanks. Supply this defect, I conjure you, by
your own feelings, and be persuaded I think much more. You may
believe that the oath will give me no uneasiness, and I take it
more willingly, since it is not possible for me to live without
you. I go, but the haste I will make to return shall shew you,
that it is not the fear of being foresworn, but my inclination,
which is to live with you for ever, that urges me; and if with
your consent I now and then deprive myself of your society, I
shall always avoid the pain a too long absence would occasion
me."</p>

<p id="id03775">"Prince," replied Perie Banou, delighted with his sentiments, "go
when you please; but do not take it amiss that I give you some
advice how you shall conduct yourself. First, I do not think it
proper for you to inform your father of our marriage, neither of
my quality, nor the place of our residence. Beg of him to be
satisfied with knowing that you are happy, that you want nothing
from him, and let him know that the sole end of your visit is to
make him easy respecting your fate."</p>

<p id="id03776">Perie Banou then appointed twenty horsemen, well mounted and
equipped, to attend him. When all was ready, prince Ahmed took
his leave of the fairy, embraced her, and renewed his promise to
return soon. A charger, which was most richly caparisoned, and as
beautiful a creature as any in the sultan of the Indies' stables,
was brought to him, which he mounted with extraordinary grace,
which gave great pleasure to the fairy; and after he had bidden
her adieu, he set forward on his journey.</p>

<p id="id03777">As it was no great distance to his father's capital, prince Ahmed
soon arrived there. The people, rejoiced to see him again,
received him with acclamations, and followed him in crowds to the
palace. The sultan received and embraced him with great joy;
complaining at the same time, with a fatherly tenderness, of the
affliction his long absence had occasioned; which, he said, was
the more distressing, as fortune having decided in favour of
prince Ali his brother, he was afraid he might have committed
some act of despair.</p>

<p id="id03778">"Sir," replied prince Ahmed, "I leave it to your majesty to
consider, if after having lost the princess Nouronnihar, who was
the only object of my desires, I could bear to be a witness of
Ali's happiness. If I had been capable of such unworthy apathy,
what would the court and city have thought of my love, or what
your majesty? Love is a passion we cannot suppress at our will;
while it lasts, it rules and governs us in spite of our boasted
reason. Your majesty knows, that when I shot my arrow, the most
extraordinary accident that ever befell mortal happened to me,
for surely it was such, that in so large and level a plain as
that where the horses are exercised, it should not be possible to
find my arrow. I lost your decision in my favour, which was as
much due to my love, as to that of the princes my brothers.
Though thus vanquished by the caprice of fate, I lost no time in
vain complaints; but to satisfy my perplexed mind, upon what I
could not comprehend, I left my attendants, and returned alone to
look for my arrow. I sought all about the place where Houssain's
and Ali's arrows were found, and where I imagined mine must have
fallen, but all my labour was in vain. I was not discouraged, but
continued my search in a direct line, and after this manner had
gone above a league, without being able to meet with any thing
like an arrow, when I reflected that it was not possible that
mine should have flown so far. I stopped, and asked myself
whether I was in my right senses, to flatter myself with having
had strength to shoot an arrow so much farther than any of the
strongest archers in the world were able to do. After I had
argued thus with myself, I was ready to abandon my enterprise;
but when on the point of putting my resolution in execution, I
found myself drawn forward against my will; and after having gone
four leagues, to that part of the plain where it is bounded by
rocks, I perceived an arrow. I ran, took it up, and knew it to be
the same which I had shot. Far from thinking your majesty had
done me any injustice in declaring for my brother Ali, I
interpreted what had happened to me quite otherwise, and never
doubted there was a mystery in it to my advantage; the discovery
of which I ought not to neglect, and which I found out without
going from the spot. But as to this mystery I beg your majesty
will not be offended if I remain silent, and that you will be
satisfied to know from my own mouth that I am happy, and content
with my fate.</p>

<p id="id03779">"In the midst of my happiness, the only thing that troubled me,
or was capable of disturbing me, was the uneasiness I feared your
majesty would experience on account of my leaving the court, and
your not knowing what was become of me. I thought it my duty to
satisfy you in this point. This was the only motive which brought
me hither; the only favour I ask of your majesty is to give me
leave to come occasionally to pay you my duty, and inquire after
your health."</p>

<p id="id03780">"Son," answered the sultan of the Indies, "I cannot refuse you
the permission you ask, but I should much rather you would
resolve to stay with me. At least tell me where I may hear of
you, if you should fail to come, or when I may think your
presence necessary." "Sir," replied the prince, "what your
majesty requires is part of the mystery I spoke of. I beg of you
to allow me to remain silent on this head; for I shall come so
frequently where my duty calls, that I am afraid I shall sooner
be thought troublesome than be accused of negligence, when my
presence may be necessary."</p>

<p id="id03781">The sultan of the Indies pressed Ahmed no more, but said to him,
"Son, I wish to penetrate no farther into your secrets, but leave
you at your liberty. I can only tell you, that you could not have
done me greater pleasure than by your presence, having restored
to me the joy I have not felt for a long time; and that you shall
always be welcome when you can come, without interrupting your
business or your pleasure."</p>

<p id="id03782">Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at his father's court, and on
the fourth returned to the fairy Perie Banou, who received him
with the greater joy, as she did not expect him so soon. His
expedition made her condemn herself for suspecting his want of
fidelity. She never dissembled, but frankly owned her weakness to
the prince, and asked his pardon. So perfect was the union of the
two lovers, that they had but one will.</p>

<p id="id03783">A month after prince Ahmed's return from visiting his father, as
the fairy had observed that since the time when he gave her an
account of his journey, and his conversation with his father, in
which he asked his permission to come and see him from time to
time, he had never spoken of the sultan, whereas before he was
frequently mentioning him, she thought he forebore on her
account, and therefore took an opportunity to say to him one day,
"Tell me, prince, have you forgotten the sultan your father? Do
not you remember the promise you made to pay your duty to him
occasionally? I have not forgotten what you told me at your
return, and put you in mind of it, that you may acquit yourself
of your promise when you may feel inclined."</p>

<p id="id03784">"Madam," replied Ahmed, with equal animation, "as I know I am not
guilty of the forgetfulness you lay to my charge, I rather choose to
be thus reproached, however undeservedly, than expose myself to a
refusal, by manifesting a desire for what it might have given you pain
to grant." "Prince," said the fairy, "I would not have you in this
affair have so much consideration for me, since it is a month since
you have seen the sultan your father. I think you should not be longer
in renewing your visits. Pay him one to-morrow, and after that, go and
visit once a month, without speaking to me, or waiting for my
permission. I readily consent to such an arrangement."</p>

<p id="id03785">Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendants as
before, but much more magnificently mounted, equipped, and
dressed, and was received by the sultan with the same joy and
satisfaction. For several months he constantly paid him visits,
and always in a richer and more brilliant equipage.</p>

<p id="id03786">At last the sultan's favourites, who judged of prince Ahmed's
power by the splendour of his appearance, abused the privilege
the sultan accorded them of speaking to him with freedom, to make
him jealous of his son. They represented that it was but common
prudence to discover where the prince had retired, and how he
could afford to live so magnificently, since he had no revenue
assigned for his expenses; that he seemed to come to court only
to insult him, by affecting to shew that he wanted nothing from
his father to enable him to live like a prince; and that it was
to be feared he might court the people's favour and dethrone him.</p>

<p id="id03787">The sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that prince
Ahmed could be capable of so wicked a design, that he said to
them in displeasure, "You are mistaken, my son loves me, and I am
the more assured of his tenderness and fidelity, as I have given
him no reason to be disgusted."</p>

<p id="id03788">At these words, one of the favourites took an opportunity to say,
"Your majesty, in the opinion of the most sensible people, could
not have taken a better method than you did with the three
princes, respecting their marriage with the princess Nouronnihar;
but who knows whether prince Ahmed has submitted to his fate with
the same resignation as prince Houssain? May not he imagine that
he alone deserved her; and that your majesty, by leaving the
match to be decided by chance, has done him injustice?</p>

<p id="id03789">"Your majesty may say," added the malicious favourite, "that
prince Ahmed has manifested no appearance of dissatisfaction;
that our fears are vain; that we are too easily alarmed, and are
to blame in suggesting to you suspicions of this kind, which may,
perhaps, be unfounded, against a prince of your blood. But, sir,"
pursued the favourite, "it may be also, that these suspicions are
well grounded. Your majesty must be sensible, that in so nice and
important an affair you cannot be too much on your guard, and
should take the safest course. Consider, it is the prince's
interest to dissemble, amuse, and deceive you; and the danger is
the greater, as he resides not far from your capital; and if your
majesty give but the same attention that we do, you may observe
that every time he comes his attendants are different, their
habits new, and their arms clean and bright, as if just come from
the maker's hands; and their horses look as if they had only been
walked out. These are sufficient proofs that prince Ahmed does
not travel far, so that we should think ourselves wanting in our
duty did we not make our humble remonstrances, in order that, for
your own preservation and the good of your people, your majesty
may take such measures as you shall think advisable."</p>

<p id="id03790">When the favourite had concluded these insinuations, the sultan
said, "I do not believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would
persuade me he is; however, I am obliged to you for your advice,
and do not doubt that it proceeds from good intention and loyalty
to my person."</p>

<p id="id03791">The sultan of the Indies said this, that his favourites might not
know the impressions their observations had made on his mind. He
was, however, so much alarmed by them, that he resolved to have
prince Ahmed watched, unknown to his grand vizier. For this end
he sent for the sorceress, who was introduced by a private door
into his closet. "You told me the truth," said he, "when you
assured me my son Ahmed was alive, for which I am obliged to you.
You must do me another kindness. I have seen him since, and he
comes to my court every month; but I cannot learn from him where
he resides, and do not wish to force his secret from him; but
believe you are capable of satisfying my curiosity, without
letting him, or any of my court, know any thing of the discovery.
You know that he is at this time with me, and usually departs
without taking leave of me, or any of my court. Place yourself
immediately upon the road, and watch him so as to find out where
he retires, and bring me information."</p>

<p id="id03792">The sorceress left the sultan, and knowing the place where prince
Ahmed had found his arrow, went immediately thither, and
concealed herself near the rocks, so as not to be seen.</p>

<p id="id03793">The next morning prince Ahmed set out by daybreak, without taking
leave either of the sultan or any of his court, according to
custom. The sorceress seeing him coming, followed him with her
eyes, till suddenly she lost sight of him and his attendants.</p>

<p id="id03794">The steepness of the rocks formed an insurmountable barrier to
men, whether on horseback or on foot, so that the sorceress
judged that the prince retired either into some cavern, or some
subterraneous place, the abode of genies or fairies. When she
thought the prince and his attendants must have far advanced into
whatever concealment they inhabited, she came out of the place
where she had hidden herself, and explored the hollow way where
she had lost sight of them. She entered it, and proceeding to the
spot where it terminated after many windings, looked carefully on
all sides. But notwithstanding all her acuteness she could
perceive no opening, nor the iron gate which prince Ahmed had
discovered. For this door was to be seen by or opened to none but
men, and only to those whose presence was agreeable to the fairy
Perie Banou, but not at all to women.</p>

<p id="id03795">The sorceress, who saw it was in vain for her to search any
farther, was obliged to be satisfied with the insufficient
discovery she had made, and returned to communicate it to the
sultan. When she had told him what she had explored, she added,
"Your majesty may easily understand, after what I have had the
honour to tell you, that it will be no difficult matter to obtain
you the satisfaction you desire concerning prince Ahmed's
conduct. To do this, I only ask time, that you will have
patience, and give me leave to act, without inquiring what
measures I design to take."</p>

<p id="id03796">The sultan was pleased with the conduct of the sorceress, and
said to her, "Do you as you think fit; I will wait patiently the
event of your promises:" and to encourage her, he presented her
with a diamond of great value, telling her, it was only an
earnest of the ample recompense she should receive when she
should have performed the important service which he left to her
management.</p>

<p id="id03797">As prince Ahmed, after he had obtained the fairy Perie Banou's
leave, never failed once a month to visit his father, the
sorceress knowing the time, went a day or two before to the foot
of the rock where she had lost sight of him and his attendants,
and waited there to execute the project she had formed.</p>

<p id="id03798">The next morning prince Ahmed went out as usual at the iron gate,
with the same attendants as before, passed the sorceress, and
seeing her lie with her head on the rock, complaining as if she
was in great pain, he pitied her, turned his horse, and asked
what he could do to relieve her?</p>

<p id="id03799">The artful sorceress, without lifting up her head, looked at the
prince in such a manner as to increase his compassion, and
answered in broken accents and sighs, as if she could hardly
breathe, that she was going to the city; but in the way was taken
with so violent a fever, that her strength failed her, and she
was forced to stop and lie down where he saw her, far from any
habitation, and without any hopes of assistance.</p>

<p id="id03800">"Good woman," replied the prince, "you are not so far from help
as you imagine. I will assist you, and convey you where you shall
not only have all possible care taken of you, but where you will
find a speedy cure: rise, and let one of my people take you
behind him."</p>

<p id="id03801">At these words, the sorceress, who pretended sickness only to
explore where the prince resided, and his situation, did not
refuse the charitable offer, and to shew her acceptance rather by
her actions than her words, made many affected efforts to rise,
pretending that the violence of her illness prevented her. At the
same time, two of the prince's attendants alighting, helped her
up, and placed her behind another. They mounted their horses
again, and followed the prince, who turned back to the iron gate,
which was opened by one of his retinue. When he came into the
outward court of the fairy's palace, without dismounting himself,
he sent to tell her he wanted to speak with her.</p>

<p id="id03802">The fairy came with all imaginable haste, not knowing what had
made prince Ahmed return so soon; who, not giving her time to
ask, said, "My princess, I desire you would have compassion on
this good woman," pointing to the sorceress, who was taken off
the horse by two of his retinue; "I found her in the condition
you see her, and promised her the assistance she requires. I
recommend her to your care, and am persuaded that you, from
inclination, as well as my request, will not abandon her."</p>

<p id="id03803">The fairy, who had her eyes fixed on the pretended sick woman all
the time the prince was speaking, ordered two of her women to
take her from the men who supported her, conduct her into an
apartment of the palace, and take as much care of her as they
would of herself.</p>

<p id="id03804">Whilst the two women were executing the fairy's commands, she
went up to prince Ahmed, and whispering him in the ear, said,
"Prince, I commend your compassion, which is worthy of you and
your birth. I take great pleasure in gratifying your good
intention; but permit me to tell you I am afraid it will be but
ill rewarded. This woman is not so sick as she pretends to be;
and I am much mistaken if she is not sent hither on purpose to
occasion you great trouble. But do not be concerned, let what
will be devised against you; be persuaded that I will deliver you
out of all the snares that shall be laid for you. Go and pursue
your journey."</p>

<p id="id03805">This address of the fairy's did not in the least alarm prince
Ahmed. "My princess," said he, "as I do not remember I ever did,
or designed to do, any body injury, I cannot believe any one can
have a thought of injuring me; but if they have, I shall not
forbear doing good whenever I have an opportunity." So saying, he
took leave of the fairy, and set forward again for his father's
capital, where he soon arrived, and was received as usual by the
sultan, who constrained himself as much as possible, to disguise
the anxiety arising from the suspicions suggested by his
favourites.</p>

<p id="id03806">In the mean time, the two women to whom Perie Banou had given her
orders conveyed the sorceress into an elegant apartment, richly
furnished. They first set her down upon a sofa, with her back
supported by a cushion of gold brocade, while they made a bed on
the same sofa, the quilt of which was finely embroidered with
silk, the sheets of the finest linen, and the coverlid cloth of
gold. When they had put her into bed (for the old sorceress
pretended that her fever was so violent she could not help
herself in the least), one of the women went out, and returned
soon with a china cup in her hand, full of a certain liquor,
which she presented to the sorceress, while the other helped her
to sit up. "Drink this," said the attendant, "it is the water of
the fountain of lions, and a sovereign remedy against fevers. You
will find the effect of it in less than an hour's time."</p>

<p id="id03807">The sorceress, the better to dissemble, took it, after a great
deal of entreaty, as if she did it with reluctance. When she was
laid down again, the two women covered her up: "Lie quiet," said
she, who brought her the china cup, "and get a little sleep, if
you can: we will leave you, and hope to find you perfectly
recovered when we return an hour hence."</p>

<p id="id03808">The sorceress, who came not to act a sick part long, but to
discover prince Ahmed's retreat, being fully satisfied in what
she wanted to know, would willingly have declared that the potion
had then had its effect, so great was her desire to return to the
sultan, to inform him of the success of her commission: but as
she had been told that the potion did not operate immediately,
she was forced to wait the women's return.</p>

<p id="id03809">The two women came again at the time they had mentioned, and
found the sorceress seated on the sofa; who, when she saw them
open the door of the apartment, cried out, "O the admirable
potion! it has wrought its cure much sooner than you told me it
would, and I have waited with impatience to desire you to conduct
me to your charitable mistress, to thank her for her kindness,
for which I shall always feel obliged; but being thus cured as by
a miracle, I would not lose time, but prosecute my journey."</p>

<p id="id03810">The two women, who were fairies as well as their mistress, after
they had told the sorceress how glad they were that she was cured
so soon, walked before her, and conducted her through several
apartments, all more superb than that wherein she had lain, into
a large hall, the most richly and magnificently furnished of all
the palace.</p>

<p id="id03811">Perie Banou was seated in this hall, upon a throne of massive
gold, enriched with diamonds, rubies, and pearls of an
extraordinary size, and attended on each hand by a great number
of beautiful fairies, all richly dressed. At the sight of so much
splendour, the sorceress was not only dazzled, but so struck,
that after she had prostrated herself before the throne, she
could not open her lips to thank the fairy, as she had proposed.
However, Perie Banou saved her the trouble, and said, "Good
woman, I am glad I had an opportunity to oblige you, and that you
are able to pursue your journey. I will not detain you; but
perhaps you may not be displeased to see my palace: follow my
women, and they will shew it you."</p>

<p id="id03812">The old sorceress, who had not power nor courage to say a word,
prostrated herself a second time, with her head on the carpet
that covered the foot of the throne, took her leave, and was
conducted by the two fairies through the same apartments which
were shewn to prince Ahmed at his first arrival, and at sight of
their uncommon magnificence she made frequent exclamations. But
what surprised her most of all was, that the two fairies told
her, that all she saw and so much admired was a mere sketch of
their mistress's grandeur and riches; for that in the extent of
her dominions she had so many palaces that they could not tell
the number of them, all of different plans and architecture, but
equally magnificent. In speaking of many other particulars, they
led her at last to the iron gate at which prince Ahmed had
brought her in; and after she had taken her leave of them, and
thanked them for their trouble, they opened it, and wished her a
good journey.</p>

<p id="id03813">After the sorceress had gone a little way, she turned to observe
the door, that she might know it again, but all in vain; for, as
was before observed, it was invisible to her and all other women.
Except in this circumstance, she was very well satisfied with her
success, and posted away to the sultan. When she came to the
capital, she went by many by-ways to the private door of the
palace. The sultan being informed of her arrival, sent for her
into his apartment, and perceiving a melancholy hang upon her
countenance, thought she had not succeeded, and said to her, "By
your looks, I guess that your journey has been to no purpose, and
that you have not made the discovery I expected from your
diligence." "Sir," replied the sorceress, "your majesty must give
me leave to represent that you ought not to judge by my looks
whether or no I have acquitted myself well in the execution of
the commands you were pleased to honour me with; but by the
faithful report I shall make you of all that has happened to me,
and by which you will find that I have not neglected any thing
that could render me worthy of your approbation. The melancholy
you observe proceeds from another cause than the want of success,
which I hope your majesty will have ample reason to be satisfied
with. I do not tell you the cause; the relation I shall give will
inform you."</p>

<p id="id03814">The sorceress now related to the sultan of the Indies how,
pretending to be sick, prince Ahmed compassionating her, had her
carried into a subterraneous abode, and presented and recommended
her to a fairy of incomparable beauty, desiring her by her care
to restore her health. She then told him with how much
condescension the fairy had immediately ordered two women to take
care of her, and not to leave her till she was recovered; which
great condescension, said she, could proceed from no other
female, but from a wife to a husband. Afterwards the old
sorceress failed not to dwell on her surprise at the front of the
palace, which she said had not its equal for magnificence in the
world. She gave a particular account of the care they took of
her, after they had led her into an apartment; of the potion they
made her drink, and of the quickness of her cure; which she had
pretended as well as her sickness, though she doubted not the
virtue of the draught; the majesty of the fairy seated on a
throne, brilliant with jewels, the value of which exceeded all
the riches of the kingdom of the Indies, and all the other
treasures beyond computation contained in that vast palace.</p>

<p id="id03815">Here the sorceress finishing the relation of the success of her
commission, and continuing her discourse, said, "What does your
majesty think of these unheard-of riches of the fairy? Perhaps
you will say, you are struck with admiration, and rejoice at the
good fortune of prince Ahmed your son, who enjoys them in common
with the fairy. For my part, sir, I beg of your majesty to
forgive me if I take the liberty to say that I think otherwise,
and that I shudder when I consider the misfortunes which may
happen to you from his present situation. And this is the cause
of the melancholy which I could not so well dissemble, but that
you soon perceived it. I would believe that prince Ahmed, by his
own good disposition, is incapable of undertaking anything
against your majesty; but who can answer that the fairy, by her
attractions and caresses, and the influence she has over him, may
not inspire him with the unnatural design of dethroning your
majesty, and seizing the crown of the Indies? This is what your
majesty ought to consider as of the utmost importance."</p>

<p id="id03816">Though the sultan of the Indies was persuaded that prince Ahmed's
natural disposition was good, yet he could not help being moved
at the representations of the old sorceress, and said, "I thank
you for the pains you have taken, and your wholesome caution. I
am so sensible of its great importance that I shall take advice
upon it."</p>

<p id="id03817">He was consulting with his favourites, when he was told of the
sorceress's arrival. He ordered her to follow him to them. He
acquainted them with what he had learnt, communicated to them the
reason he had to fear the fairy's influence over the prince, and
asked them what measures they thought most proper to be taken to
prevent so great a misfortune as might possibly happen. One of
the favourites, taking upon himself to speak for the rest, said,
"Your majesty knows who must be the author of this mischief. In
order to prevent it, now he is in your court, and in your power,
you ought not to hesitate to put him under arrest; I will not say
take away his life, for that would make too much noise; but make
him a close prisoner." This advice all the other favourites
unanimously applauded.</p>

<p id="id03818">The sorceress, who thought it too violent, asked the sultan leave
to speak, which being granted, she said, "I am persuaded it is
the zeal of your counsellors for your majesty's interest that
makes them propose arresting prince Ahmed. But they will not take
it amiss if I offer to your and their consideration, that if you
arrest the prince you must also detain his retinue. But they are
all genies. Do they think it will be so easy to surprise, seize,
and secure their persons? will they not disappear, by the
property they possess of rendering themselves invisible, and
transport themselves instantly to the fairy, and give her an
account of the insult offered her husband? And can it be supposed
she will let it go unrevenged? Would it not be better, if by any
other means which might not make so great a noise, the sultan
could secure himself against any ill designs prince Ahmed may
have, and not involve his majesty's honour? If his majesty has
any confidence in my advice, as genies and fairies can do things
impracticable to men, he will rather trust prince Ahmed's honour,
and engage him by means of the fairy to procure certain
advantages, by flattering his ambition, and at the same time
narrowly watching him. For example; every time your majesty takes
the field, you are obliged to be at a great expense, not only in
pavilions and tents for yourself and army, but likewise in mules
and camels, and other beasts of burden, to carry their baggage.
Request the prince to procure you a tent, which can be carried in
a man's hand, but so large as to shelter your whole army.</p>

<p id="id03819">"I need say no more to your majesty. If the prince brings such a
tent, you may make other demands of the same nature, so that at
last he may sink under the difficulties and the impossibility of
executing them, however fertile in means and inventions the
fairy, who has enticed him from you by her enchantments, may be;
so that in time he will be ashamed to appear, and will be forced
to pass the rest of his life with the fairy, excluded from any
commerce with this world; when your majesty will have nothing to
fear from him, and cannot be reproached with so detestable an
action as the shedding of a son's blood, or confining him for
life in a prison."</p>

<p id="id03820">When the sorceress had finished her speech, the sultan asked his
favourites if they had any thing better to propose; and finding
them all silent, determined to follow her advice, as the most
reasonable and most agreeable to his mild manner of government.</p>

<p id="id03821">The next day when the prince came into his father's presence, who
was talking with his favourites, and had sat down by him, after a
conversation on different subjects, the sultan, addressing
himself to prince Ahmed, said, "Son, when you came and dispelled
those clouds of melancholy which your long absence had brought
upon me, you made the place you had chosen for your retreat a
mastery. I was satisfied with seeing you again, and knowing that
you were content with your condition, sought not to penetrate
into your secret, which I found you did not wish I should. I know
not what reason you had thus to treat a father, who ever was and
still continues anxious for your happiness. I now know your good
fortune. I rejoice with you, and much approve of your conduct in
marrying a fairy so worthy of your love, and so rich and powerful
as I am informed she is. Powerful as I am, it was not possible
for me to have procured for you so great a match. Now you are
raised to so high a rank, as to be envied by all but a father, I
not only desire to preserve the good understanding which has
hitherto subsisted between us, but request that you will use your
influence with your wife, to obtain her assistance when I may
want it. I will therefore make a trial of your interest this day.</p>

<p id="id03822">"You are not insensible at what a great expense, not to say
trouble to my generals, officers, and myself, every time I take
the field, they provide tents, mules, camels, and other beasts of
burden, to carry them. If you consider the pleasure you would do
me, I am persuaded you could easily procure from the fairy a
pavilion that might be carried in a man's hand, and which would
extend over my whole army; especially when you let her know it is
for me. Though it may be a difficult thing to procure, she will
not refuse you. All the world knows fairies are capable of
executing most extraordinary undertakings."</p>

<p id="id03823">Prince Ahmed never expected that the sultan his father would have
made a demand like this, which appeared to him so difficult, not
to say impossible. Though he knew not absolutely how great the
power of genii and fairies was, he doubted whether it extended so
far as to furnish such a tent as his father desired. Moreover, he
had never asked any thing of the fairy Perie Banou, but was
satisfied with the continual proofs she had given him of her
passion, and had neglected nothing to persuade her that his heart
perfectly corresponded without any views beyond maintaining
himself in her good graces: he was therefore in the greatest
embarrassment what answer to make. At last he replied, "If, sir,
I have concealed from your majesty what has happened to me, and
what course I took after finding my arrow, the reason was, that I
thought it of no great importance to you to be informed of such
circumstances; and though I know not how this mystery has been
revealed to you, I cannot deny but your information is correct. I
have married the fairy you speak of. I love her, and am persuaded
she loves me in return. But I can say nothing as to the influence
your majesty believes I have over her. It is what I have not yet
proved, nor thought of trying, but could wish you would dispense
with my making the experiment, and let me enjoy the happiness of
loving and being beloved, with all that disinterestedness I had
proposed to myself. However, the demand of a father is a command
upon every child, who, like me, thinks it his duty to obey him in
every thing. And though it is with the greatest reluctance, I
will not fail to ask my wife the favour your majesty desires, but
cannot promise you to obtain it; and if I should not have the
honour to come again to pay you my respects, it will be the sign
that I have not been able to succeed in my request: but
beforehand, I desire you to forgive me, and consider that you
yourself have reduced me to this extremity."</p>

<p id="id03824">"Son," replied the sultan of the Indies, "I should be sorry that
what I ask should oblige you to deprive me of the gratification
of seeing you as usual. I find you do not know the power a
husband has over a wife; and yours would shew that her love to
you was very slight, if, with the power she possesses as a fairy,
she should refuse so trifling a request as that I have begged you
to make. Lay aside your fears, which proceed from your believing
yourself not to be loved so well as you love her. Go; only ask
her. You will find the fairy loves you better than you imagine;
and remember that people, for want of requesting, often lose
great advantages. Think with yourself, that as you love her, you
could refuse her nothing; therefore, if she loves you, she will
not deny your requests."</p>

<p id="id03825">All these representations of the sultan of the Indies could not
satisfy prince Ahmed, who would rather he had asked anything else
than, as he supposed, what must expose him to the hazard of
displeasing his beloved Perie Banou; and so great was his
vexation that he left the court two days sooner than he used to
do.</p>

<p id="id03826">When he returned, the fairy, to whom he always before had
appeared with a gay countenance, asked him the cause of the
alteration she perceived in his looks; and finding that instead
of answering he inquired after her health, to avoid satisfying
her, she said to him, "I will answer your question when you have
answered mine." The prince declined a long time, protesting that
nothing was the matter with him; but the more he denied the more
she pressed him, and said, "I cannot bear to see you thus: tell
me what makes you uneasy, that I may remove the cause, whatever
it may be; for it must be very extraordinary if it is out of my
power, unless it be the death of the sultan your father; in that
case, time, with all that I will contribute on my part, can alone
comfort you."</p>

<p id="id03827">Prince Ahmed could not long withstand the pressing instances of
the fairy. "Madam," said he, "God prolong the sultan my father's
life, and bless him to the end of his days. I left him alive and
in perfect health; therefore that is not the cause of the
melancholy you perceive in me. The sultan, however, is the
occasion of it, and I am the more concerned because he has
imposed upon me the disagreeable necessity of importuning you.
You know the care I have at your desire taken to conceal from him
the happiness I have enjoyed in living with you, and of having
received the pledge of your faith after having pledged my love to
you. How he has been informed of it I cannot tell."</p>

<p id="id03828">Here the fairy interrupted prince Ahmed, and said, "But I know.
Remember what I told you of the woman who made you believe she
was sick, on whom you took so much compassion. It is she who has
acquainted your father with what you have taken so much care to
hide from him. I told you that she was no more sick than you or
I, and she has made it appear so; for, in short, after the two
women, whom I charged to take care of her, had given her the
water sovereign against all fevers, but which however she had no
occasion for, she pretended that it had cured her, and was
brought to take her leave of me that she might go the sooner to
give an account of the success of her undertaking. She was in so
much haste, that she would have gone away without seeing my
palace if I had not, by bidding my two women shew it her, given
her to understand that it was worth her seeing. But proceed and
tell me what is the necessity your father has imposed on you to
be so importunate, which, be persuaded, however, you can never be
to your affectionate wife."</p>

<p id="id03829">"Madam," pursued prince Ahmed, "you may have observed that
hitherto I have been content with your love, and have never asked
you any other favour: for what, after the possession of so
amiable a wife, can I desire more? I know how great your power
is, but I have taken care not to make proof of it to please
myself. Consider then, I conjure you, that it is not myself, but
the sultan my father, who, indiscreetly as I think, asks of you a
pavilion large enough to shelter him, his court, and army, from
the violence of the weather, when he takes the field, and which a
man may carry in his hand. Once more remember it is not I, but
the sultan my father who asks this favour."</p>

<p id="id03830">"Prince," replied the fairy smiling, "I am sorry that so trifling
a matter should disturb and make you so uneasy as you appear. I
see plainly two things have contributed towards it: one is, the
law you have imposed on yourself, to be content with loving me,
being beloved by me, and deny yourself the liberty of soliciting
the least favour that might try my power. The other, I do not
doubt, whatever you may say, was, that you thought that what your
father asked was out of my power. As to the first, I commend you,
and shall love you the better, if possible, for it; and for the
second, I must tell you that what the sultan your father requests
is a trifle; as upon occasion I can do him more important
service. Therefore be easy in your mind, and persuaded that far
from thinking myself importuned I shall always take real pleasure
in performing whatever you can desire." Perie Banou then sent for
her treasurer, to whom, when she came, she said, "Noor-Jehaun"
(which was her name), "bring me the largest pavilion in my
treasury." Noor-Jehaun returned presently with a pavilion, which
could not only be held, but concealed in the palm of the hand,
when it was closed, and presented it to her mistress, who gave it
prince Ahmed to look at.</p>

<p id="id03831">When prince Ahmed saw the pavilion, which the fairy called the
largest in her treasury, he fancied she had a mind to banter him,
and his surprise soon appeared in his countenance; which Perie
Banou perceiving, she burst out a laughing. "What! prince," cried
she, "do you think I jest with you? You will see that I am in
earnest. Noor-Jehaun," said she to her treasurer, taking the tent
out of prince Ahmed's hands, "go and set it up, that he may judge
whether the sultan his father will think it large enough."</p>

<p id="id03832">The treasurer went out immediately with it from the palace, and
carried it to such a distance, that when she had set it up, one
end reached to the palace. The prince, so far from thinking it
small, found it large enough to shelter two armies as numerous as
that of the sultan his father; and then said to Perie Banou, "I
ask my princess a thousand pardons for my incredulity: after what
I have seen, I believe there is nothing impossible to you." "You
see," said the fairy, "that the pavilion is larger than your
father may have occasion for; but you are to observe that it has
one property, that it becomes larger or smaller, according to the
extent of the army it is to cover, without applying any hands to
it."</p>

<p id="id03833">The treasurer took down the tent again, reduced it to its first
size, brought it and put it into the prince's hands. He took it,
and without staying longer than till the next day, mounted his
horse, and went with the usual attendants to the sultan his
father.</p>

<p id="id03834">The sultan, who was persuaded that such a tent as he had asked
for was beyond all possibility, was in great surprise at the
prince's speedy return. He took the tent, but after he had
admired its smallness, his amazement was so great that he could
not recover himself when he had set it up in the great plain
before-mentioned, and found it large enough to shelter an army
twice as large as he could bring into the field. Regarding this
excess in its dimension as what might be troublesome in the use,
prince Ahmed told him that its size would always be
proportionable to his army.</p>

<p id="id03835">To outward appearance the sultan expressed great obligation to
the prince for so noble a present, desiring him to return his
thanks to the fairy; and to shew what a value he set upon it,
ordered it to be carefully laid up in his treasury. But within
himself he felt greater jealousy than his flatterers and the
sorceress had suggested to him; considering, that by the fairy's
assistance the prince his son might perform things infinitely
above his own power, notwithstanding his greatness and riches;
therefore, more intent upon his ruin, he went to consult the
sorceress again, who advised him to engage the prince to bring
him some of the water of the fountain of lions.</p>

<p id="id03836">In the evening, when the sultan was surrounded as usual by all
his court, and the prince came to pay his respects among the
rest, he addressed himself to him in these words: "Son, I have
already expressed to you how much I am obliged for the present of
the tent you have procured me, which I esteem the most valuable
curiosity in my treasury: but you must do one thing more, which
will be no less agreeable to me. I am informed that the fairy
your spouse makes use of a certain water, called the water of the
fountain of lions, which cures all sorts of fevers, even the most
dangerous; and as I am perfectly well persuaded my health is dear
to you, I do not doubt but you will ask her for a bottle of that
water, and bring it me as a sovereign remedy, which I may use as
I have occasion. Do me this important service, and complete the
duty of a good son towards a tender father."</p>

<p id="id03837">Prince Ahmed, who believed that the sultan his father would have
been satisfied with so singular and useful a tent as that which
he had brought, and that he would not have imposed any new task
upon him which might hazard the fairy's displeasure, was
thunderstruck at this new request, notwithstanding the assurance
she had given him of granting him whatever lay in her power.
After a long silence, he said, "I beg of your majesty to be
assured, that there is nothing I would not undertake to procure
which may contribute to the prolonging of your life, but I could
wish it might not be by the means of my wife. For this reason I
dare not promise to bring the water. All I can do is, to assure
you I will request it of her; but it will be with as great
reluctance as I asked for the tent."</p>

<p id="id03838">The next morning prince Ahmed returned to the fairy Perie Banou,
and related to her sincerely and faithfully all that had passed
at his father's court from the giving of the tent, which he told
her he received with the utmost gratitude, to the new request he
had charged him to make. He added: "But, my princess, I only tell
you this as a plain account of what passed between me and my
father. I leave you to your own pleasure, whether you will
gratify or reject this his new desire. It shall be as you
please."</p>

<p id="id03839">"No, no," replied the fairy, "I am glad that the sultan of the
Indies knows that you are not indifferent to me. I will satisfy
him, and whatever advice the sorceress may give him (for I see
that he hearkens to her counsel), he shall find no fault with you
or me. There is much wickedness in this demand, as you will
understand by what I am going to tell you. The fountain of lions
is situated in the middle of a court of a great castle, the
entrance into which is guarded by four fierce lions, two of which
sleep alternately, while the other two are awake. But let not
that frighten you. I will supply you with means to pass by them
without danger."</p>

<p id="id03840">The fairy Perie Banou was at that time at work with her needle;
and as she had by her several clues of thread, she took up one,
and presenting it to prince Ahmed, said, "First take this clue of
thread, I will tell you presently the use of it. In the second
place, you must have two horses; one you must ride yourself, and
the other you must lead, which must be loaded with a sheep cut
into four quarters, that must be killed to-day. In the third
place, you must be provided with a bottle, which I will give you,
to bring the water in. Set out early to-morrow morning, and when
you have passed the iron gate throw before you the clue of
thread, which will roll till it reaches the gates of the castle.
Follow it, and when it stops, as the gates will be open, you will
see the four lions. The two that are awake will, by their
roaring, wake the other two. Be not alarmed, but throw each of
them a quarter of the sheep, and then clap spurs to your horse,
and ride to the fountain. Fill your bottle without alighting, and
return with the same expedition. The lions will be so busy eating
they will let you pass unmolested."</p>

<p id="id03841">Prince Ahmed set out the next morning at the time appointed him
by the fairy, and followed her directions punctually. When he
arrived at the gates of the castle, he distributed the quarters
of the sheep among the four lions, and passing through the midst
of them with intrepidity, got to the fountain, filled his bottle,
and returned safe. When he had got a little distance from the
castle gates, he turned about; and perceiving two of the lions
coming after him, drew his sabre, and prepared himself for
defence. But as he went forwards, he saw one of them turn out of
the road at some distance, and shewed by his head and tail that
he did not come to do him any harm, but only to go before him,
and that the other stayed behind to follow. He therefore put his
sword again into its scabbard. Guarded in this manner he arrived
at the capital of the Indies; but the lions never left him till
they had conducted him to the gates of the sultan's palace; after
which they returned the way they had come, though not without
alarming the populace, who fled or hid themselves to avoid them,
notwithstanding they walked gently and shewed no signs of
fierceness.</p>

<p id="id03842">A number of officers came to attend the prince while he
dismounted, and conduct him to the sultan's apartment, who was at
that time conversing with his favourites. He approached the
throne, laid the bottle at the sultan's feet, kissed the rich
carpet which covered the footstool, and rising, said, "I have
brought you, sir, the salutary water which your majesty so much
desired to store up among other rarities in your treasury; but at
the same time wish you such health as never to have occasion to
make use of it."</p>

<p id="id03843">After the prince had concluded his compliment, the sultan placed
him on his right hand, and said, "Son, I am much obliged to you
for this valuable present; as also for the great danger you have
exposed yourself to on my account (which I have been informed of
by the sorceress, who knows the fountain of lions); but do me the
pleasure, continued he, to inform me by what address, or rather
by what incredible power, you have been preserved."</p>

<p id="id03844">"Sir," replied prince Ahmed, "I have no share in the compliment
your majesty is pleased to make me; all the honour is due to the
fairy my spouse, and I take no other merit than that of having
followed her advice." Then he informed the sultan what that
advice was, by the relation of his expedition, and how he had
conducted himself. When he had done, the sultan, who shewed
outwardly all the demonstrations of joy, but secretly became more
and more jealous, retired into an inward apartment, whence he
sent for the sorceress.</p>

<p id="id03845">The sorceress, on her arrival, saved the sultan the trouble of
telling her of the success of prince Ahmed's journey, which she
had heard before she came, and therefore was prepared with a new
request. This she communicated to the sultan, who declared it the
next day to the prince, in the midst of all his courtiers, in
these words: "Son, I have one thing yet to ask of you; after
which, I shall expect nothing more from your obedience, nor your
interest with your wife. This request is, to bring me a man not
above a foot and a half high, whose beard is thirty feet long,
who carries upon his shoulders a bar of iron of five hundred
weight, which he uses as a quarter-staff, and who can speak."</p>

<p id="id03846">Prince Ahmed, who did not believe that there was such a man in
the world as his father had described, would gladly have excused
himself; but the sultan persisted in his demand, and told him the
fairy could do more incredible things.</p>

<p id="id03847">Next day the prince returned to the subterraneous kingdom of
Perie Banou, to whom he related his father's new demand, which,
he said, he looked upon to be a thing more impossible than the
two first. "For," added he, "I cannot imagine there is or can be
such a man in the world; without doubt he has a mind to try
whether I am silly enough to search, or if there is such a man he
seeks my ruin. In short, how can we suppose that I should lay
hold of a man so small, armed as he describes? what arms can I
use to reduce him to submission? If there are any means, I beg
you will tell me how I may come off with honour this time also."</p>

<p id="id03848">"Do not alarm yourself, prince," replied the fairy: "you ran a
risk in fetching the water of the fountain of the lions for your
father; but there is no danger in finding this man. It is my
brother Schaibar, who is so far from being like me, though we
both had the same father, that he is of so violent a nature, that
nothing can prevent his giving bloody marks of his resentment for
a slight offence; yet, on the other hand, is so liberal as to
oblige any one in whatever they desire. He is made exactly as the
sultan your father has described him; and has no other arms than
a bar of iron of five hundred pounds weight, without which he
never stirs, and which makes him respected. I will send for him,
and you shall judge of the truth of what I tell you; but prepare
yourself not to be alarmed at his extraordinary figure." "What!
my queen," replied prince Ahmed, "do you say Schaibar is your
brother? Let him be ever so ugly or deformed I shall be so far
from being frightened at his appearance, that I shall love and
honour him, and consider him as my nearest relation."</p>

<p id="id03849">The fairy ordered a gold chafing-dish to be set with a fire in it
under the porch of her palace, with a box of the same metal: out
of the latter she took some incense, and threw it into the fire,
when there arose a thick cloud of smoke.</p>

<p id="id03850">Some moments after, the fairy said to prince Ahmed, "Prince,
there comes my brother; do you see him?" The prince immediately
perceived Schaibar, who was but a foot and a half high, coming
gravely with his heavy bar on his shoulder; his beard thirty feet
long, which supported itself before him, and a pair of thick
moustaches in proportion, tucked up to his ears, and almost
covering his face: his eyes were very small, like a pig's, and
deep sunk in his head, which was of an enormous size, and on
which he wore a pointed cap: besides all this, he had a hump
behind and and before.</p>

<p id="id03851">If prince Ahmed had not known that Schaibar was Perie Banou's
brother, he would not have been able to behold him without fear;
but knowing who he was, he waited for him with the fairy, and
received him without the least concern.</p>

<p id="id03852">Schaibar, as he came forwards, looked at the prince with an eye
that would have chilled his soul in his body, and asked Perie
Banou, when he first accosted her, who that man was? To which she
replied, "He is my husband, brother; his name is Ahmed; he is a
son of the sultan of the Indies. The reason why I did not invite
you to my wedding was, I was unwilling to divert you from the
expedition you were engaged in, and from which I heard with
pleasure you returned victorious; on his account I have taken the
liberty now to call for you."</p>

<p id="id03853">At these words, Schaibar, looking at prince Ahmed with a
favourable eye, which however diminished neither his fierceness
nor savage look, said, "Is there any thing, sister, wherein I can
serve him? he has only to speak. It is enough for me that he is
your husband, to engage me to do for him whatever he desires."
"The sultan his father," replied Perie Banou, "has a curiosity to
see you, and I desire he may be your guide to the sultan's
court." "He needs but lead the way; I will follow him," replied
Schaibar. "Brother," resumed Perie Banou, "it is too late to go
to-day, therefore stay till to-morrow morning; and in the mean
time, as it is fit you should know all that has passed between
the sultan of the Indies and prince Ahmed since our marriage, I
will inform you this evening."</p>

<p id="id03854">The next morning, after Schaibar had been informed of all that
was proper for him to know, he set out with prince Ahmed, who was
to present him to the sultan. When they arrived at the gates of
the capital, the people, as soon as they saw Schaibar, ran and
hid themselves in their shops and houses, shutting their doors,
while others taking to their heels, communicated their fear to
all they met, who stayed not to look behind them; insomuch, that
Schaibar and prince Ahmed, as they went along, found all the
streets and squares desolate, till they came to the palace, where
the porters, instead of preventing Schaibar from entering, ran
away too; so that the prince and he advanced without any obstacle
to the council-hall, where the sultan was seated on his throne
and giving audience. Here likewise the officers, at the approach
of Schaibar, abandoned their posts, and gave them free
admittance.</p>

<p id="id03855">Schaibar, carrying his head erect, went fiercely up to the
throne, without waiting to be presented by prince Ahmed, and
accosted the sultan of the Indies in these words: "You have asked
for me," said he; "see, here I am, what would you have with me?"</p>

<p id="id03856">The sultan, instead of answering, clapped his hands before his
eyes, and turned away his head, to avoid the sight of so terrible
an object. Schaibar was so much provoked at this uncivil and rude
reception, after he had given him the trouble to come so far,
that he instantly lifted up his iron bar, saying, "Speak, then;"
let it fall on his head, and killed him, before prince Ahmed
could intercede in his behalf. All that he could do was to
prevent his killing the grand vizier, who sat not far from him on
his right hand, representing to him that he had always given the
sultan his father good advice. "These are they then," said
Schaibar, "who gave him bad;" and as he pronounced these words,
he killed all the other viziers on the right and left, flatterers
and favourites of the sultan, who were prince Ahmed's enemies.
Every time he struck he crushed some one or other, and none
escaped but those who, not rendered motionless by fear, saved
themselves by flight.</p>

<p id="id03857">When this terrible execution was over, Schaibar came out of the
council-hall into the court-yard with the iron bar upon his
shoulder, and looking at the grand vizier, who owed his life to
prince Ahmed, said, "I know there is here a certain sorceress,
who is a greater enemy of the prince my brother-in-law than all
those base favourites I have chastised; let her be brought to me
immediately." The grand vizier instantly sent for her, and as
soon as she was brought, Schaibar, knocking her down with his
iron bar, said, "Take the reward of thy pernicious counsel, and
learn to feign sickness again;" he left her dead on the spot.</p>

<p id="id03858">After this he said, "This is not yet enough; I will treat the
whole city in the same manner, if they do not immediately
acknowledge prince Ahmed my brother-in-law as sultan of the
Indies." Then all who were present made the air ring with the
repeated acclamations of "Long life to sultan Ahmed;" and
immediately after, he was proclaimed through the whole
metropolis. Schaibar caused him to be clothed in the royal
vestments, installed him on the throne, and after he had made all
swear homage and fidelity, returned to his sister Perie Banou,
whom he brought with great pomp, and made her to be owned
sultaness of the Indies.</p>

<p id="id03859">As for prince Ali and princess Nouronnihar, as they had no
concern in the conspiracy, prince Ahmed assigned them a
considerable province, with its capital, where they spent the
rest of their lives. Afterwards he sent an officer to Houssain,
to acquaint him with the change, and make him an offer of any
province he might choose; but that prince thought himself so
happy in his solitude, that he desired the officer to return his
brother thanks for the kindness he designed him, assuring him of
his submission; but that the only favour he desired was, to be
indulged with leave to live retired in the place he had chosen
for his retreat.</p>

<h2 id="id03860" style="margin-top: 4em">           THE STORY OF THE SISTERS WHO ENVIED THEIR
                        YOUNGER SISTER.</h2>

<p id="id03861" style="margin-top: 3em">There was an emperor of Persia named Khoosroo Shaw, who, when he
first came to his crown, in order to obtain a knowledge of
affairs, took great pleasure in night adventures, attended by a
trusty minister. He often walked in disguise through the city,
and met with many adventures.</p>

<p id="id03862">After the ceremonies of his father's funeral-rites and his own
inauguration were over, the new sultan, as well from inclination
as duty, went out one evening attended by his grand vizier,
disguised like himself, to observe what was transacting in the
city. As he was passing through a street in that part of the town
inhabited only by the meaner sort, he heard some people talking
very loud; and going close to the house whence the noise
proceeded, and looking through a crack in the door, perceived a
light, and three sisters sitting on a sofa, conversing together
after supper. By what the eldest said, he presently understood
the subject of their conversation was wishes: "For," said she,
"since we have got upon wishes, mine shall be to have the
sultan's baker for my husband, for then I shall eat my fill of
that bread, which by way of excellence is called the sultan's:
let us see if your tastes are as good as mine." "For my part,"
replied the second sister, "I wish I was wife to the sultan's
chief cook, for then I should eat of the most excellent dishes;
and as I am persuaded that the sultan's bread is common in the
palace, I should not want any of that; therefore you see,"
addressing herself to her eldest sister, "that I have a better
taste than you."</p>

<p id="id03863">The youngest sister, who was very beautiful, and had more charms
and wit than the two elder, spoke in her turn: "For my part,
sisters," said she, "I shall not limit my desires to such
trifles, but take a higher flight; and since we are upon wishing,
I wish to be the emperor's queen consort. I would make him father
of a prince, whose hair should be gold on one side of his head,
and silver on the other; when he cried, the tears from his eyes
should be pearl; and when he smiled, his vermilion lips should
look like a rose-bud fresh blown."</p>

<p id="id03864">The three sisters' wishes, particularly that of the youngest,
seemed so singular to the sultan, that he resolved to gratify
them in their desires; but without communicating his design to
his grand vizier, he charged him only to take notice of the
house, and bring the three sisters before him the following day.</p>

<p id="id03865">The grand vizier, in executing the emperor's orders, would but
just give the sisters time to dress themselves to appear before
him, without telling them the reason. He brought them to the
palace, and presented them to the emperor, who said to them, "Do
you remember the wishes you expressed last night, when you were
all in so pleasant a mood? Speak the truth; I must know what they
were."</p>

<p id="id03866">At these unexpected words of the emperor, the three sisters were
much confounded. They cast down their eyes and blushed, and the
colour which rose in the cheeks of the youngest quite captivated
the emperor's heart. Modesty, and fear lest they might have
offended the emperor by their conversation, kept them silent. The
emperor perceiving their confusion, said, to encourage them,
"Fear nothing, I did not send for you to distress you; and since
I see that is the effect of the question I asked, without my
intending it, as I know the wish of each, I will relieve you from
your fears. You," added he, "who wished to be my wife shall have
your desire this day; and you," continued he, addressing himself
to the two elder sisters, "shall also be married to my chief
baker and cook."</p>

<p id="id03867">As soon as the sultan had declared his pleasure, the youngest
sister, setting her eldest an example, threw herself at the
emperor's feet, to express her gratitude. "Sir," said she, "my
wish, since it is come to your majesty's knowledge, was expressed
only in the way of conversation and amusement. I am unworthy of
the honour you do me, and supplicate your pardon for my
presumption." The two other sisters would have excused themselves
also; but the emperor interrupting them, said, "No, no; it shall
be as I have declared; every one's wish shall be fulfilled."</p>

<p id="id03868">The nuptials were all celebrated that day, as the emperor had
resolved, but in a different manner. The youngest sister's were
solemnized with all the rejoicings usual at the marriages of the
emperors of Persia; and those of the other two sisters according
to the quality and distinction of their husbands; the one as the
sultan's chief baker, and the other as head cook.</p>

<p id="id03869">The two elder felt strongly the disproportion of their marriages
to that of their younger sister. This consideration made them far
from being content, though they were arrived at the utmost height
of their late wishes, and much beyond their hopes. They gave
themselves up to an excess of jealousy, which not only disturbed
their joy, but was the cause of great troubles and afflictions to
the queen consort their younger sister. They had not an
opportunity to communicate their thoughts to each other on the
preference the emperor had given her, but were altogether
employed in preparing themselves for the celebration of their
marriages. Some days afterwards, when they had an opportunity of
seeing each other at the public baths, the eldest said to the
other, "Well, what say you to our sister's great fortune? Is not
she a fine person to be a queen!" "I must own," said the other
sister, "I cannot conceive what charms the emperor could discover
to be so bewitched by the young gipsy. Was it a reason sufficient
for him not to cast his eyes on you, because she was somewhat
younger? You were as worthy of his bed; and in justice he ought
to have preferred you."</p>

<p id="id03870">"Sister," said the elder, "I should not have regretted if his
majesty had but pitched upon you; but that he should choose that
hussy really grieves me. But I will revenge myself; and you, I
think, are as much concerned as me; therefore I propose that we
should contrive measures, and act in concert in a common cause:
communicate to me what you think the likeliest way to mortify
her, while I, on my side, will inform you what my desire of
revenge shall suggest to me."</p>

<p id="id03871">After this wicked agreement, the two sisters saw each other
frequently, and consulted how they might disturb and interrupt
the happiness of the queen. They proposed a great many ways, but
in deliberating about the manner of executing them, found so many
difficulties, that they durst not attempt them. In the mean time,
they often went together to make her visits with a detestable
dissimulation, and every time shewed her all the marks of
affection they could devise, to persuade her how overjoyed they
were to have a sister raised to so high a fortune. The queen, on
her part, constantly received them with all the demonstrations of
esteem they could expect: from a sister who was not puffed up
with her high dignity, and loved them as cordially as before.</p>

<p id="id03872">Some months after her marriage, the queen found herself to be
with child. The emperor expressed great joy, which was
communicated to all the court, and spread throughout the empire
of Persia. Upon this news the two sisters came to pay their
compliments, and proffered their service to deliver her, desiring
her, if not provided with a midwife, to accept of them.</p>

<p id="id03873">The queen said to them most obligingly, "Sisters, I should desire
nothing more, if it was absolutely in my power to make the
choice. I am however obliged to you for your good-will, but must
submit to what the emperor shall order on this occasion. Let your
husbands employ their friends to make interest, and get some
courtier to ask this favour of his majesty; and if he speaks to
me about it, be assured that I shall not only express the
pleasure he does me, but thank him for making choice of you."</p>

<p id="id03874">The two husbands applied themselves to some courtiers their
patrons, and begged of them to use their interest to procure
their wives the honour they aspired to. Those patrons exerted
themselves so much in their behalf, that the emperor promised
them to consider of the matter, and was as good as his word; for
in conversation with the queen, he told her, that he thought her
sisters were the most proper persons to assist her in her labour;
but would not name them before he had asked her consent. The
queen, sensible of the deference the emperor so obligingly paid
her, said to him, "Sir, I was prepared to do as your majesty
might please to command. But since you have been so kind as to
think of my sisters, I thank you for the regard you have shewn
them for my sake; and therefore I shall not dissemble, that I had
rather have them than strangers."</p>

<p id="id03875">The emperor named the queen's two sisters to be her midwives; and
from that time they went frequently to the palace, overjoyed at
the opportunity they should have of executing the detestable
wickedness they had meditated against the queen.</p>

<p id="id03876">When the queen's time was up she was safely delivered of a young
prince, as bright as the day; but neither his innocence nor
beauty could move the cruel hearts of the merciless sisters. They
wrapped him up carelessly in his cloths, and put him into a
basket, which they abandoned to the stream of a small canal, that
ran under the queen's apartment, and declared that she was
delivered of a little dead dog, which they produced. This
disagreeable intelligence was announced to the emperor, who
became so angry at the circumstance, that he was likely to have
occasioned the queen's death, if his grand vizier had not
represented to him, that he could not, without injustice, make
her answerable for the caprices of nature.</p>

<p id="id03877">In the mean time, the basket in which the little prince was
exposed was carried by the stream beyond a wall, which bounded
the prospect of the queen's apartment, and from thence floated
with the current down the gardens. By chance the intendant of the
emperor's gardens, one of the principal and most considerable
officers of the kingdom, was walking in the garden by the side of
this canal, and perceiving a basket floating, called to a
gardener, who was not far off, to bring it to shore, that he
might see what it contained. The gardener, with a rake which he
had in his hand, drew the basket to the side of the canal, took
it up, and gave it to him.</p>

<p id="id03878">The intendant of the gardens was extremely surprised to see in
the basket a child, which, though he knew it could be but just
born, had very fine features. This officer had been married
several years, but though he had always been desirous of having
children, Heaven had never blessed him with any. This accident
interrupted his walk: he made the gardener follow him with the
child; and when he came to his own house, which was situated at
the entrance into the gardens of the palace, went into his wife's
apartment. "Wife," said he, "as we have no children of our own,
God has sent us one. I recommend him to you; provide him a nurse,
and take as much care of him as if he were our own son; for, from
this moment, I acknowledge him as such." The intendant's wife
received the child with great joy, and took particular pleasure
in the care of him. The intendant himself would not inquire too
narrowly whence the child came. He saw plainly it came not far
off the queen's apartment; but it was not his business to examine
too closely into what had passed, nor to create disturbances in a
place where peace was so necessary.</p>

<p id="id03879">The following year the queen consort was brought to bed of
another prince, on whom the unnatural sisters had no more
compassion than on his brother; but exposed him likewise in a
basket, and set him adrift in the canal, pretending this time
that the sultaness was delivered of a cat. It was happy also for
this child that the intendant of the gardens was walking by the
canal side, who had it carried to his wife, and charged her to
take as much care of it as of the former; which was as agreeable
to her inclination as it was to that of the intendant.</p>

<p id="id03880">The emperor of Persia was more enraged this time against the
queen than before, and she had felt the effects of his anger if
the grand vizier's remonstrances had not prevailed.</p>

<p id="id03881">The third time the queen lay in she was delivered of a princess,
which innocent babe underwent the same fate as the princes her
brothers; for the two sisters being determined not to desist from
their detestable schemes, till they had seen the queen their
younger sister at least cast off, turned out, and humbled,
exposed this infant also on the canal. But the princess, as well
as the two princes her brothers, was preserved from death by the
compassion and charity of the intendant of the gardens.</p>

<p id="id03882">To this inhumanity the two sisters added a lie and deceit as
before. They produced a piece of wood, and affirmed it to be a
false birth of which the queen had been delivered.</p>

<p id="id03883">Khoosroo Shaw could no longer contain himself, when he was
informed of the new extraordinary birth. "What!" said he; "this
woman, unworthy of my bed, will fill my palace with monsters, if
I let her live any longer! No, it shall not be; she is a monster
herself, and I must rid the world of her." He pronounced sentence
of death, and ordered the grand vizier to see it executed.</p>

<p id="id03884">The grand vizier and the courtiers who were present cast
themselves at the emperor's feet, to beg of him to revoke the
sentence. "Your majesty, I hope, will give me leave," said the
grand vizier, "to represent to you, that the laws which condemn
persons to death were made to punish crimes; the three
extraordinary labours of the queen are not crimes; for in what
can she be said to have contributed towards them? Many other
women have had, and have the same every day, and are to be
pitied, but not punished. Your majesty may abstain from seeing
her, but let her live. The affliction in which she will spend the
rest of her life, after the loss of your favour, will be a
punishment sufficiently distressing."</p>

<p id="id03885">The emperor of Persia considered with himself, and reflecting
that it was unjust to condemn the queen to death for what had
happened, said, "Let her live then; I will spare her life; but it
shall be on this condition, that she shall desire to die more
than once every day. Let a wooden shed be built for her at the
gate of the principal mosque, with iron bars to the windows, and
let her be put into it, in the coarsest habit; and every
Mussulmaun that shall go into the mosque to prayers shall spit in
her face. If any one fail, I will have him exposed to the same
punishment; and that I maybe punctually obeyed, I charge you,
vizier, to appoint persons to see this done."</p>

<p id="id03886">The emperor pronounced his sentence in such a tone that the grand
vizier durst not further remonstrate; and it was executed, to the
great satisfaction of the two envious sisters. A shed was built,
and the queen, truly worthy of compassion, was put into it, and
exposed ignominiously to the contempt of the people; which usage,
as she did not deserve it, she bore with a patient resignation
that excited the admiration as well as compassion of those who
judged of things better than the vulgar.</p>

<p id="id03887">The two princes and the princess were, in the mean time, nursed
and brought up by the intendant of the gardens and his wife with
all the tenderness of a father and mother; and as they advanced
in age, they all shewed marks of superior dignity, but the
princess in particular, which discovered itself every day by
their docility and inclinations above trifles, different from
those of common children, and by a certain air which could only
belong to exalted birth. All this increased the affections of the
intendant and his wife, who called the eldest prince Bahman, and
the second Perviz, both of them names of the most ancient
emperors of Persia, and the princess, Perie-zadeh, which name
also had been borne by several queens and princesses of the
kingdom.</p>

<p id="id03888">As soon as the two princes were old enough, the intendant
provided proper masters to teach them to read and write; and the
princess their sister, who was often with them, shewing a great
desire to learn, the intendant, pleased with her quickness,
employed the same master to teach her also. Her emulation,
vivacity, and piercing wit, made her in a little time as great a
proficient as her brothers.</p>

<p id="id03889">From that time the brothers and sister had the same masters in
geography, poetry, history, and even the secret sciences; and
made so wonderful a progress, that their tutors were amazed, and
frankly owned that they could teach them no farther. At the hours
of recreation, the princess learned to sing and play upon all
sorts of instruments; and when the princes were learning to ride
she would not permit them to have that advantage over her, but
went through all the exercises with them, learning to ride also,
to bend the bow, and dart the reed or javelin, and often-times
outdid them in the race, and other contests of agility.</p>

<p id="id03890">The intendant of the gardens was so overjoyed to find his adopted
children so accomplished in all the perfections of body and mind,
and that they so well requited the expense he had been at in
their education, that he resolved to be at a still greater: for
as he had till then been content only with his lodge at the
entrance of the garden, and kept no country house, he purchased a
country seat at a short distance from the city, surrounded by a
large tract of arable land, meadows, and woods. As the house was
not sufficiently handsome nor convenient, he pulled it down, and
spared no expense in building a mansion more magnificent. He went
every day to hasten, by his presence, the great number of workmen
he employed; and as soon as there was an apartment ready to
receive him, passed several days together there when his presence
was not necessary at court; and by the same exertions, the
interior was furnished in the richest manner, answerably to the
magnificence of the edifice. Afterwards he made gardens,
according to a plan drawn by himself. He took in a large extent
of ground, which he walled round, and stocked with fallow deer,
that the princes and princess might divert themselves with
hunting when they chose.</p>

<p id="id03891">When this country seat was finished and fit for habitation, the
intendant of the gardens went and cast himself at the emperor's
feet, and after representing how long he had served, and the
infirmities of age which he found growing upon him, begged he
would permit him to resign his charge into his majesty's
disposal, and retire. The emperor gave him leave, with the more
pleasure because he was satisfied with his long services, both in
his father's reign and his own; and when he granted it, asked
what he should do to recompense him? "Sir," replied the intendant
of the gardens, "I have received so many obligations from your
majesty and the late emperor your father of happy memory, that I
desire no more than the honour of dying in your favour."</p>

<p id="id03892">He took his leave of the emperor, and retired with the two
princes and the princess to the country retreat he had built. His
wife had been dead some years, and he himself had not lived above
six months with them before he was surprised by so sudden a
death, that he had not time to give them the least account of the
manner in which he had discovered them.</p>

<p id="id03893">The princes Bahman and Perviz, and the princess Perie-zadeh, who
knew no other father than the intendant of the emperor's gardens,
regretted and bewailed him as such, and paid all the honours in
his funeral obsequies which love and filial gratitude required of
them. Satisfied with the plentiful fortune he had left them, they
lived together in perfect union, free from the ambition of
distinguishing themselves at court, or aspiring to places of
honour and dignity, which they might easily have obtained.</p>

<p id="id03894">One day when the two princes were hunting, and the princess had
remained at home, a religious old woman came to the gate, and
desired leave to go in to say her prayers, it being then the
hour. The servants asked the princess's permission, who ordered
them to shew her into the oratory, which the intendant of the
emperor's gardens had taken care to fit up in his house, for want
of a mosque in the neighbourhood. She bade them also, after the
good woman had finished her prayers, shew her the house and
gardens, and then bring her to her.</p>

<p id="id03895">The old woman went into the oratory, said her prayers, and when
she came out two of the princess's women invited her to see the
house and gardens; which civility she accepted, followed them
from one apartment to another, and observed, like a person who
understood what belonged to furniture, the nice arrangement of
every thing. They conducted her also into the garden, the
disposition of which she found so well planned, that she admired
it, observing that the person who had formed it must have been an
excellent master of his art. Afterwards she was brought before
the princess, who waited for her in the great hall, which in
beauty and richness exceeded all that she had admired in the
other apartments.</p>

<p id="id03896">As soon as the princess saw the devout woman, she said to her,
"My good mother, come near and sit down by me. I am overjoyed at
the happiness of having the opportunity of profiting for some
moments by the good example and conversation of such a person as
you, who have taken the right way by dedicating yourself to the
service of God. I wish every one were as wise."</p>

<p id="id03897">The devout woman, instead of sitting on a sofa, would only sit
upon the edge of one. The princess would not permit her to do so,
but rising from her seat,'and taking her by the hand, obliged her
to come and sit by her. The good woman, sensible of the civility,
said, "Madam, I ought not to have so much respect shewn me; but
since you command, and are mistress of your own house, I will
obey you." When she had seated herself, before they entered into
any conversation, one of the princess's women brought a little
low stand of mother of pearl and ebony, with a china dish full of
cakes upon it, and many others set round it full of fruits in
season, and wet and dry sweetmeats.</p>

<p id="id03898">The princess took up one of the cakes, and presenting her with
it, said, "Eat, good mother, and make choice of what you like
best; you had need to eat after coming so far." "Madam," replied
the good woman, "I am not used to eat such delicacies; but will
not refuse what God has sent me by so liberal a hand as yours."</p>

<p id="id03899">While the devout woman was eating, the princess ate a little too,
to bear her company, and asked her many questions upon the
exercise of devotion which she practised, and how she lived: all
which she answered with great modesty. Talking of several things,
at last she asked her what she thought of the house, and how she
liked it.</p>

<p id="id03900">"Madam," answered the devout woman, "I must certainly have very
bad taste to disapprove any thing in it, since it is beautiful,
regular, and magnificently furnished with exactness and judgment,
and all its ornaments adjusted in the best manner. Its situation
is an agreeable spot, and no garden can be more delightful; but
yet if you will give me leave to speak my mind freely, I will
take the liberty to tell you, that this house would be
incomparable if it had three things which are wanting to complete
it." "My good mother," replied the princess Perie-zadeh, "what are
those? I conjure you, in God's name, to tell me what they are: I
will spare nothing to get them, if it be possible."</p>

<p id="id03901">"Madam," replied the devout woman, "the first of these three
things is the speaking bird, so singular a creature, that it
draws round it all the singing birds of the neighbourhood, which
come to accompany his song. The second is the singing tree, the
leaves of which are so many mouths, which form an harmonious
concert of different voices, and never cease. The third is the
yellow water of a gold colour, a single drop of which being
poured into a vessel properly prepared, it increases so as to
fill it immediately, and rises up in the middle like a fountain,
which continually plays, and yet the basin never overflows."</p>

<p id="id03902">"Ah! my good mother," cried the princess, "how much am I obliged
to you for the knowledge of these curiosities! They are
surprising, and I never before heard there were such wonderful
rarities in the world; but as I am persuaded that you know, I
expect that you should do me the favour to inform me where they
are to be found."</p>

<p id="id03903">"Madam," replied the good woman, "I should be unworthy the
hospitality you have with so much goodness shewn me, if I should
refuse to satisfy your curiosity in that point; and am glad to
have the honour to tell you, that these curiosities are all to be
met with in the same spot on the confines of this kingdom,
towards India. The road to it lies before your house, and whoever
you send needs but follow it for twenty days, and on the
twentieth let him only ask the first person he meets where the
speaking bird, singing tree, and yellow water are, and he will be
informed." After saying this, she rose from her seat, took her
leave, and went her way.</p>

<p id="id03904">The princess Perie-zadeh's thoughts were so taken up with what
the devout woman had told her of the speaking bird, singing tree,
and yellow water, that she never perceived her departure, till
she wanted to ask her some question for her better information;
for she thought that what she had told her was not a sufficient
reason for exposing herself by undertaking a long journey,
possibly to no purpose. However, she would not send after her,
but endeavoured to remember all she had told her; and when she
thought she had recollected every word, took real pleasure in
thinking of the satisfaction she should have if she could get
these wonderful curiosities into her possession; but the
difficulties she apprehended, and the fear of not succeeding,
made her very uneasy.</p>

<p id="id03905">She was absorbed in these thoughts when her brothers returned
from hunting; who, when they entered the great hall, instead of
finding her lively and gay, as she used to be be, were amazed to
see her so pensive, and hanging down her head as if something
troubled her.</p>

<p id="id03906">"Sister," said prince Bahman, "what is become of all your mirth
and gaiety? Are you not well? or has some misfortune befallen
you? Has any body given you reason to be so melancholy? Tell us,
that we may know how to act, and give you some relief. If any one
has affronted you, we will resent his insolence."</p>

<p id="id03907">The princess remained in the same posture some time without
answering; but at last lifted up her eyes to look at her
brothers, and then held them down again, telling them nothing
disturbed her.</p>

<p id="id03908">"Sister," said prince Bahman, "you conceal the truth from us;
there must be something of consequence. It is impossible we could
observe so sudden a change if nothing was the matter with you.
You would not have us satisfied with the evasive answer you have
given: do not conceal any thing, unless you would have us suspect
that you renounce the strict union which has hitherto subsisted
between us from our infancy."</p>

<p id="id03909">The princess, who had not the smallest intention to offend her
brothers, would not suffer them to entertain such a thought, but
said, "When I told you nothing disturbed me, I meant nothing that
was of importance to you; but to me it is of some consequence;
and since you press me to tell you by our strict union and
friendship, which are so dear to me, I will. You think, and I
always believed so too, that this house was so complete that
nothing was wanting. But this day I have learned that it wants
three rarities, which would render it so perfect that no country
seat in the world could be compared with it. These three things
are, the speaking bird, the singing tree, and the yellow water.
After she had informed them wherein consisted the excellency of
these rarities," "A devout woman," added she, "has made this
discovery to me, told me the place where they are to be found,
and the way thither. Perhaps you may imagine these things to be
trifles, and of little consequence to render our house complete,
that without these additions it will always be thought
sufficiently elegant with what it already contains, and that we
can do without them. You may think as you please; but I cannot
help telling you that I am persuaded they are absolutely
necessary, and I shall not be easy without them. Therefore,
whether you value them or not, I desire you to consider what
person you may think proper for me to send in search of the
curiosities I have mentioned."</p>

<p id="id03910">"Sister," replied prince Bahman, "nothing can concern you in
which we have not an equal interest. It is enough that you have
an earnest desire for the things you mention to oblige us to take
the same interest; but if you had not, we feel ourselves inclined
of our own accord and for our own individual satisfaction. I am
persuaded my brother is of the same opinion, and therefore we
ought to undertake this conquest; for the importance and
singularity of the undertaking deserve that name. I will take
that charge upon myself; only tell me the place, and the way to
it, and I will defer my journey no longer than till to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id03911">"Brother," said prince Perviz, "it is not proper that you, who
are the head and director of our family, should be absent. I
desire my sister would join with me to oblige you to abandon your
design, and allow me to undertake it. I hope to acquit myself as
well as you, and it will be a more regular proceeding." "I am
persuaded of your good-will, brother," replied prince Bahman,
"and that you would succeed as well as myself in this journey;
but I have resolved, and will undertake it. You shall stay at
home with our sister, and I need not recommend her to you." He
spent the remainder of the day in making preparations for his
journey, and informing himself from the princess of the
directions which the devout woman had left her.</p>

<p id="id03912">The next morning Bahman mounted his horse, and Perviz and the
princess embraced, and wished him a good journey. But in the
midst of their adieus, the princess recollected what she had not
thought of before. "Brother," said she, "I had quite forgotten
the accidents which attend travellers. Who knows whether I shall
ever see you again? Alight, I beseech you, and give up this
journey. I would rather be deprived of the sight and possession
of the speaking bird, singing tree, and yellow water, than run
the risk of never seeing you more."</p>

<p id="id03913">"Sister," replied Bahman, smiling at the sudden fears of the
princess, "my resolution is fixed, but were it not, I should
determine upon it now, and you must allow me to execute it. The
accidents you speak of befall only those who are unfortunate; but
there are more who are not so. However, as events are uncertain,
and I may fail in this undertaking, all I can do is to leave you
this knife."</p>

<p id="id03914">Bahman, pulling a knife from his vestband, and presenting it in
the sheath to the princess, said, "Take this knife, sister, and
give yourself the trouble sometimes to pull it out of the sheath:
while you see it clean as it is now, it will be a sign that I am
alive; but if you find it stained with blood, then you may
believe me dead, and indulge me with your prayers."</p>

<p id="id03915">The princess could obtain nothing more of Bahman. He bade adieu
to her and prince Perviz for the last time, and rode away. When
he got into the road he never turned to the right hand nor to the
left, but went directly forward towards India. The twentieth day
he perceived on the road side a hideous old man, who sat under a
tree some small distance from a thatched house, which was his
retreat from the weather.</p>

<p id="id03916">His eye-brows were as white as snow, as was also the hair of his
head; his whiskers covered his mouth, and his beard and hair
reached down to his feet. The nails of his hands and feet were
grown to an extensive length; a flat broad umbrella covered his
head. He had no clothes, but only a mat thrown round his body.</p>

<p id="id03917">This old man was a dervish, for many years retired from the
world, to give himself up entirely to the service of God; so that
at last he became what we have described.</p>

<p id="id03918">Prince Bahman, who had been all that morning very attentive to
see if he could meet with any body who could give him information
of the place he was in search of, stopped when he came near the
dervish, alighted, in conformity to the directions which the
devout woman had given the princess Perie-zadeh, and leading his
horse by the bridle, advanced towards him, and saluting him,
said, "God prolong your days, good father, and grant you the
accomplishment of your desires."</p>

<p id="id03919">The dervish returned the prince's salutation, but so
unintelligibly that he could not understand one word he said:
prince Bahman perceiving that this difficulty proceeded from the
dervish's whiskers hanging over his mouth, and unwilling to go
any farther without the instructions he wanted, pulled out a pair
of scissors he had about him, and having tied his horse to a
branch of the tree, said, "Good dervish, I want to have some talk
with you: but your whiskers prevent my understanding what you
say: and if you will consent, I will cut off some part of them
and of your eye-brows, which disfigure you so much that you look
more like a bear than a man."</p>

<p id="id03920">The dervish did not oppose the offer; and when the prince had cut
off as much hair as he thought fit, he perceived that the dervish
had a good complexion, and that he did not seem so old as he
really was. "Good dervish," said he, "if I had a glass I would
shew you how young you look: you are now a man, but before nobody
could tell what you were."</p>

<p id="id03921">The kind behaviour of prince Bahman made the dervish smile, and
return his compliment. "Sir," said he, "whoever you are, I am
obliged by the good office you have performed, and am ready to
shew my gratitude by doing any thing in my power for you. You
must have alighted here upon some account or other. Tell me what
it is, and I will endeavour to serve you."</p>

<p id="id03922">"Good dervish," replied prince Bahman, "I am in search of the
speaking bird, the singing tree, and the yellow water; I know
these three rarities are not far from hence, but cannot tell
exactly the place where they are to be found; if you know, I
conjure you to shew me the way, that I may not lose my labour
after so long a journey."</p>

<p id="id03923">The prince, while he spoke, observed that the dervish changed
countenance, held down his eyes, looked very serious, and instead
of making any reply, remained silent; which obliged him to say to
him again, "Good father, I fancy you heard me; tell me whether
you know what I ask you, that I may not lose my time, but inform
myself somewhere else."</p>

<p id="id03924">At last the dervish broke silence. "Sir," said he to prince
Bahman, "I know the way you ask of me; but the regard which I
conceived for you the first moment I saw you, and which is grown
stronger by the service you have done me, kept me in suspense,
whether I should give you the satisfaction you desire." "What
motive can hinder you?" replied the prince; "and what
difficulties do you find in so doing?" "I will tell you," replied
the dervish; "the danger you are going to expose yourself to is
greater than you may suppose. A number of gentlemen of as much
bravery and courage as you can possibly possess have passed this
way, and asked me the same question. When I had used all my
endeavours to persuade them to desist, they would not believe me;
at last, I yielded, to their importunities; I was compelled to
shew them the way, and I can assure you they have all perished,
for I have not seen one come back. Therefore, if you have any
regard for your life, take my advice, go no farther, but return
home."</p>

<p id="id03925">Prince Bahman persisted in his resolution. "I will not suppose,"
said he to the dervish, "but that your advice is sincere. I am
obliged to you for the friendship you express for me; but
whatever may be the danger, nothing shall make me change my
intention: whoever attacks me, I am well armed, and can say I am
as brave as any one." "But they who will attack you are not to be
seen," replied the dervish; "how will you defend yourself against
invisible persons?" "It is no matter," answered the prince; "all
you say shall not persuade me to do any thing contrary to my
duty. Since you know the way, I conjure you once more to inform
me."</p>

<p id="id03926">When the dervish found he could not prevail upon prince Bahman,
and that he was obstinately bent to pursue his journey
notwithstanding his friendly remonstrance, he put his hand into a
bag that lay by him and pulled out a bowl, which he presented to
him. "Since I cannot prevail on you to attend to my advice," said
he, "take this bowl; when you are on horseback throw it before
you, and follow it to the foot of a mountain, where it will stop.
As soon as the bowl stops, alight, leave your horse with the
bridle over his neck, and he will stand in the same place till
you return. As you ascend you will see on your right and left a
great number of large black stones, and will hear on all sides a
confusion of voices, which will utter a thousand injurious abuses
to discourage you, and prevent your reaching the summit of the
mountain. Be not afraid; but above all things, do not turn your
head to look behind you; for in that instant you will be changed
into such a black stone as those you see, which are all youths
who have failed in this enterprise. If you escape the danger of
which I give you but a faint idea, and get to the top of the
mountain, you will see a cage, and in that cage is the bird you
seek; ask him which are the singing tree and the yellow water,
and he will tell you. I have nothing more to say; this is what
you have to do, and the danger you have to avoid; but if you are
prudent, you will take my advice, and not expose your life.
Consider once more while you have time that the difficulty is
almost insuperable."</p>

<p id="id03927">"I am obliged to you for your repeated advice," replied prince
Bahman, after he had received the bowl, "but cannot follow it.
However, I will endeavour to conform myself to that part of it
which bids me not look behind me as I shall ascend the mountain,
and I hope to come and see you again soon, and thank you when I
have obtained what I am seeking." After these words, to which the
dervish made no other answer than that he should be overjoyed to
see him again, the prince mounted his horse, took his leave of
the dervish with a respectful salute, and threw the bowl before
him.</p>

<p id="id03928">The bowl rolled away unceasingly with as much swiftness as when
prince Bahman first hurled it from his hand, which obliged him to
put his horse to the same pace to avoid losing sight of it, and
when it had reached the foot of the mountain it stopped. The
prince alighted from his horse, laid the bridle on his neck; and
having first surveyed the mountain, and seen the black stones,
began to ascend; but had not gone four steps, before he heard the
voices mentioned by the dervish, though he could see nobody. Some
said, "Where is that fool going? where is he going? what would he
have? do not let him pass." Others, "Stop him, catch him, kill
him;" and others with a voice like thunder, "Thief! assassin!
murderer!" while some in a gibing tone cried, "No, no, do not
hurt him; let the pretty fellow pass, the cage and bird are kept
for him."</p>

<p id="id03929">Notwithstanding all these troublesome voices, prince Bahman
ascended with courage and resolution for some time, but the
voices redoubled with so loud a din near him, both behind and
before, that at last he was seized with dread, his legs trembled
under him, he staggered, and finding that his strength failed
him, he forgot the dervish's advice, turned about to run down the
hill, and was that instant changed into a black stone; a
metamorphosis which had happened to many before him, who had
attempted the ascent. His horse likewise underwent the same
change.</p>

<p id="id03930">From the time of prince Bahman's departure, the princess Perie-zadeh
always wore the knife and sheath in her girdle, and pulled it out
several times in a day, to know whether her brother was alive. She had
the consolation to understand he was in perfect health, and to talk of
him frequently with prince Perviz, who sometimes prevented her by
asking her what news.</p>

<p id="id03931">On the fatal day that prince Bahman was transformed into a stone,
as prince Perviz and the princess were talking together in the
evening, as usual, the prince desired his sister to pull out the
knife to know how their brother did. The princess readily
complied, and seeing the blood run down the point was seized with
so much horror that she threw it down. "Ah! my dear brother,"
cried she, "I have been the cause of your death, and shall never
see you more! Why did I tell you of the speaking bird, singing
tree, and yellow water; or rather, of what importance was it to
me to know whether the devout woman thought this house ugly or
handsome, or complete or not? I wish to Heaven she had never
addressed herself to me? Deceitful hypocrite!" added she, "is
this the return you have made for the kind reception I gave you?
Why did you tell me of a bird, a tree, and a water, which,
imaginary as I am persuaded they are, by my dear brother's death,
yet disturb me by your enchantment?"</p>
