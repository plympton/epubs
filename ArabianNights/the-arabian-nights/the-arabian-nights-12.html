<h2 id="id04240" style="margin-top: 4em">            THE SULTAN AND THE TRAVELLER MHAMOOD AL
                           HYJEMMEE.</h2>

<p id="id04241" style="margin-top: 3em">There was a sultan, who one evening being somewhat low-spirited,
sent for his vizier, and said, "I know not the cause, but my mind
is uneasy, and I want something to divert it." "If so," replied
the vizier, "I have a friend, named Mhamood al Hyjemmee, a
celebrated traveller, who has witnessed many wonderful
occurrences, and can relate a variety of astonishing narratives.
Shall I send for him to the presence?" "By all means," answered
the sultan, "that I may hear his relations." The minister
departed, and informed his friend that the sultan desired to see
him. "To hear is to obey," replied Mhamood, and hastened with the
vizier to the palace.</p>

<p id="id04242">When they had entered the palace, Mhamood made the obeisance
usual to the caliphs, and uttered a poetical invocation for the
prosperity of the sultan, who returned his salute; and after
desiring him to be seated, said, "Mhamood, my mind is uneasy, and
as I hear you are acquainted with many curious events, I wish you
to relate some of them to amuse me." Mhamood replied, "To hear is
to obey;" and thus began an adventure of his own.</p>

<p id="id04243" style="margin-top: 4em">                          The Koord Robber.</p>

<p id="id04244" style="margin-top: 3em">Some years ago I took a journey from my own country to the land
of Yemen, accompanied by a slave, who was a lad of much ready
wit, and who carried a wallet containing a few necessaries. As we
were entering a town, a rascally koord snatched the wallet from
his hands, and asserted that it was his own, which we had stolen
from him: upon which, I called out to some passengers to assist
me in the recovery of my property, and they helped me to carry
the sharper before the cauzee, to whom I complained of his
assault. The magistrate asked the koord what he had to allege in
his defence; to which he replied, "My lord, I lost this wallet
some days since, and found it in possession of the complainant,
who pretends that it is his own, and will not resign it." "If it
be thine," rejoined the cauzee, "describe to me what it contains,
when I shall be satisfied that thou speakest the truth."</p>

<p id="id04245">The koord assented, and with a loud voice cried out, "In this
wallet, my lord, are two chests, in which are collyrium for the
eyes, a number of rich napkins, drinking vessels of gold, lamps,
cooking utensils, dishes, basins, and ewers; also bales of
merchandize, jewels, gold, silks, and other precious articles,
with a variety of wearing apparel, carpets, cushions, eating
cloths, and other things too tedious to enumerate; besides, I can
bring a number of my brother koords to testify to the truth of
what I have said, and that the wallet is mine."</p>

<p id="id04246">When the koord had finished, the cauzee smiled, and asked me and
my slave what we could describe to be in the wallet: upon which,
my slave said, "My lord, there is nothing in it of what the koord
has mentioned, for it contains only both worlds, with all their
lands, seas, cities, habitations, men, animals, and productions
of every kind." The cauzee laughed, and turning to the koord,
said, "Friend, thou hast heard what has past; what further canst
thou say?" "The bag is mine," continued the koord: upon which,
the cauzee ordered it to be emptied; when, lo! there were found
in it some cakes of bread, a few limes, a little pepper, and a
cruet of oil. Seeing this, the koord exclaimed, "Pardon me, my
lord the cauzee, I have been mistaken, the wallet is not mine;
but I must away and search for the thief who has stolen my
valuable property." Having said this, he ran off, leaving the
cauzee, myself, and the spectators bursting with laughter at his
impudent knavery.</p>

<p id="id04247">The sultan was much diverted with the relation of Mhamood, and
requested him to relate another story, which he did as follows.</p>

<p id="id04248" style="margin-top: 4em">                     Story of the Husbandman.</p>

<p id="id04249" style="margin-top: 3em">A certain husbandman having reared some choice vegetables and
fruits earlier than usual, resolved to present them to the
sultan, in hopes of receiving a handsome present. He accordingly
loaded his ass and set off for the capital, on the road to which
he met the sultan, whom he had never before seen; and who being
on a hunting excursion had separated from his attendants. The
sultan inquired where he was going, and what he carried. "I am
repairing," said the husbandman, "to our lord the sultan, in
hopes that he will reward me with a handsome price for my fruits
and vegetables, which I have reared earlier than usual." "What
dost thou mean to ask him?" replied the sultan. "A thousand
deenars," answered the husbandman; "which if he refuses to give,
I will demand five hundred; should he think that sum too much, I
will come down to two hundred; and if he declines to give so
much, I will ask thirty deenars, from which price I will not
depart."</p>

<p id="id04250">The sultan now left the husbandman, and hastening to the city,
entered the palace, where the latter soon after arrived with his
fruits, and was introduced to the presence. Having made his
obeisance, the sultan returning his salute, said, "Father, what
hast thou brought with thee?" "Fruits, reared earlier than
usual," answered the husbandman: to which the sultan replied,
"They are acceptable," and uncovering them, sent a part by the
eunuchs into his haram, and distributed the rest to his
courtiers, excepting a few which he ate himself, talking all the
while to the countryman, whose sensible remarks gave him much
pleasure. He presented him with two hundred deenars, and the
ladies of the haram sent him a present of half that sum. The
sultan then desired him to return home, give the money to his
family, and come back with speed, as he wished to enjoy his
conversation. The husbandman having replied, "To hear is to
obey," blessed the sultan for his bounty, and hastening home gave
the deenars to his wife, informing her that he was invited to
spend the evening at court, and took his leave. It was sunset
when he arrived at the palace, and the sultan being at his
evening meal invited him to partake. When they were satisfied,
they performed their ablutions, and having said the evening
prayer, and read a portion of the Koraun, the sultan, desiring
him to be seated, commanded the husbandman to relate him some
narrative. The husbandman being seated, thus began.</p>

<p id="id04251" style="margin-top: 4em">           Story of the Three Princes and Enchanting Bird.</p>

<p id="id04252" style="margin-top: 3em">It has been lately related that there was formerly a sovereign of
the East who had three sons, the eldest of whom had heard some
traveller describe a particular country where there was a bird
called Bulbul al Syach, who transformed any passenger who came
near him into stone. The prince resolved to see this wonderful
bird; and requested leave to travel from his father, who
endeavoured in vain to divert him from his purpose. He took
leave, and on his departure, pulling off a ring set with a
magical gem, gave it to his second brother, saying, "Whenever you
perceive this ring press hard upon your finger, be assured that I
am lost beyond recovery." Having begun his journey, he did not
cease travelling till he reached the spot where was the bird's
cage, in which it used to pass the night, but in the daytime it
flew about for exercise and food.</p>

<p id="id04253">It was the custom of the bird to return about sunset to the cage;
when, if it perceived any person near, it would cry out in a
plaintive tone, "Who will say to a poor wanderer, Lodge? who will
say to an unhappy Bulbul, Lodge?" and if the person replied,
"Lodge, poor bird!" it immediately hovered over his head, and
scattering upon him some earth from its bill, the person became
transformed into a stone. Such proved the fate of the unfortunate
prince.</p>

<p id="id04254">The transformation of the eldest prince had no sooner taken place
than the ring pressed hard upon the finger of the second, who
exclaimed, "Alas! alas! my brother is lost; but I will travel,
and endeavour to find out his condition." It was in vain that the
sultan his father, and the sultana his mother, remonstrated. He
departed after he had delivered the magical ring to his younger
brother, and journeyed till he reached the cage of the bird; who
having ensnared him to pronounce the word lodge, scattered some
earth upon his head, when he, also, immediately became
transformed into stone.</p>

<p id="id04255">At this instant the youngest prince was sitting at a banquet with
his father; when the ring pressed so hard to his finger, as to
put him to much pain. He rose up, and exclaimed, "There is no
refuge or asylum but with God; for his we are, and to him we must
return." The sultan, upon this, inquired the cause of his grief;
when he said, "My brother has perished."</p>

<p id="id04256">The old sultan was loudly lamenting the loss of his two children,
when the youngest continued, "I will travel and learn the fate of
my brothers." "Alas!" said the father, "is it not enough that I
have lost them, but thou also wilt rush into destruction? I
entreat thee not to leave me." "Father," replied the prince,
"fate impels me to search for my brothers, whom, perhaps, I may
recover; but if I fail, I shall only have done my duty." Having
said this, he departed, in spite of the tears and lamentations of
his parents, and travelled till he had reached the residence of
the bird; where he found his brothers transformed into images of
stone. At sunset the bird began its usual tone; but the prince
suspecting some deceit, forbore to speak, till at length the
Bulbul retired to his cage, and fell asleep; when watching the
opportunity, the prince darted upon it, and fastened the door.
The bird awoke at the noise, and seeing himself caught, said,
"Thou hast won the prize, O glorious son of a mighty sultan!" "If
so," exclaimed the prince, "inform me by what means thou hast
enchanted so many persons as I see around me changed into images
of marble, and how I may release them from their unhappy state."
"Behold," replied the bird, "yonder two heaps of earth, one white
and the other blue. The blue enchants, and the other will recover
from transformation."</p>

<p id="id04257">The prince immediately took up handfuls of the white earth, and
scattering it over the numerous images, they instantly became
animated and restored to all their functions. He embraced his two
brothers, and received their thanks; also those of the sons of
many sultans, bashaws, and great personages, for giving them new
life. They informed him that near the spot was a city, all the
inhabitants of which had been, like them, transformed into stone.
To this he repaired, and having relieved them from their
enchantment, the people out of gratitude made him rich presents,
and would have chosen him for their sovereign, but he declined
their offer, and resolved to conduct his brothers in safety to
their father.</p>

<p id="id04258">The two elder princes, notwithstanding they owed the restoration
of their lives to their brother, became envious of the valuable
presents he had received, and of the fame he would acquire at
home for his achievement. They said to one another, "When we
reach the capital the people will applaud him, and say, 'Lo! the
two elder brothers have been rescued from destruction by the
youngest.'"</p>

<p id="id04259">The youngest prince being supplied with horses, camels, and
carriages, for himself and companions, began his march homewards,
and proceeded by easy stages towards the capital of his father;
within one day's journey of which was a reservoir of water lined
with marble. On the brink of this he ordered his tents to be
pitched, resolving to pass the night and enjoy himself in
feasting with his brothers. An elegant entertainment was
prepared, and he sat with them till it was time to repose; when
they retired to their tents, and he lay down to sleep, having on
his finger a ring, which he had found in the cage of the Bulbul.</p>

<p id="id04260">The envious brothers thinking this a fit opportunity to destroy
their generous preserver, arose in the dead of night, and taking
up the prince, cast him into the reservoir, and escaped to their
tents undiscovered. In the morning they issued orders of march,
the tents were struck, and the camels loaded; but the attendants
missing the youngest prince, inquired after him; to which the
brothers replied, that being asleep in his tent, they were
unwilling to disturb him. This satisfied them, and having pursued
their march they reached the capital of their father, who was
overjoyed at their return, and admired the beauty of the Bulbul,
which they had carried with them; but he inquired with eagerness
what was become of their brother.</p>

<p id="id04261">The brothers replied, "We know nothing of him, and did not till
now hear of his departure in search of the bird, which we have
brought with us." The sultan dearly loved his youngest son; and
on hearing that his brothers had not seen him, beat his hands
together, exclaiming, "Alas! alas! there is no refuge or asylum
but with the Almighty, from whom we came, and to whom we must
return."</p>

<p id="id04262">We must now return to the youngest brother. When he was cast into
the reservoir he awoke, and finding himself in danger, exclaimed,
"I seek deliverance from that God who relieveth his servants from
the snares of the wicked." His prayer was heard, and he reached
the bottom of the reservoir unhurt; where he seated himself on a
ledge, when he heard persons talking. One said to another, "Some
son of man is near." "Yes," replied the other, "he is the
youngest son of our virtuous sultan; who, after having delivered
his two brothers from enchantment, hath been treacherously cast
into this reservoir." "Well," answered the first voice, "he may
easily escape, for he has a ring upon his finger, which if he
will rub a genie will appear to him and perform whatever he may
command."</p>

<p id="id04263">The prince no sooner heard these words than he rubbed his hand
over the ring, when a good genie appearing, said, "Prince, what
are thy commands?"</p>

<p id="id04264">"I command," replied the prince, "that thou instantly prepare me
tents, camels, domestics, guards, and every thing suitable to my
condition." "All is ready," answered the genie; who, at the same
instant taking him from the ledge, conducted him into a splendid
encampment, where the troops received him with acclamations. He
ordered signals of march to be sounded, and proceeded towards the
capital of his father. When he had arrived near the city, he
commanded his tents to be pitched on the plain. Immediately his
orders were obeyed, the tents were raised (a most magnificent one
for himself), before which the servants raised a gorgeous awning,
and sprinkled water to lay the dust. The cooks lighted their
fires, and a great smoke ascended, which filled the plain.</p>

<p id="id04265">The inhabitants of the city were astonished at the approach of
the army, and when they saw the encampment pitched, supposed it
to be that of a powerful enemy preparing for assaulting them.
Intelligence of this unexpected host was conveyed to the sultan;
who, on hearing it, instead of alarm, felt a pleasure which he
could not account for, and said, "Gracious Allah! my heart is
filled with delight; but why I know not." Immediately he
commanded his suite to attend, and repaired to the encampment of
his son, to whom he was introduced; but the prince being habited
very richly, and differently from what he had seen him in, was
not known by the sultan.</p>

<p id="id04266">The prince received his father with the honours due to his rank,
and when they were seated, and had entered into conversation,
said, "What is become of thy youngest son?" The words were
scarcely uttered, when the old sultan fell fainting to the earth.
On his recovery, he exclaimed, "Alas! my son's imprudence led him
to travel, and he has fallen a prey to the beasts of the forest."
"Be comforted," replied the prince; "the disasters of fortune
have not reached thy son, for he is alive and in health." "Is it
possible?" cried the sultan; "ah! tell me where I shall find
him!" "He is before thee," replied the prince: upon which, the
sultan looking more closely, knew him, fell upon his neck, wept,
and sunk to the earth overpowered with ecstacy.</p>

<p id="id04267">When the sultan had recovered, he desired his son to relate his
adventures, which he did from first to last. Just as he had
finished the elder brothers arrived, and seeing him in such
splendour, hung down their heads, abashed and unable to speak;
but yet more envious than ever. The old sultan would have put
them to death for their treachery, but the youngest prince said,
"Let us leave them to the Almighty, for whoever commits sin will
meet its punishment in himself."</p>

<p id="id04268">When the husbandman had concluded the above story, the sultan was
so highly pleased that he presented him with a large sum of
money, and a beautiful slave, inquiring at the same time if he
could divert him with another story, to which he replied in the
affirmative.</p>

<p id="id04269">On another night, when the sultan and the countryman had sat down
to converse, the former desired him to relate some ancient story,
when the latter began as follows.</p>

<p id="id04270" style="margin-top: 4em">          Story of a Sultan of Yemen and his three Sons.</p>

<p id="id04271" style="margin-top: 3em">It has been related, that in the kingdom of Yemen there was a
sultan who had three sons, two of whom were born of the same
mother, and the third of another wife, with whom becoming
disgusted from some caprice, and having degraded her to the
station of a domestic, he suffered her and her son to live
unnoticed among the servants of the haram. The two former, one
day, addressed their father, requesting his permission to hunt:
upon which he presented them each with a horse of true blood,
richly caparisoned, and ordered proper domestics to attend them
to the chase.</p>

<p id="id04272">When they had departed, the unfortunate youngest brother repaired
to his unhappy mother, and expressed his wishes to enjoy, like
the elder princes, the pleasures of the field. "My son," replied
she, "it is not in my power to procure thee a horse or other
necessaries." Upon this he wept bitterly; when she gave him some
of her silver ornaments, which he took, and having sold them,
with the price purchased a foundered steed. Having mounted it,
and provided himself with some bread, he followed the track of
his brothers for two days, but on the third lost his way. After
wandering two days more he beheld upon the plain a string of
emeralds and pearls, which shone with great lustre. Having taken
it up, he wreathed it round his turban, and returned homewards
exulting in his prize; but when he had arrived near the city his
brothers met him, pulled him from his horse, beat him, and forced
it from him. He excelled them both in prowess and vigour, but he
was fearful of the sultan's displeasure, and his mother's safety,
should he punish his insulters. He therefore submitted to the
indignity and loss, and retired.</p>

<p id="id04273">The two cowardly princes entered the palace, and presented the
string of jewels to the sultan; who, after admiring it, said, "I
shall not rest satisfied till the bird arrives to whom this
certainly must have belonged:" upon which the brothers replied,
"We will travel in search of it, and bring it to our august
father and sultan."</p>

<p id="id04274">Preparations being made, the brothers departed, and the youngest
prince having mounted his lame steed followed them. After three
days' journey he reached an arid desert, which having passed over
by great exertion, he arrived almost exhausted at a city; which
on entering he found resounding with the shrieks of lamentation
and woe. At length he met with a venerable old man, to whom
having made a respectful salute, he inquired of him the cause of
such universal mourning. "My son," replied the old man, "on a
certain day during the last forty-three years, a terrible monster
has appeared before our city, demanding a beautiful virgin to be
delivered up to him, threatening to destroy it in case of
refusal. Unable to defend ourselves, we have complied with his
demand, and the damsels of the city have drawn lots for the
dreadful sacrifice; but this year the chance has fallen upon the
beautiful daughter of our sultan. This is the day of the
monster's usual arrival, and we are involved in universal
lamentation for her unhappy fate."</p>

<p id="id04275">When the young prince heard the above, he, under the direction of
the old man, repaired to the place of the monster's resort,
resolved to conquer him or die. Scarcely had he reached it, when
the princess approached it, splendidly habited, but with a
dejected head, and drowned in tears. He made a respectful salute,
which she returned, saying, "Hasten, young man, from this spot,
for a monster will soon appear, to whom, by my unhappy fate, I am
destined. Should he discover thee, he will tear thee in pieces."
"Princess," replied he, "I know the circumstance, and am resolved
to become a ransom for thy beauty."</p>

<p id="id04276">The prince had hardly uttered these words, when a column of dust
arose; from which with dreadful howlings and fury the monster
issued, lashing his gigantic sides with his thick tail. The
princess shrieked, and wept in the agonies of fear; but the
prince drawing his sabre, put himself in the way of the savage
monster; who, enraged, snorted fire from his wide nostrils, and
made a spring at the prince. The gallant youth with wonderful
agility evaded his talons, and darting from side to side of the
monster, watched his opportunity, till rushing upon him, he cleft
his head asunder just between his eyes, when the huge creature
fell down and growled his last in a tremendous roar.</p>

<p id="id04277">The princess, on seeing the monster expire, ran to her deliverer,
wiped the dust and sweat from his face with her veil, uttering
grateful thanks, to which he replied, "Return to thy lamenting
parents;" but she would not, and said, "My lord, and light of my
eyes, thou must be mine and I thine." "That is perhaps
impossible," rejoined the prince; and hastening from her, he
returned to the city, where he took up his lodging in an obscure
corner. She now repaired to the palace. On her entrance, the
sultan and her mother were astonished, and inquired in alarm the
cause of her return; fearing that she had escaped from the
monster, who would in revenge destroy the city.</p>

<p id="id04278">The princess related the story of her deliverance by a handsome
youth: upon which, the sultan, with his attendants, and most of
the inhabitants of the place, repaired to view the monster, whom
they found extended dead on the earth. The whole city was now
filled with grateful thanksgivings and universal rejoicing. The
sultan, eager to shew his gratitude to the gallant youth, said to
the princess, "Shouldst thou know thy deliverer wert thou to see
him again?" "Certainly!" replied she; for love had impressed his
image on her mind too strongly to be ever erased.</p>

<p id="id04279">The sultan, upon this, issued a proclamation, commanding every
male in the city to pass under the windows of his daughter's
apartment; which was done successively for three days; but she
did not recognize her beloved champion. The sultan then inquired
if all the men of the city had obeyed his commands, and was
informed that all had done so, except a young man at a certain
serai, who was a foreigner, and therefore had not attended. The
sultan ordered him to appear; and he had no sooner approached the
window than the princess threw down upon his head an embroidered
handkerchief, exclaiming, "This is our deliverer from the fangs
of the monster."</p>

<p id="id04280">The sultan now ordered the young prince to be introduced to his
presence, to which he advanced, making the obeisances customary
to royal personages in a graceful manner. "Art thou the destroyer
of the monster?" exclaimed the sultan. "I am," answered the
prince. "Tell me how I can reward thee?" replied the sultan. "My
request to God and your majesty," answered the prince, "is, that
the princess thy daughter may be given me in marriage." "Rather
ask me a portion of my treasures," rejoined the sultan. Upon
this, the officers of the court observed, that as he had saved
the princess from death, he was worthy of her; and the sultan at
length consenting, the marriage knot was tied. The young prince
received his bride, and the nuptials were consummated. Towards
the close of night he arose, and having taken off her ring, put
his own in its room on her finger, and wrote upon the palm of her
hand, "I am called Alla ad Deen, the son of a potent sultan, who
rules in Yemen; if thou canst come to me there, well; otherwise
remain with thy father."</p>

<p id="id04281">When the prince had done as above related, he left his bride
asleep, and quitting the palace and city, pursued his travels;
during which he married another wife, whom he had saved from an
elephant in a similar way: he left her in the same manner as the
first.</p>

<p id="id04282">When the prince had left his second wife, he proceeded in search
of the bird to whom the string of emeralds and pearls had
belonged, and at length reached the city of its mistress, who was
daughter to the sultan, a very powerful monarch. Having entered
the capital, he walked through several streets, till at last he
perceived a venerable old man, whose age seemed to be, at least,
that of a hundred years, sitting alone. He approached him, and
having paid his respects, sat down, and entering into
conversation, at length said, "Canst thou, my uncle, afford me
any information respecting a bird, whose chain is composed of
pearls and emeralds, or of its mistress?"</p>

<p id="id04283">The old man remained silent, involved in thought, for some
instants; after which, he said, "My son, many sultans and princes
have wished to attain this bird and the princess, but failed in
the attempt; however, do thou procure seven lambs, kill them,
flay and cut them up into halves. In the palace are eight courts,
at the gates of seven of which are placed two hungry lions; and
in the latter, where the princess resides, are stationed forty
slaves. Go, and try thy fortune."</p>

<p id="id04284">The prince having thanked the old man, took his leave, procured
the lambs, cut them up as directed, and towards midnight, when
the step of man had ceased from passing, repaired to the first
gate of the palace, before which he beheld two monstrous lions,
their eyes flaming like the mouth of a lighted oven. He cast
before each half a lamb, and while they were devouring it passed
on. By the same stratagem he arrived safely into the eighth
court: at the gate of which lay the forty slaves sunk in profound
sleep. He entered cautiously, and beheld the princess in a
magnificent hall, reposing on a splendid bed; near which hung her
bird in a cage of gold wire strung with valuable jewels. He
approached gently, and wrote upon the palm of her hand, "I am
Alla ad Deen, son of a sultan of Yemen. I have seen thee
sleeping, and taken away thy bird. Shouldst thou love me, or wish
to recover thy favourite, come to my father's capital." He then
departed from the palace, and having reached the plain, stopped
to repose till morning.</p>

<p id="id04285">The prince being refreshed, at day-light having invoked Allah to
protect him from discovery, travelled till sunset, when he
discovered an Arab encampment, to which he repaired and requested
shelter. His petition was readily attended to by the chief; who
seeing him in possession of the bird, which he knew, said to
himself, "This young man must be a favourite of heaven, or he
could not have obtained a prize for which so many potent sultans,
princes, and viziers, have vainly fallen sacrifices." He
entertained him with hospitality, but asked no questions, and in
the morning dismissed him with prayers for his welfare, and a
present of a beautiful horse. Alla ad Deen having thanked his
generous host took leave, and proceeded unceasingly till he
arrived within sight of his father's capital. On the plain he was
again overtaken by his two brothers, returning from their
unsuccessful expedition, who seeing the bird and splendid cage in
his possession, dragged him suddenly from his horse, beat him
cruelly, and left him. They entered the city, and presenting the
cage to their father, framed an artful tale of danger and escapes
that they had undergone in procuring it; on hearing which, the
sultan loaded them with caresses and praises, while the
unfortunate Alla ad Deen retired bruised and melancholy to his
unhappy mother.</p>

<p id="id04286">The young prince informed his mother of his adventures,
complained heavily of his loss, and expressed his resolves to be
revenged upon his envious brothers. She comforted him, entreated
him to be patient, and wait for the dispensations of Allah; who,
in proper season, would shew his power in the revealment of
justice. We now return to the princess who had lost her bird.</p>

<p id="id04287">When she awoke in the morning, and missed her bird, she was
alarmed; but on perceiving what was written upon her palm still
more so. She shrieked aloud; her attendants ran in, and finding
her in a frantic state, informed the sultan; who, anxious for her
safety, hastened to the apartment. The princess being somewhat
recovered, related the loss of her bird, shewed the writing on
her hand, and declared that she would marry no one but him who
had seen her asleep. The sultan finding remonstrances vain,
agreed to accompany his daughter in search of the prince, and
issued orders for his army to prepare for a march to Yemen.</p>

<p id="id04288">When the troops were assembled, the sultan conducted his daughter
to the camp, and on the day following marched; the princess with
her ladies being conveyed in magnificent equipages. No halt was
made till the army arrived near the city, where Alia ad Deen had
delivered the daughter of its sultan by killing the elephant. A
friendly ambassador being dispatched to request permission to
encamp and purchase a supply of provisions, he was honourably
received, and the sultan of the city proceeded in great pomp to
visit his brother monarch, who then informed him of the object of
his expedition. This convinced the other sultan that the stealer
of the bird must also have been the deliverer of his daughter,
and he resolved to join in the search. Accordingly, after three
days of splendid entertainments and rejoicings, the two sultans,
with the two princesses, and their united forces, moved towards
Yemen. Their route lay through the capital, the daughter of whose
sultan Alla ad Deen had saved from the fangs of the savage
monster.</p>

<p id="id04289">On the arrival of the allies at this city an explanation similar
to the last took place, and the third sultan resolved to
accompany them in search of the husband of his daughter, who
readily agreed to join the other princesses. They marched; and on
the route the princess who had lost her bird was fully informed
by the others of the beauty, prowess, and manly vigour of Alla ad
Deen; which involved her more than ever in anxious impatience to
meet him. At length, by continued and uninterrupted movements,
the three sultans reached Yemen, and pitched their encampments
about sunset on a verdant plain well watered, near the capital.</p>

<p id="id04290">It was with much dread and apprehension that the sultan of Yemen
beheld such a numerous host encamped so near his residence; but
he concealed his fears, and gave proper orders for securing it
from surprise during the night. With the morning his alarms were
removed, as the allied sultans dispatched an ambassador with rich
presents, assurances that they had no hostile intentions, and a
request that he would honour them by a visit to their camp, and
furnish it with supplies. The sultan complied with the
invitation, and the suite being prepared, he proceeded, attended
by all his courtiers in the highest magnificence, to the
encampment; where he was received with due honours. At the
outposts the three sultans met him, and after the usual greetings
of ceremony conducted him to a splendid tent made of crimson
velvet, the fringes and ropes of which were composed of gold
threads, the pins of solid silver, and the lining of the richest
silver tissue, embroidered with flowers of raised work in silks
of all colours, intermixed with foils and gold. It was covered
with superb carpets, and at the upper end on a platform spread
with gold brocade were placed four stools, the coverings of
which, and the cushions, were magnificent beyond description,
being made of Persian velvet, fringed and flowered with costly
pearls.</p>

<p id="id04291">When the four sultans were seated, and some conversation had
taken place, in which the latter was informed of the occasion of
the others having marched into his country, the cloth was spread,
and a magnificent entertainment served up in dishes of agate,
crystal, and gold. The basins and ewers for washing were of pure
gold set with jewels. Such was the richness of every thing, that
the sultan with difficulty refrained from shewing his surprise,
and inwardly exclaimed, "By Allah, till now I never have beheld
such a profusion of splendour, elegance, and valuable furniture!"
When the meal was ended, coffee, various sorts of confections,
and sherbets were brought in; after which the company conversed.
The three sultans inquired of their royal guest if he had any
children, to which he replied that he had two sons.</p>

<p id="id04292">The sultans then requested that he would send for them: upon
which, their father dispatched a messenger to summon them to his
presence. They repaired to the camp, mounted on chargers richly
caparisoned, and most splendidly dressed. On their entering the
tent, the princesses, who were seated in a recess concealed from
view by blinds of gold wire, gazed eagerly at them; and she who
had lost her bird inquired of the other two if either of them was
their husband. They replied in the negative, remarking that he
was of personal beauty, and dignified appearance, far superior to
these princes. The three sultans, also, questioned their
daughters on the subject, and received similar answers.</p>

<p id="id04293">The sultans, upon this, inquired of the father of the princes if
he had any other sons; to which he replied that he had one; but
that he had long rejected him, and also his mother, from notice;
and that they lived among the domestics of the palace. The
sultans entreated to see him, and he was introduced, but in a
mean habit. The two princesses whom he had delivered from the
monsters and married immediately recognized him, and exclaimed
together, "This is truly our beloved husband!" He was then
embraced by the sultans, and admitted to his wives; who fell upon
his neck in transports of joy and rapture, kissing him between
his eyes, while the princess who had lost the bird prostrated
herself before him, covered with a veil, and kissed his hand.</p>

<p id="id04294">After this scene the young prince returned to his father, and the
other sultans, who received him respectfully, and seated him by
them, at which the father was astonished; but more so, when,
turning to his brothers, he addressed them, saying, "Which of you
first found the string of emeralds and pearls?" To this they made
no reply: when he continued, "Who of you killed the monster,
destroyed the elephant, or, fortifying his mind, dared to enter
the palace of this sultan, and bring away the cage with the bird?
When you both, coward-like, rushed upon me, robbed me of my
prizes, and wounded me, I could easily have overcome you; but I
felt that there was a season appointed by Providence for justice
upon you and my wretched father, who rejected my mother and
myself, depriving us of our just claims." Having thus spoken, he
drew his sabre, and rushing upon the two guilty princes struck
them dead, each at one blow. He would, in his rage, have attacked
his father; but the sultans prevented him, and having reconciled
them, the old sultan promised to leave him his heir, and to
restore his mother to her former rank and consequence. His
nuptials with the third princess were then celebrated; and their
fathers, after participating for forty days in the magnificent
entertainments given on the occasion, took leave, and returned to
their several kingdoms. The old sultan finding himself, from age,
incapable of the cares of government, resigned the throne to his
son, whose authority was gladly submitted to by the people, who
admired his prowess and gallantry.</p>

<p id="id04295">Some time after his accession to the kingdom, attended only by
some select courtiers, and without the cumbrous appendages of
royalty, he left his capital upon a hunting excursion. In the
course of the sport, passing over a desert plain, he came to a
spot where was the opening of a cave, into which he entered, and
observed domestic utensils and other marks of its being
inhabited; but no one was then within it.</p>

<p id="id04296">The curiosity of the sultan being excited, he resolved to wait
until the owners of the cave should appear, and cautioned his
attendants not to mention his rank. He had not sat long, when a
man was seen advancing with a load of provisions and two skins of
water. On his coming to the mouth of the cave, the sultan
addressed him, saying, "Whence comest thou, where art thou going,
and what dost thou carry?" "I am," replied the man, "one of three
companions, who inhabit this cave, having fled from our city to
avoid imprisonment, and every ten days one of us goes to purchase
provisions: to-day was my turn, and my friends will be here
presently." "What was the cause of your flight?" rejoined the
sultan. "As to that," answered the man, "it can only be
communicated by the relation of our adventures, which are
curious, and if you wish to hear them, stay with us to-night, and
we will each, in our turn, relate his own story."</p>

<p id="id04297">The sultan upon this, said to himself, "I will not move from this
spot until I have heard their adventures;" and immediately
dispatched his attendants, excepting a few, with orders to bring
from the city some necessaries for the night. "For," thought he,
"hearing these stories will be pleasanter than hunting, as they
may, perhaps, inform my mind." He remained in the cave with his
few followers; and soon after arrived the two other inmates, who
were succeeded by the sultan's messengers with the requisites for
a substantial repast, of which all partook without ceremony. When
it was finished, the sultan desired the owners of the cave to
relate their adventures; and they replied, "To hear is to obey:"
the first beginning as follows.</p>

<p id="id04298" style="margin-top: 4em">             Story of the First Sharper in the Cave.</p>

<p id="id04299" style="margin-top: 3em">My father died when I was a youth, leaving my mother and myself
with little property, but an old she-goat, which we sold, and
with the price bought a calf, and nourished her as well as we
could for a whole year; when my mother desired me to go and
dispose of her in the market. Accordingly I went, and soon
perceived that there was not a fatter or finer beast in the
market. The company of butchers, composed of forty persons, fixed
their eyes upon the calf, and supposing me an ignorant lad,
resolved to have her for little or nothing, and feast themselves
upon her flesh. After concerting among themselves, one of them
coming up, said, "My lad, dost thou mean to sell this she-goat?"
"Goat!" replied I, "it is a calf." "Nay," answered he, "surely
thou must be blind or under enchantment; but, old as the goat is,
if thou wilt sell it, I will give thee a koorsh for her." I
angrily refused, and he went away; when presently up came
another; and, in short, in regular succession the whole forty,
the last of whom was the chief of the butchers. I perceived the
connivance to cheat me, and resolving to be revenged, said, "I am
convinced I am deceived, so you shall have the goat, if such she
is, for the koorsh, provided you let me have her tail." This was
agreed to, and it being cut off, I delivered my calf to the chief
of the butchers, received the money, and returned home.</p>

<p id="id04300">On my arrival at home, my mother asked if I had sold the calf; to
which I replied, "Yes, for a koorsh, and her tail into the
bargain." She thought me stupid or mad, and inquired what I would
do with the latter. I answered, "I will be amply revenged on the
sharpers, who pretended that my calf was a she-goat, and force
from them, at least, a thousand times the price they gave me."
After this, I skinned the tail, cut the leather into thongs, and
twisted them into a whip with hard thick knots. I then disguised
myself in female attire, taking pains to make myself look as
handsome as possible with the assistance of my mother, who put
soorma into my eyelids, and arranged my eyebrows, stained my
hands with hinna, and directed me how to ogle and smile. In
short, as I was then a beardless lad, and reckoned comely, I
appeared as a very desirable maiden in my disguise.</p>

<p id="id04301">On my arrival at the house of the chief of the butchers, I found
him sitting with his companions in the court. The whole of my
calf had been cooked in various ways, and they were just going to
spread the cloth and feast upon it. On my entrance I made a
profound salutation: upon which they all rose up to return it,
and having treated me welcomely, whispered one to another,
saying, "By Allah, this will be a night of glorious festivity,
illumined by so much beauty! however, our chief must have the
preference, this night shall be his; after which we will all cast
lots for his turn of enjoyment."</p>

<p id="id04302">When we had feasted on my calf, and the night was far advanced,
the butchers took leave, departed to their homes, and I remained
alone with the chief, who began to entertain me with amusing
conversation. Observing a rope hanging from the ceiling of an
apartment, I, as if ignorant of its purpose, inquired the use of
it; when the venerable chief of the butchers informed me it was
for suspending animals to cut up; also, occasionally his
dependants, whose crimes required the punishment of flogging.
Upon this I expressed a great desire to be tied with the rope,
drawn up, and swung for amusement. "My dear lady," replied he,
"the cord will hurt thy delicate skin; but thou shall put it
round me, draw me up, and see the use without injuring thyself."</p>

<p id="id04303">I consented to the wish of the chief butcher, placed the cord
under his arms, and drew him up till the ends of his toes
scarcely touched the ground. I then secured the rope, and for
some moments kept running playfully round him, and tickling his
sides, which made him laugh with delight. At length, tired of his
posture, he desired me to release him; but I refused, saying, "My
dear chief, I have not yet finished my amusement;" after which I
tore the clothes from his back, as if in merriment. When I had
done this, I pulled out my whip, which was well knotted, saying,
"This is the tail of a she-goat, and not of a calf." The butcher
now began to be somewhat alarmed, asking me who I was, and whence
I came? to which I replied, "I am the owner of the fat calf, of
which thou and thy villanous companions so rascally cheated me."
I then bared my arm to my elbow, and so belaboured his back and
sides with my whip that he roared in agony; nor did I leave off
till his skin was completely flayed, and he fainted from the
pain. After this I searched the apartment, found a bag containing
three hundred deenars, some handsome dresses, and other valuable
articles, all of which I bundled up, and carried off; leaving the
chief of the butchers, suspended, to his fate. When I had reached
home, I gave my prize to my mother, saying, "This is only part of
the value of my calf, which I have just received of the
purchaser."</p>

<p id="id04304">Early in the morning the butchers repaired, as usual, to the
residence of their chief, and finding the door of the court-yard
locked, joked one with another, saying, "Our old gentleman has
been so fatigued with his happiness that he sleeps longer than
ordinary." They waited till near noon, when they called out for
admittance; but receiving no answer, became apprehensive of some
disaster, and forcing the door, found their chief suspended,
almost lifeless, and his scars dropping blood. To their inquiries
into the cause of his doleful situation, he replied, "That
pretended vixen was no woman, but a brawny youth, the owner of
the calf; who, in return for our roguery, has flogged me thus,
and carried off all he could find in my chamber worth having."
The butchers vowed revenge, saying, "We will seize and put him to
death;" but their chief requested them for the present to be
patient, and carry him to a warm bath, that he might wash and get
his wounds dressed.</p>

<p id="id04305">I observed the chief butcher enter the bathing house alone, while
his followers waited at the gate: upon which I went to a
slaughter-house, poured over my back the blood of a sheep, dabbed
it with plaisters of cotton, and leaning on a crutch, as if in
agony of pain, repaired to the bath. At first the butchers
refused me admittance, saying their chief was within; but on my
entreating their compassion for my miserable condition, they at
length permitted me to enter. Passing through the different
rooms, I came to the bath, in which I found the unfortunate chief
washing his scars. I pulled out my whip, and having said to him,
"Shekh, this is the tail of my calf!" flogged him again so
severely that he fainted; after which I made my escape by another
entrance to the hummaum, which opened into a different street.</p>

<p id="id04306">The butchers growing impatient at the long stay of their chief in
the bath, at length entered, and found him in extreme agony. He
informed them of this second revenge of the owner of the calf,
and requested that he would take him into the country, pitch a
tent for his reception, and remain to guard him till he should be
cured of his wounds. They did so; but I watched their motions,
and disguising myself, repaired in the evening towards the tent.
Here I found a Bedouin Arab, whom I bribed with a piece of gold
to cry out, "I am the owner of the calf, and will have the life
of your chief!" cautioning him at the same time, after he had so
exclaimed, to make his escape as quickly as possible from the
butchers, who would pursue him. "I shall not heed them," replied
he, "though they may be mounted on the fleetest coursers."</p>

<p id="id04307">Having said this, the Bedouin went up close to the tents, bawling
out vociferously, as I had directed him: upon which all the
butchers started up and pursued him, but in vain, to a great
distance. I then entered the tent in which the chief was reposing
alone, and pulling out my whip, once more flogged him till he
roared with agony. When I was tired I bundled up such articles as
I could lay my hands on; and returning home, presented them to my
mother, saying, "Here is the balance of the price of our calf."</p>

<p id="id04308">The butchers having attempted to overtake the Bedouin, till they
were wearied with running, but in vain, returned to their chief,
whom they found in a fainting fit from the pain of his wounds.
Having sprinkled water on his face, they recovered him so far
that he was able to inform them of what had happened; and to
request them to convey him once more to his own house, to give
out that he was dead of his wounds, and make a mock funeral;
when, possibly, the owner of the calf, believing him departed
this life, might cease to torment him.</p>

<p id="id04309">The butchers obeyed the commands of their chief, and reporting
that he was dead, laid him in a litter, and marched in mournful
procession towards the burying ground, followed by a great
concourse of people. Mixing with the crowd, in disguise, I at
length stooped under the litter, and giving the chief, who lay
extended in a winding sheet, a smart poke with a pointed stick,
up he jumped, to the astonishment of the beholders; who cried
out, "A miracle! a miracle! the dead is raised to life!" while I
made my escape in the throng; but being fearful that the many
tricks I had played, especially this last, might excite inquiry,
and lead to a discovery, I fled from the city, and resolved to
remain in this cave till curiosity should subside.</p>

<p id="id04310">The sultan exclaimed, "These adventures are surprising;" when the
second inhabitant of the cave said, "My lord, my story is much
more wonderful than the last; for I contrived not only to be dead
and buried, but to escape from the tomb." "Possibly," said the
sultan, "thy adventures may have been stranger than those of this
man; but if any of you are acquainted with the memoirs of ancient
monarchs, I could wish you to relate them; however, at present, I
must take you with me to the palace, that I may make you
welcome." When the men heard this proposition, they were alarmed,
and cried out, "What, my lord, would you carry us to the city
from which we have escaped to save our lives?" "Fear not,"
replied he, "I am the sultan, and was amusing myself with hunting
when I chanced to discover your cave." They bowed themselves
before him, and exclaimed, "To hear is to obey;" after which they
attended him to the city. On their arrival, the sultan ordered
them proper apartments and suitable entertainment, and invested
each of them with a rich habit. For some days they remained
enjoying themselves; when, at length, one evening the sultan
commanded them to his presence, and requested a narrative, when
one of them related the following story.</p>

<p id="id04311" style="margin-top: 4em">                 History of the Sultan of Hind.</p>

<p id="id04312" style="margin-top: 3em">In ancient days there lived a sultan of Hind, than whom no prince
of the age was greater in extent of territory, riches, or force;
but Heaven had not allotted to him offspring, either male or
female: on which account he was involved in sorrow. One morning,
being even more melancholy than usual, he put on a red habit, and
repaired to his divan; when his vizier, alarmed at the robes of
mourning, said, "What can have occasioned my lord to put on this
gloomy habit?" "Alas!" replied the sultan, "my soul is this
morning overclouded with melancholy." "Repair then to the
treasury," said the vizier, "and view thy wealth; as, perhaps,
the lustre of gold, and the brilliant sparkling of jewels, may
amuse thy senses and disperse thy sorrow." "Vizier," answered the
sultan, "this world to me is all vanity; I regard nothing but the
contemplation of the Deity: yet how can I be relieved from
melancholy, since I have lived to this age and he has not blessed
me with children, either sons or daughters, who are the ornaments
of manhood in this world?"</p>

<p id="id04313">The sultan had scarcely ceased speaking, when a human figure of a
dusky hue appeared before him, and said, "My sovereign, here is a
confection left me by my ancestors, with an assurance, that
whoever might eat of it would have offspring." The sultan eagerly
took the confection, and by the blessing of Allah, one of the
ladies of his haram conceived that very night. When her pregnancy
was made known to him, the sultan was overjoyed, distributed
large sums in charity to the poor, and every day comforted the
distressed by his bounty.</p>

<p id="id04314">When the sultana had gone her full time, she was delivered of a
son beautiful in aspect, and of graceful person; at which the
sultan became overjoyed, and on that day set apart one half of
his treasures for the use of the infant prince, who was intrusted
to the charge of experienced nurses. After he had thrived
sufficiently at the breast he was weaned, and at six years of age
put under the care of learned tutors, who taught him to write, to
read the Koran, and instructed him in the other several branches
of literature. When he had completed his twelfth year, he was
accomplished in horsemanship, archery, and throwing the lance,
till at length he became a distinguished cavalier, and excelled
the most celebrated equestrians.</p>

<p id="id04315">The young prince being on a certain day hunting in the vicinity
of the capital, there suddenly appeared soaring and wheeling in
the air a bird, whose plumage was of the most beautiful and
glossy green. The prince let fly an arrow, but without effect,
and the bird suddenly disappeared. It was in vain that he turned
his eye to all quarters, in hopes of again discovering his
wished-for prey, for the bird had flown out of sight, and the
prince after searching in all directions till the close of day,
returned vexed and much disappointed to his father's palace. On
his entrance, the sultan and sultana perceiving his countenance
gloomy, inquired the cause of his melancholy, when he informed
them of the bird: upon which, they said, "Dear son, the creatures
of the Almighty are innumerably diversified; and, doubtless,
there are many birds as beautiful, and wonderfully more so than
this, whose escape you so much regret." "It may be so," replied
the prince; "but unless I shall be able to take this, which has
so captivated my fancy, I will abstain from food."</p>

<p id="id04316">On the following morning the prince repaired again to the chase,
and having reached the same spot on the plain, to his great joy
beheld the green bird. Having taken a cautious aim, he let fly an
arrow; but she evaded it, and soared before him in the air. The
prince spurred his courser and followed, keeping his desired prey
in sight unceasingly till sunset; when both himself and his horse
being exhausted he gave up the pursuit, and returned towards the
city. As he was riding slowly, and almost fainting with hunger
and fatigue, there met him a venerable looking personage, who
said, "Prince, both thyself and thy charger seem exhausted; what
can have been the cause of such over exercise?" "Father,"
answered the prince, "I have been pursuing, but in vain, a
beautiful green bird, on which I had set my mind." "Son," replied
the sage, "if thou wert to follow it for a whole year's journey,
thy pursuit would be useless; for thou couldst never take it.
This bird comes from a city in the country of Kafoor, in which
are most delightful gardens abounding in such birds as this, and
many other species still more beautiful, some of which sing
enchantingly, and others talk like human beings; but, alas thou
canst never reach that happy spot. Give up then all thoughts of
the bird, and seek some other object for a favourite that thou
mayst enjoy repose, and no longer vex thyself for
impossibilities." When the prince heard this from the old man, he
exclaimed, "By Allah! nothing shall prevent me from visiting the
charming country thou hast mentioned;" and leaving the sage, he
rode homewards, his mind wholly taken up in meditating on the
land of Kafoor.</p>

<p id="id04317">When the prince had reached the palace, the sultan perceiving his
disordered state, inquired the adventures of the day; and being
informed of his fruitless pursuit, and the remarks of the old
man, said, "My son, discharge this idle chimera from thy mind,
nor perplex thyself longer, since he who wishes for an
impossibility may pine himself to death, but can never gain his
desires: calm then thy soul, nor vex thyself longer in vain." "By
Allah!" answered the prince, "my soul, O my father, is captivated
with the desire of possessing this bird more strongly than ever,
from the words of the venerable old man; nor is it possible I can
enjoy repose till I have travelled to the island of Kafoor, and
beheld the gardens containing such a wonderful feathered
species." "Alas! my dear son," exclaimed the sultan, "think how
afflicting must be to myself and thy mother thy absence from our
sight, and for our sakes give up such a fruitless expedition."</p>

<p id="id04318">The prince, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his father,
continued obstinate, and said, "My travelling is inevitable:
grant me then permission, or I will put myself to death." "If
so," exclaimed the affrighted sultan, "there is no refuge or help
but from the omnipotent Allah: well has the proverb remarked,
that the nestling would not be restrained from the air, when
suddenly the raven pounced upon it and bore it away. Heaven guard
my son from the consequences of his imprudence." Having said
thus, the sultan commanded preparations for the requisites of
travel, and ordered a force to accompany the headstrong prince;
who, having taken leave of his afflicted parents, began his
expedition towards the country of Kafoor.</p>

<p id="id04319">The prince pursued his journey without any extraordinary
adventure for a whole month, and at the expiration of it arrived
at a spot from which branched out three roads. At the junction of
them was erected a lofty pyramid, each face fronting one of the
roads. On one face was inscribed, "This is named the Path of
Safety:" on the second, "This is called the Way of Repentance:"
and on the third, "Whoever follows this road will not probably
return." "I will pursue this last," said the prince to himself,
and accordingly striking into it, proceeded onwards for twenty
days, at the end of which he encamped near a desolated city,
crumbling into ruin, wholly destitute of inhabitants. He
commanded his attendants, as no provisions could be found in the
city, to kill five sheep of the flocks he had brought with him,
and dress them for their refreshment in various ways. When all
were ready, and the simmaut was spread out, having performed his
ablutions, he sat down with his principal followers.</p>

<p id="id04320">The prince and his company had scarcely seated themselves, when,
lo! there advanced from the desolated city a Genie, whom the
prince seeing, stood up, and thus accosted, "Hail! and welcome to
the sovereign of the Aoon, friendly to his brethren, and ruler of
this extensive desert." He then addressed him, flatteringly, in
fluent language and eloquent expression. The hair of this Oone
Genie hung shaggily over his eyes, and flowed in matted tresses
upon his shoulders. The prince took out a pair of scissors, and
having condescendingly cut his hair, pared his nails, and washed
him, seated him at the cloth, and placed before him the dish
dressed peculiarly for himself.</p>

<p id="id04321">The Oone ate, and was delighted with the affability of the
prince, whom he addressed, saying, "By Allah, O Mahummud, son of
a sultan! I am doomed to death by thy arrival here; but what, my
lord, was thy object in coming?" Upon this the prince informed
him of his having seen the bird, his vain attempts to take her,
the account he had received from the old man, and his resolution,
in consequence of his information, to penetrate to the kingdom of
Kafoor, to visit the gardens, and bring away some of the
wonderful birds.</p>

<p id="id04322">When the Oone heard this, he said, "O son of a sultan, that
country to thee is impenetrable, thou canst not reach it; for the
distance from hence is a journey of three hundred years to the
most laborious traveller; how then canst thou hope to arrive at
it, much more return? But, my son, the good old proverb remarks,
that kindness should be returned with kindness, and evil with
evil, and that none are so cruel or so benevolent as the
inhabitants of the desert. As thou hast treated me kindly, so,
God willing, shalt thou have a return for thy goodness; but thou
must leave here thy attendants and thy effects. Thou and I only
will go together, and I will accomplish thy wish in gratitude for
what thou hast done for me." The prince immediately retired from
his encampment with the Oone, who said, "Mount upon my
shoulders."</p>

<p id="id04323">The prince obeyed the commands of the Oone, who having first
stopped his rider's ears with cotton, mounted into the air, and
after soaring for some hours descended; when the prince found
himself in the island of Kafoor, and near the desired garden.
Having alighted from the shoulders of the generous Oone, he
examined the spot, beheld groves, blooming shrubs, flowers
bordering clear streams, and beautiful birds chanting various
melodies. The Oone said, "Behold the object, of thy search, enter
the garden!" Upon this the prince left him, passed the gate,
which was open, and entered. He walked on every quarter, and
depending from the branches of flowering shrubs saw cages holding
a variety of beautiful birds, two birds in each cage.</p>

<p id="id04324">The prince took down a large cage, and having examined the birds,
placed in it such as pleased him to the number of six, with which
he was preparing to leave the garden; when at the gate a watchman
met him, who cried out loudly, "A robber! a robber!" Instantly
numerous guards rushing out, seized the prince, bound, and
carried him before the sultan, to whom they complained, saying,
"We found in the garden this young man, carrying off a cage with
six birds. He must certainly be a robber."</p>

<p id="id04325">The sultan addressed the prince, saying, "What induced thee,
youthful stranger, to violate my property, trespass on the
garden, and attempt stealing these birds?" The prince returned no
answer: upon which the sultan exclaimed, "Young man, thou art
verging upon death; yet still, if thy soul is bent upon having
these birds, bring me from the Black Island some bunches of
grapes, which are composed of emeralds and diamonds, and I will
give thee six birds in addition to those thou hast stolen."
Having said this, the sultan released the prince, who repaired to
his generous friend the Oone, whom he informed of the unlucky
conclusion of his adventure. "Our task is an easy one," answered
the Oone; "mount upon my shoulders."</p>

<p id="id04326">The prince did as he was desired, and after two hours flight the
Oone descended and alighted, when the prince found himself in the
Black Island. He immediately advanced towards the garden in which
was the fruit composed of emeralds and diamonds. On the way a
monster met him of terrible appearance.</p>

<p id="id04327">The monster sprung at the prince, who, with surprising agility,
drawing his sword, wounded the furious beast on the forehead with
such effect, that, uttering a dreadful groan, he fell dead at his
feet. It happened, by divine decree, that the sultan's daughter
looking from a window of the haram, beheld the combat, and,
stricken with the manly beauty and prowess of the prince,
exclaimed, "Who can withstand thy courage, or who resist thy all
conquering charms?" But he did not see the princess, or hear her
applause.</p>

<p id="id04328">The prince, after having slain the monster, proceeded to the
garden, the gate of which he found open, and on entering,
perceived variety of artificial trees composed of precious
stones. Among them was one resembling the vine, the fruits of
which were of emeralds and diamonds. He plucked off six bunches,
and was quitting the garden when a sentinel met him; who, being
alarmed, cried out, "A robber! a robber!" The guards rushed out,
and having bound him, carried him before the sultan, saying, "My
lord, we found this youth stealing the fruit from the garden of
jewels."</p>

<p id="id04329">The sultan was enraged, and on the point of ordering him to be
put to death, when a number of persons entered, crying out, "Good
tidings to our sovereign." "On what account?" exclaimed the
sultan. "The horrible monster," replied they, "who used annually
to appear and devour our sons and daughters, we have just now
found dead and cloven in two." The sultan was so rejoiced at this
happy event, that he refrained from the blood of the prince, and
exclaimed, "Whoever has destroyed this monster let him come to
me, and I swear by Allah, who has invested me with royalty, that
I will give him my daughter in marriage; and whatever else he may
desire, even to the half of my empire."</p>

<p id="id04330">Upon the sultan's declaration being proclaimed, several young men
appeared, pretending that they had killed the monster, and gave
various accounts of the combat, which made the prince smile. "By
Allah! it is strange," said the sultan, "that a youth in such a
perilous situation should be so unconcerned as to smile." While
the sultan was ruminating on this occurrence, a eunuch entered
from the haram, requesting that he would come and speak to the
princess his daughter, who had business of importance to
communicate; upon which the sultan arose, and retired from the
hall of audience.</p>

<p id="id04331">When the sultan had entered the princess's apartment, he said,
"What can have happened which has occasioned you to send for me
so suddenly?" She replied, "Is it thy wish to know who slew the
monster, and to reward the courageous hero?" "By Allah," answered
the sultan, "who created subjects and their sovereigns, if I can
discover him, my first offer to him shall be to espouse thee,
whatever be his condition, or though he dwell in the most distant
region." The princess rejoined, "No one slew the monster but the
youth who entered the garden of gems, and was bearing off the
fruit, whom thou wast just now on the point of putting to death."</p>

<p id="id04332">When the sultan heard the above from his daughter, he returned to
the divan, and calling the prince before him, said, "Young man, I
grant thee thy pardon; art thou he who destroyed the monster?" "I
am," replied the prince. The sultan would instantly have summoned
the cauzee to perform the espousals; but the prince said, "I have
a friend to consult; permit me to retire, and I will soon
return." The sultan consented, saying, "Thy request is but
reasonable; but come back quickly." The prince having repaired to
his friend the Oone, informed him of what had happened to him,
and of the offer of the sultan's daughter in marriage: upon which
the Oone said, "Accept the princess; but on condition that, if
you marry her, you shall be allowed to carry her to your own
kingdom." The prince having returned to the sultan, proposed his
terms, which were readily agreed to, and the nuptials were
celebrated with the most splendid magnificence. After abiding in
the palace of the sultan for a month and three days, he requested
permission to depart with his bride towards his own country,
which was granted.</p>

<p id="id04333">On the departure of the prince, his father-in-law presented him
with a hundred bunches of the grapes composed of emeralds and
diamonds, and he repaired to his friend the Oone; who, having
first stopped their ears with cotton, mounted them upon his
shoulders, and soaring into the air, after two hours descended
near the capital of the island of Kafoor. The prince, taking four
bunches of the jewelled fruit, hastened to the palace, and laid
them before the sultan; who, in astonishment, exclaimed, "Surely,
this young stranger must be a powerful magician, or how could he
have travelled the distance of three hundred years' journey, and
have accomplished his purpose in less time than three months!
Such an action is truly miraculous. Hast thou, indeed, young
man," said the sultan, "been at the Black Island?" "I have,"
answered the prince. "Describe it to me," replied the sultan,
"its appearance, its buildings, its gardens, and rivers." The
prince having answered all his queries, the sultan said, "Noble
youth, you may assuredly ask of me whatever you wish!" "I want
nothing but the birds," rejoined the prince. "They are thine,"
returned the sultan; "but annually on a certain day, and this is
it, there descends from yonder mountain a monstrous vulture,
which tears in pieces our men, women, and children; and having
flown away with them in his gigantic talons devours their flesh.
I have a beautiful daughter, whom, if thou canst overcome this
calamitous monster, I will give to thee in marriage."</p>

<p id="id04334">The prince replied, "I will consult my friend;" and then returned
to the Oone, whom he informed of the offer; but he had scarcely
done speaking, when, lo! the vulture appeared: upon which the
Oone, ascending into the air, attacked the monster, and after a
fierce combat, tore him into halves; after which he descended to
the prince, and said, "Go to the sultan, and acquaint him that
his destructive enemy is slain."</p>

<p id="id04335">The prince did as he was directed: upon which the sultan with his
train, and an immense crowd of the inhabitants of the city, came
out on horseback, and beheld the monstrous vulture, stretched
dead on the ground, torn in halves. The sultan then conducted the
prince of Hind to the palace; where his marriage with the
princess was instantly celebrated, amid the highest festivity and
rejoicings; and after remaining a full month at the sultan's
court, he requested leave to depart; when his father-in-law
presented him with ten cages, in each of which were four of the
beautiful birds of variously coloured plumage, and dismissed him,
after an affectionate farewell, with his daughter.</p>

<p id="id04336">The prince having departed from the sultan repaired to his
faithful friend the Oone, who welcomed his return; and having
mounted him upon his back with his two brides, his jewel fruit,
and the cages, immediately ascended into the air, from whence,
after soaring for some hours, he gradually descended, and
alighted near the ruined city, where the prince had left his
tents, cattle, and followers, whom he found anxiously expecting
his arrival. The friendly Oone had scarcely set him down, when he
said to the prince, "My young friend Mahummud, the obligation
already conferred upon me by thy coming here was great; but I
have one more favour to request." "What can that be?" replied the
prince. "That thou leave not this spot," continued the Oone,
"until thou hast washed my corpse, enshrouded, and laid it in the
grave." Having said thus, the Oone suddenly uttered one loud
groan, and instantly his soul took its flight from the body. The
astonished prince stood for some time overpowered with sorrow;
but at length recovering himself, he, with the assistance of his
domestics, washed the corpse, wrapped it in a winding sheet, and
having prayed over it, deposited it in the earth.</p>

<p id="id04337">The funeral ceremonies of his friend being over, he commenced his
march homewards, and after three days arrived in sight of the
inscribed pyramid, near which he perceived an extensive
encampment, which, on reconnoitring, he found to be that of his
father. The aged sultan, unable to bear the absence of his son,
had marched from his capital in hopes of overtaking him; but on
his arrival at the junction of the three ways, being confounded
at the sight of the inscriptions, he had halted, not knowing
where to proceed. Great was his joy on discovering the prince
advancing towards that face of the pyramid on which was engraved,
"Whoever travels this road will probably never return." When the
raptures of meeting and mutual congratulations were over, the
prince informed the sultan of his wonderful and successful
adventures, which overpowered him with astonishment and joy.
After reposing a few days, they proceeded towards the capital of
the sultan; where tidings having arrived of their approach, the
inhabitants ornamented the city with silks, carpets, and
transparent paintings; and the nobles and respectable persons
issued forth with splendid trains to meet and congratulate their
sovereign and the prince, who entered in triumphal procession,
amid the greatest rejoicings and prayers for their welfare and
prosperity.</p>

<h2 id="id04338" style="margin-top: 4em">                 STORY OF THE FISHERMAN'S SON.</h2>

<p id="id04339" style="margin-top: 3em">A fisherman's son having in company with his father caught a
large fish, the latter proposed to present it to the sultan, in
hopes of receiving a great reward. While he was gone home to
fetch a basket, the son, moved by compassion, returned the fish
into the water; but fearful of his father's anger, fled from his
country, and repaired to a distant city, where he was entertained
by a person as a servant. Strolling one day in the market, he saw
a Jew purchase of a lad a cock at a very high price, and send it
by his slave to his wife, with orders to keep it safely till his
return home. The fisherman's son supposing that as the Jew gave
so great a price for the cock it must possess some extraordinary
property, resolved to obtain it; and, accordingly, having bought
two large fowls, carried them to the Jew's wife, whom he informed
that her husband had sent him for the cock, which he had
exchanged for the fowls. She gave it him; and he having retired,
killed the bird, in whose entrails he found a magical ring; which
being rubbed by his touch, a voice proceeded from it demanding
what were the commands of its possessor, which should be
immediately executed by the genii who were servants of the ring.
The fisherman's son was rejoiced at his good fortune, and while
meditating what use he should make of his ring, passed by the
sultan's palace, at the gates of which were suspended many human
heads. He inquired the reason, and was informed that they were
those of unfortunate princes, who having failed in performing the
conditions on which the sultan's daughter was offered them in
marriage, had been put to death. Hoping to be more fortunate than
them by the aid of his ring, he resolved to demand the princess's
hand. He rubbed the ring, when the voice asked his commands: upon
which he required a rich dress, and it was instantly laid before
him. He put it on, repaired to the palace, and being introduced
to the sultan, demanded his daughter to wife. The sultan
consented, on condition that his life should be forfeited unless
he should remove a lofty and extensive mound of sand that lay on
one side of the palace, which must be done before he could wed
the princess. He accepted the condition; but demanded an interval
of forty days to perform the task. This being agreed to, he took
his leave, and having repaired to his lodging, rubbed his ring,
commanded the genii to remove the mound, and erect on the space
it covered a magnificent palace, and to furnish it suitably for a
royal residence. In fifteen days the task was completed; he was
wedded to the princess, and declared heir to the sultan. In the
mean while, the Jew whom he had tricked of the cock and the
magical ring resolved to travel in search of his lost prize, and
at last arrived at the city, where he was informed of the
wonderful removal of the mound, and the erection of the palace.
He guessed that it must have been done by means of his ring, to
recover which he planned the following stratagem. Having
disguised himself as a merchant, he repaired to the palace, and
cried for sale valuable jewels. The princess hearing him, sent an
attendant to examine them and inquire their price, when the Jew
asked in exchange only old rings. This being told to the
princess, she recollected that her husband kept an old shabby
looking ring in his writing stand, and he being asleep, she took
it out, and sent it to the Jew; who, knowing it to be the one he
had so long sought for, eagerly gave for it all the jewels in his
basket. He retired with his prize, and having rubbed the ring,
commanded the genii to convey the palace and all its inhabitants,
excepting the fisherman's son, into a distant desert island,
which was done instantly. The fisherman's son, on awaking in the
morning, found himself lying on the mound of sand, which had
reoccupied its old spot. He arose, and in alarm lest the sultan
should put him to death in revenge for the loss of his daughter,
fled to another kingdom as quickly as possible. Here he endured a
disconsolate life, subsisting on the sale of some jewels, which
he happened to have upon his dress at his flight. Wandering one
day through a town, a man offered him for sale a dog, a cat, and
a rat, which he purchased, and kept, diverting his melancholy
with their tricks, and uncommon playfulness together. These
seeming animals proved to be magicians; who, in return for his
kindness, agreed to recover for their master his lost prize, and
informed him of their intention. He eagerly thanked them, and
they all set out in search of the palace, the ring, and the
princess. At length they reached the shore of the ocean, after
much travel, and descried the island on which it stood, when the
dog swam over, carrying on his back the cat and the rat. Being
landed, they proceeded to the palace; when the rat entered, and
perceived the Jew asleep upon a sofa, with the ring laid before
him, which he seized in his mouth, and then returned to his
companions. They began to cross the sea, as before, but when
about half over the dog expressed a wish to carry the ring in his
mouth. The rat refused, lest he should drop it; but the dog
threatened, unless he would give it him, to dive and drown them
both in the sea. The rat, alarmed for his life, complied with his
demand: but the dog missed his aim in snatching at the ring,
which fell into the ocean. They landed, and informed the
fisherman's son of his loss: upon which he, in despair, resolved
to drown himself; when suddenly, as he was going to execute his
purpose, a great fish appearing with the ring in his mouth, swam
close to shore, and having dropped it within reach of the
despairing youth, miraculously exclaimed, "I am the fish which
you released from captivity, and thus reward you for your
generosity." The fisherman's son, overjoyed, returned to his
father-in-law's capital, and at night rubbing the ring, commanded
the genii to convey the palace to its old site. This being done
in an instant, he entered the palace, and seized the Jew, whom he
commanded to be cast alive into a burning pile, in which he was
consumed. From this period he lived happily with his princess,
and on the death of the sultan succeeded to his dominions.</p>

<h2 id="id04340" style="margin-top: 4em">             STORY OF ABOU NEEUT AND ABOU NEEUTEEN;
            OR, THE WELL-INTENTIONED AND THE DOUBLE-MINDED.</h2>

<p id="id04341" style="margin-top: 3em">A person named Abou Neeut, or the well-intentioned, being much
distressed in his own country, resolved to seek a better livelihood in
another. Accordingly he took with him all he possessed, being only one
single sherif, and began his journey. He had not travelled far when
there overtook him a man, who entertained him with his conversation;
in the course of which it appeared that his name was Abou Neeuteen, or
double-minded. Being upon the same scheme, they agreed to seek their
fortunes together, and it was settled that Abou Neeut should be the
purse-bearer of the common stock. The other possessed ten sherifs.</p>

<p id="id04342">After some days of toilsome journey they reached a city; on
entering which, a beggar accosted them, crying out, "Worthy
believers, disburse your alms and ye shall be rewarded ten-fold."
Upon this, Abou Neeut gave him a sherif; when his companion,
enraged at what he thought prodigality, demanded back his money,
which was given him, and he marched off leaving his new friend
without any thing. Abou Neeut, resigned to his fate, and relying
on Providence, proceeded to a mosque to pay his devotions, hoping
to meet some charitable person who would relieve his necessities;
but he was mistaken. For a night and day he remained in the
mosque, but no one offered him charity. Pressed by hunger, he in
the dusk of evening stole out, and wandered with fainting steps
through the streets. At length perceiving a servant throwing the
fragments from an eating cloth, he advanced, and gathering them
up, sat down in a corner, and gnawed the bones and half-eaten
morsels with eagerness; after which, lifting up his eyes towards
heaven, he thanked God for his scanty meal. The servant, who had
observed his motions, was surprised and affected at his wretched
condition and devotion, of which he informed his master; who,
being a charitable man, took from his purse ten sherifs, which he
ordered the servant to give to Abou Neeut.</p>

<p id="id04343">The servant, through avarice, having retained one sherif as a
perquisite, delivered the rest to Abou Neeut; who, having counted
the money, thanked God for his bounty; but said, agreeably to the
scriptural declaration he ought to have had ten-fold for the
sherif he had given to the beggar. The master of the servant
overhearing this, called Abou Neeut up stairs; and having seated
him, inquired his story, which he faithfully related to his host,
who was a capital merchant, and was so much pleased at his pious
simplicity, that he resolved to befriend him, and desired him to
abide for the present in his house.</p>

<p id="id04344">Abou Neeut had resided some days with his friendly host, when the
season arrived at which the merchant, who was punctual in
discharging the duties of religion, having examined his stock,
set apart the tenth of it in kind, and bestowed it upon his
guest, whom he advised to open a shop and try his fortune in
trade. Abou Neeut did so, and was so successful, that in a few
years he became one of the most reputable merchants in the place.</p>

<p id="id04345">At the end of this period, sitting one day in his warehouse, he
saw in the streets wretchedly habited, lean, and with eyes sunken
and dim, his old companion Abou Neeuteen, begging alms of
passengers with the importunate cry of distress. Abou Neeut
compassionating his miserable situation, ordered a servant to
call him to him; and on his arrival, having seated him, sent for
refreshments to relieve his immediate want. He then invited him
to spend the night at his house; and in the evening, having shut
up his warehouse, conducted him home, where a bath was made warm
for him, and when he had bathed, he was presented with a change
of handsome apparel. Supper was served, and when they had eaten
till they were satisfied they conversed on several subjects. At
length Abou Neeut exclaimed, "Dost thou not recollect me, my
brother?" "No, by Allah, most liberal host," replied the other;
"but who art thou?" "I was," answered Abou Neeut, "the companion
of thy travel at such a period; but my disposition is still
unchanged, nor have I forgotten our old connection. Half of what
I possess is thine."</p>

<p id="id04346">Having said this, Abou Neeut balanced his accounts, and gave half
of his property to his distressed fellow traveller; who with it
stocked a warehouse, and traded for himself with good success.
For some time the two friends lived near each other in great
repute, when Abou Neeuteen growing restless, requested Abou Neeut
to quit their present abode, and travel for recreation and
profit. "My dear friend," replied Abou Neeut, "why should we
travel? have we not here affluence and ease, and what more can we
enjoy in any part of the world?" This remonstrance had no effect
on Abou Neeuteen, who became so importunate, that at length his
kind friend yielded to his whim; they loaded an ample stock of
merchandize on mules and camels, and departed for the city of
Moussul.</p>

<p id="id04347">After travelling ten days, they one evening encamped near a deep
well, round which they took up their lodging. In the morning Abou
Neeut, by his own desire, was let down into the well, more
readily to fill the water bags for the use of the caravan, men
and cattle, little apprehending what was by Providence decreed to
befall him; for his ungrateful friend, who envied his prosperity,
and coveted his wealth, having loaded the beasts, cut the rope at
the top of the well, and leaving him to his fate, departed.</p>

<p id="id04348">Abou Neeut remained all day without food, but humbly putting his
trust in Allah for deliverance. About the middle of the following
night he overheard two Afreets in conversation with each other,
when one said, "I am now perfectly happy: for at length I have
possessed the beautiful princess of Moussul, and no one can drive
me away, unless by sprinkling the infusion of wormwood under her
feet on a Friday during divine service in the great mosque, a
recipe which will hardly be found out." "I," continued the other
Afreet, "have been as fortunate as yourself: for I am in
possession of such a hidden treasure of gold and jewels, under
the mound near Moussul, as cannot be computed, the talisman of
which cannot be opened to any one unless by killing on the mound
a white cock, and pouring over it the blood; which secret I
judge, will not be found out by man." Having said this, the
Afreets took their flight from the well.</p>

<p id="id04349">Abou Neeut treasured up in his mind the conversation of the
Afreets, and at day-light was happily delivered from the well by
the arrival of a caravan, some of the followers of which were let
down to fill water, and having discovered him, charitably drew
him up, and gave him some refreshments. When he was somewhat
revived by them, they inquired by what accident he had remained
in the well; and he, concealing the treachery of his ungrateful
companion, informed them that having reposed to sleep on the edge
he had fallen in, and not being missed at the time by his fellow
travellers, the caravan had proceeded on its journey. He then
begged leave to accompany his generous deliverers to Moussul, to
which they agreed, and liberally furnished him with a conveyance.</p>

<p id="id04350">On entering the city Abou Neeut perceived all the people in
motion, and on inquiring the reason, was informed that they were
hastening to the great square before the palace, to see the
beheading of a physician, who had failed in attempting to expel
an evil spirit that had long possessed the daughter of the
sultan, and that such had been the fate of many unhappy men who
had tried their skill upon the unfortunate princess. Upon this
intelligence he hastened with all speed to the palace, and having
obtained admission to the sultan, made the usual prostrations;
after which he offered to expel the evil spirit, and begged as
part of his reward the sparing of the life of the unsuccessful
physician. To this the sultan for the present agreed; but
declared, that should Abou Neeut fail in his undertaking, he
would execute them together, as ignorant pretenders in their art.
Abou Neeut then begged that the trial of his skill might be
deferred till the Friday, which he requested of the sultan might
be solemnly observed, as the devout prayers of all true believers
would draw down a blessing on his operations. The sultan
consented; the unfortunate physician was released from the
executioner, and commanded to be kept in the palace, in which
Abou Neeut had also an apartment allotted him. Proclamation was
then made through the city for the strict celebration of the
approaching sabbath, under pain of the royal displeasure on those
who should neglect it.</p>

<p id="id04351">Friday being arrived, and the whole city assembled at prayers,
Abou Neeut prepared his infusion of wormwood, as the Afreet had
mentioned. Being introduced into the apartment of the princess,
who lay in a melancholy stupor, he poured the infusion upon her
feet, when a loud yell was heard near her, and she starting up,
as if from sleep, called upon her attendants to assist her in
rising. News was immediately conveyed to the sultan of the
princess's recovery, and he came overjoyed to witness her
returned senses. He commanded public rejoicings to be made, large
sums to be distributed in alms, and desired Abou Neeut to demand
what he chose in reward for his important service, at the same
time ordering the unsuccessful physician to be set at liberty,
with a handsome present.</p>

<p id="id04352">Abou Neeut, who had been captivated by the beauty of the princess,
asked, as his reward, her hand in marriage: upon which the sultan
consulted with his viziers, who advised him to dismiss the petitioner
for the present, with orders to return in the morning, when he should
receive the sultan's decision on a request which demanded much
consideration. When Abou Neeut had retired, the viziers represented to
the sultan, that it was fitting the husband of his daughter should at
least possess great wealth: for though Abou Neeut had expelled the
evil spirit, yet if he could not support her in a manner becoming her
rank, he was not worthy to marry her. They, therefore, advised him to
select a number of his most valuable jewels, to shew them to Abou
Neeut, and demand as a dowry for the princess some of equal
estimation; which if he could produce he was ready to receive him as
his son-in-law; but if not, he must accept a compensation for his
services more suited to his condition than the royal alliance.</p>

<p id="id04353">On Abou Neeut's appearance at court the next morning the sultan
displayed the jewels, and made the proposal advised by his
viziers; when looking with the utmost indifference upon the
brilliant stones before him, he assured the sultan that he would
the next day present him with ten times the number, of superior
value and lustre; which declaration astonished the whole court,
as it was known that no prince possessed richer gems than those
in possession of the sultan of Moussul.</p>

<p id="id04354">Abou Neeut having taken leave of the sultan proceeded to the
poultry market, and having purchased a cock entirely white and
free from blemish, brought it to his lodgings, where he continued
till the rising of the moon, when he walked out of the city
alone, and speeded to the mound of blueish earth mentioned by the
Afreet of the well to contain the invaluable hidden treasure.
Being arrived at the mound, he ascended it, cut the throat of the
cock, whose blood began to flow, when, lo! the earth shook, and
soon made an opening, through which, to his great satisfaction,
he perceived such heaps of inestimable precious stones, of all
sorts, as are not to be adequately described, Abou Neeut now went
back to the city, where, having procured ten camels, with two
panniers on each, he returned and loaded them with his treasure,
which he conveyed to his lodging, having first filled up the
cavity of the mound.</p>

<p id="id04355">In the morning Abou Neeut repaired with his loaded camels to the
palace, and entering the court of the divan, in which the sultan
sat expecting him, after a profound obeisance, cried out,
"Descend for a moment, my lord, and examine the dowry of the
princess." The sultan, arising from his throne, came down the
steps of the hall, and the camels being made to kneel, he
examined the panniers, and was so astonished at the richness of
their contents, being jewels far surpassing his own in size and
lustre, that he exclaimed, "By Allah! if the treasuries of all
the sultans of the world were brought together they could not
afford gems equal to these." When somewhat recovered from his
surprise, he inquired of his viziers how he should now act
towards Abou Neeut; when they all unanimously cried out, "By all
means give him your daughter." The marriage was then immediately
celebrated with great splendour, and Abou Neeut conducted himself
so well in his high station, that the sultan his father-in-law
committed to him the giving public audience in his stead, and the
decision of all appeals, three days in each week.</p>

<p id="id04356">Some time had elapsed after his elevation, when Abou Neeut one
day giving audience in the magnificent hall of one of his country
palaces, beheld a man among the crowd of a sorrowful aspect,
dressed in a wretched habit, who cried, "O true believers, O
charitable gentlemen, relieve the distressed!" Abou Neeut
commanded one of his mace-bearers to bring him to his presence,
and on his appearance recognized his treacherous companion who
had left him in the well. Without making himself known, or
betraying any emotion but that of compassion, he ordered
attendants to conduct him to the warm bath; in which being
refreshed, he was arrayed in a magnificent habit, and again
brought to the divan. Abou Neeut having retired with him into a
closet, said, "Knowest them me not, my old friend?" "No, by
Allah," replied the other. "Know then," returned he, "that I am
Abou Neeut, thy benefactor and companion, whom you treacherously
left in the well." He then related all his adventures, concluding
them with an assurance, that so far from resenting his treachery,
he regarded his conduit as the impulse of fate, and as the means
by which he, himself, had attained his present dignity and
affluence, which he would share with him. The envious heart of
Abou Neeuteen was unconquerable; and instead of thanking the
noble-minded Abou Neeut for his forgiveness and liberality, he
exclaimed, "Since the well has been to thee so fortunate, why
should it not prove so also to me?" Having said this, he hastily
rose up and quitted Abou Neeut, who would not punish such
rudeness, even without taking leave.</p>

<p id="id04357">Abou Neeuteen hastened with all speed to the well, and having
descended by a rope, sat down, impatiently expecting the arrival
of the Afreets, who about midnight alighted, and resting
themselves on the terrace above, began to inquire each other's
adventures. "Since we met last," said one, "I have been rendered
miserable; for a cunning Mussulmaun found out the secret of
overpowering me, and has married my princess, nor can I revenge
myself, for he is under the protection of a converted genie, whom
the prophet has appointed to watch over him." "I," continued the
other Afreet, "have been equally unfortunate with thyself; for
the same man who has wedded thy mistress discovered my hidden
treasure, and keeps it in spite of my attempts to recover it: but
let us fill up this abominable well, which must have been the
cause of all our disasters." Having said thus, the two Afreets
immediately hurled the terrace and large stones into the well,
which crushed the ungrateful and envious Abou Neeuteen to atoms.
Some days after this, the good Abou Neeut, finding he did not
return, repaired to the well, and seeing it fallen in, ordered it
to be cleared; when the discovery of the body proved to him that
the malicious spirit of the wretch had been the cause of his own
destruction. He with reverence exclaimed, "There is no refuge but
with the Almighty; may he preserve us from envy, which is
destructive to the envious alone!"</p>

<p id="id04358">Abou Neeut returned to the capital, where, not long after, his
father-in-law the sultan dying, left him heir to his kingdom. His
succession was disputed by the husbands of the two elder sisters
of his wife; but the ministers and people being in favour of the
sultan's will, they resigned their pretensions and submitted to
his authority. His wife being brought to bed of a son, her
sisters bribed the midwife to pretend that the sultana had
produced a dog. They did the same by another son. At the third
lying-in of the sultana Abou Neeut resolved to be present, and a
beautiful princess appeared. The two infant princes having been
thrown at the gate of one of the royal palaces, were taken up by
the gardener and his wife, who brought them up as their own. Abou
Neeut in visiting the garden with his daughter, who shewed an
instinctive affection for them, from this, and their martial play
with each other (having made horses of clay, bows and arrows,
&amp;c.), was induced to inquire of the gardener whether they were
really his own children. The gardener upon this related the
circumstance of his having found them exposed at the gate of the
palace, and mentioned the times, which agreed exactly with those
of the sultana's delivery. Abou Neeut then questioned the
midwife, who confessed the imposition and wickedness of the
sisters, whom he left to be punished by the pangs of their own
consciences, convinced that envy is its own severest tormentor.
The young princes were acknowledged; and the good Abou Neeut had
the satisfaction of seeing them grow up to follow his example.</p>

<h2 id="id04359" style="margin-top: 4em">              ADVENTURE OF A COURTIER, RELATED BY
           HIMSELF TO HIS PATRON, AN AMEER OF EGYPT.</h2>

<p id="id04360" style="margin-top: 3em">It is related by an historian that there was an ameer of the land
of Egypt, whose mind being one night unusually disturbed, he sent
for one of his courtiers, a convivial companion, and said to him,
"To-night my bosom, from what cause I know not, is uncommonly
restless, and I wish thee to divert me by some amusing
narrative." The courtier replied, "To hear is to obey: I will
describe an adventure which I encountered in the youthful part of
my life."</p>

<p id="id04361">When a very young man I was deeply in love with a beautiful Arab
maiden, adorned by every elegance and grace, who resided with her
parents; and I used frequently to visit their camp, for her
family was one of the desert tribes. One day my mind felt
uncommonly anxious concerning her, and I resolved to seek relief
by a visit; but when I reached the spot found neither my beloved
nor any of her kindred. I questioned some passengers, who
informed me that the family had removed their encampment from
scarcity of forage for their herds and camels. I remained for
some time on the ground; but observing no signs of their return,
my impatience of absence became intolerable, and my love
compelled me to travel in search of my charmer. Though the shades
of evening were falling, I replaced the saddle upon my camel, put
on my vestments, and girding on my sabre proceeded. I had
advanced some distance, when the night became dismally black, and
from the darkness I now sunk into sands and hollows, and now
ascended declivities, while the yells of wild beasts resounded on
every quarter. My heart beat with apprehension, and my tongue did
not cease to repeat the attributes of the Almighty, our only
defender in time of need. At length stupor overcame my senses,
and I slept; while my camel quitted the track, and wandered from
the route I had meant to pursue all night. Suddenly my head was
violently intercepted by the branch of a tree, and I was awakened
by the blow, which gave me infinite pain. As I recovered myself I
beheld trees, verdure sprinkled with flowers, and a clear
rivulet; also a variety of birds, whose notes were melodiously
sweet. I alighted from my camel, and laid the bridle on my arm,
as the underwood of the thicket was closely entwined.</p>

<p id="id04362">I did not cease leading my camel till I was out of the thicket,
when I remounted; but at a loss which way to go, and unknowing
where Providence might direct me, I reached the desert, and cast
my eyes over the expanse; when, lo! at length a smoke appeared in
the midst of it. I whipped my camel, and at length reached a
fire, and near it observed a handsome tent, before which was a
standard planted, surrounded by spears, horses picketted, and
camels grazing. I said to myself, "What can mean this tent, which
has a grand appearance, in so solitary a plain?" I then went to
the rear of the tent, and exclaimed, "Health to you, O
inhabitants of this tent, and may the Almighty to you be
merciful!" Upon this there advanced from it a youth, seemingly
about nineteen, who appeared graceful as the rising moon, and
valour and benevolence gleamed upon his aspect. He returned my
salutation, and said, "Brother Arab, perchance thou hast missed
thy way." I answered, "Yes, shew it, and may God requite thee!"
upon which he replied, "My dwelling, brother Arab, is at present
in this wild spot; but the night is dreary, and shouldst thou
proceed there is no surety against wild beasts tearing thee in
pieces. Lodge, then, at present with me in safety, and repose,
and when day shall appear I will direct thee on thy way." I
alighted, when he took my camel, picketted her, and gave her
water and fodder. He then retired for a while; but returned with
a sheep, which he killed, flayed, and cut up; then lighted a
fire, and when it was of a proper glow broiled part of the sheep,
which he had previously seasoned with sundry dried herbs, seeds,
and spices, and when ready presented his cookery to me.</p>

<p id="id04363">During his hospitalities I observed that my kind host sometimes
beat his breast and wept, from which I guessed that he was in
love, and a wanderer, like myself. My curiosity was raised; but I
said within myself, "I am his guest, why should I intrude upon
him by painful questions?" and refrained from inquiry. When I had
eaten as much as sufficed me, the youth arose, went into his
tent, and brought out a basin and ewer, with a napkin embroidered
with silk and fringed with gold; also a cruet of rose water, in
which musk had been infused. I was astonished at his proceedings,
and the politeness of his demeanour, and exclaimed inwardly, "How
wonderful is the abode of so accomplished a personage in this
wild desert." We made our ablutions, and conversed awhile upon
various subjects; after which my gentle host went to his tent,
from whence he brought out a piece of red silk damask, which he
divided between us, saying, "Brother Arab, go into my tent and
choose thy place of repose, for last night and to-day great must
have been thy hardship and fatigue."</p>

<p id="id04364">I entered the tent, and in one partition of it found a mattress
of green damask: upon which, having pulled off my upper garments,
I lay down, and slept so soundly that I never enjoyed, before or
since, so refreshing a repose. At length I awoke, when night was
far advanced, and became involved in thought respecting my
hospitable host; but knew not what to conjecture, and was sinking
again into slumber, when, lo! gentle murmurs struck my ears, than
which I never heard sound more soft or tenderly affecting. I
lifted up the curtain of my partition, and looked around, when I
beheld a damsel more beautiful than any I had ever seen, seated
by the generous owner of the tent. They wept and complained of
the agonies of love, of separation and interruptions to their
desire of frequent meetings. Then I said within myself, "There is
a wonderfully dignified appearance in this amiable youth, yet he
lives alone, and I have seen no other tent on the plain. What can
I conjecture, but that this damsel must be a daughter of one of
the good genii, who has fallen in love with him, and upon her
account he has retired to this solitary spot?" Respect for their
love made me drop the curtain; I drew the coverlid over me, and
again fell asleep.</p>

<p id="id04365">When the morning dawned I awoke, dressed, and having performed my
ablutions and prayers, said to the young man, who had already
risen, "Brother Arab, if in addition to thy hospitalities already
shewn thou wilt put me in my way, my obligations will be
complete." He looked kindly, and said, "If convenient, my
brother, let me entertain thee as my guest for three days." I
could not refuse his hospitable request, and abode with him. On
the third day I ventured to inquire his name and family, when he
replied, "I am of the noble tribe of Azzra," and I discovered
that he was the son of my father's brother. "Son of my uncle,"
exclaimed I, "what can have induced thee to court the seclusion
of this desert spot, and to quit thy kinsmen, neighbours, and
dependents?"</p>

<p id="id04366">Upon hearing these words, the eyes of the youth became suffused
with tears, he sighed, and said, "Ah! my cousin, I passionately
admired the daughter of my uncle, and was so devoted to her love
that I asked her in marriage; but he refused me, and wedded her
to another of our tribe richer than myself, who carried her to
his abode. When she was thus torn from me, despair agitated my
soul, I quitted my relations, friends, and companions, became
enamoured of solitude, and retired to this lonely spot."</p>

<p id="id04367">When he had finished his communication, I said, "But where is the
abode of thy beloved and thy successful rival?" He replied, "Near
the summit of yonder mountain, from whence, as frequently as
opportunity will allow, in the stillness of night, when sleep
hath overpowered the eyes of the village, she ventures to my
tent, and we enjoy the company of each other; but believe me, my
brother, our passion is innocent as devotional love. Hence I
dwell here in the manner you have witnessed, and while she visits
me delightful will pass the hours, until Allah shall execute his
appointed decrees, and reward our constancy in this world, or
consign us to the grave together."</p>

<p id="id04368">When the unfortunate youth had concluded his narration, at which
I was affected with sincere compassion for his circumstances, an
eager desire to relieve the lovers from their oppressors occupied
my mind, and after much consideration I addressed him thus: "If
thou choosest, I think I can point out a plan which, under the
blessing of Allah, may end the sufferings of thyself and thy
beloved." He replied, "O son of my uncle, reveal it to me!" and I
continued, saying, "When night shall arrive, and the damsel
cometh, let us seat her upon my camel; for she is sure-footed and
swift of pace; do thou then mount thy steed, and I will accompany
you upon one of your camels. We will travel all night, and ere
morning shall have passed the forest, when you will be safe, and
thy heart will be rendered happy with thy beloved. The land of
God is wide enough to afford us an asylum; and by Heaven I swear,
that while life remains I will be thy friend." The youth replied,
"Son of my uncle, I will consult upon thy plan with my beloved,
for she is prudent and well-informed."</p>

<p id="id04369">When night had shut in, and the usual hour of the damsel's coming
approached, my kind host impatiently expected her arrival; but in
vain, for she did not appear. He rose, stood in the doorway of
the tent, opened his mouth, and drew in the exhalations of the
gale, then returned, sat down pensively for a few minutes, and at
last bursting into tears, exclaimed, "Ah! my cousin, there are no
tidings of the daughter of my uncle, some, mishap must have
befallen her. Remain here while I go in search of intelligence."
Having said thus, he took up his sabre, his lance, and departed.</p>

<p id="id04370">When somewhat more than an hour had elapsed, I heard his
footstep, and soon perceived him advancing, bearing something
bulky in his arms, while he called loudly upon me in a
distressful tone. I hastened towards him, and upon my arrival he
exclaimed, "Alas, alas! the beloved daughter of my uncle is no
more, and I bear her remains. She was hastening, as usual, to my
tent, when suddenly a lion sprung upon her in the path, and tore
her in pieces. These relics are all that remain of my beloved."
He then laid them down, and, lo! the thigh bones of the damsel
and part of her ribs. He wept piteously, and said, "Remain here
till I return;" after which he departed with the swiftness of an
arrow. In about an hour he returned, and in his hand was the head
of the lion, which he threw down, and asked eagerly for water,
which I brought him. He then washed his hands, cleansed the mouth
of the lion, which he rapturously kissed, and wept bitterly for
some moments. He then exclaimed, "By Allah, I conjure thee, O son
of my uncle, and by the ties of relationship between us, that
thou observe my will; for within this hour I shall follow my
beloved; be thou our mourner, and bury her remains with mine in
the same grave." Having said this, he retired into the sleeping
partition of the tent; where he remained at his devotions for an
hour, then came out, beat his breast, sighed deeply, and at
length heaved his expiring groan, saying, "I come, I come, my
beloved, I come!" and his pure soul took flight for the mansions
of Paradise.</p>

<p id="id04371">When I beheld his corpse, sad indeed was my condition, and from
excess of sorrow I found it difficult to perform my promise; but
at length I arose, washed, enshrouded, and laid the remains of
these constant lovers in the same grave, near which I remained
for three days in prayer and lamentation; after which I departed
homewards: but have not failed annually to visit the spot, to
bedew their grave with my tears, and pray for the mercy of Allah
to their souls and my own errors.</p>

<h2 id="id04372" style="margin-top: 4em">            STORY OF THE PRINCE OF SIND, AND FATIMA,
                 DAUGHTER OF AMIR BIN NAOMAUN.</h2>

<p id="id04373" style="margin-top: 3em">Some ages back a certain sultan of Sind had a son by a concubine,
who behaved so rudely to his sultana, that she became dispirited
and lost her health, which her favourite woman observing,
resolved by stratagem to get rid of the prince. She advised her
mistress, when he might next insult her, to say to him, "That he
would never appear becoming his rank till he was beloved by
Fatima, daughter of a sultan named Amir bin Naomaun." The queen
having followed the woman's directions, the prince resolved to
travel to the country of the princess, and demand her in
marriage. Accordingly, having obtained the consent of the sultan
his father, he departed with an attendance suitable to his rank.
After marching for some time he entered a desert, which was
covered with a numberless flight of locusts, that had fallen
exhausted for want of food. Pitying their distress, he ordered
meal to be spread on the ground, when the locusts having
refreshed themselves flew away. Some days after this incident he
reached a thick forest crowded with elephants, and herds of wild
animals of every description; but as they did not attempt to
attack him, and were in a starving condition, he ordered some of
his cattle to be killed, and distributed to them for food. Having
satisfied themselves they retired, shewing every sign that
dumbness would allow of being pleased with his kind treatment. On
his march onwards the prince met a venerable old man, of whom he
inquired the route to the territories of Amir bin Naomaun, and
was informed that they were at no great distance; but only to be
entered by a range of rugged and steep mountains composed of
iron-stone, and next to impassable; also, that should he succeed
in overcoming this difficulty, it was in vain to hope to attain
the princess. The prince inquiring the reason, the old man
continued, "Sultan Amir bin Naomaun has resolved that no one
shall wed his daughter unless he can perform three tasks which he
will impose, and these are of so difficult a nature as not to be
executed by the labour or ingenuity of man, and many unhappy
princes have lost their heads in the attempt; for he puts them to
death instantly on failure: be advised, therefore, and give up so
fruitless an expedition." The prince, instead of listening to the
admonition of the old man, resolved to proceed; and having
requested his prayers and benedictions, continued his march. In a
short time, having entered the passes of the mountains, he
discovered vast caverns inhabited by a species of genii, who were
employed in working upon masses of iron-stone, which they dug
from the rock. The prince having entertained them with a
hospitable feast, they, in return, shewed him the easiest route
through the stupendous mountains, and he at length arrived in
safety before the capital of sultan Amir bin Naomaun, to whom he
sent an envoy, requesting leave to encamp on the plain, and to
offer himself as a candidate for the beautiful princess his
daughter. The sultan, in reply, acceded to his petition, and
invited him to the palace; where, in the evening, he was led into
a court, in which was placed an immense vessel filled with three
kinds of grain mixed together, which (as his first task towards
obtaining the princess) he was to separate entirely from each
other, and put into three heaps; which if not accomplished before
sunrise, he was then to forfeit his head in punishment for his
temerity. It being now too late to recede, the prince resigned
himself to Providence; and the gates of the court being locked
upon him, he prayed to Allah, and began to separate the grains;
but finding his progress vain, his spirits deserted him about
midnight, and he left off his fruitless labour in despair,
endeavouring to reconcile himself to death. While he was praying
for fortitude to bear him up in his last moments, a voice was
heard, saying, "Be comforted, and receive the reward of thy
charity to famished insects." Immediately after this the heavens
were obscured, as if by thick clouds, which descended on the
court, when, lo! this phenomenon proved to be myriads of locusts;
who, alighting on the vessel, in a few hours emptied it of all
the grain, which they disposed of, each in its kind, in three
several heaps, and having given a general buzzing of salutation,
took flight, and vanished into the air. The prince was overjoyed
at the miraculous accomplishment of his task by the grateful
locusts, and having offered up thanks to Allah and the prophet
for his deliverance from impending destruction, composed himself
to rest, doubting not but that they would assist him to overcome
the two remaining labours. Great was the surprise of the sultan
Amir bin Naomaun, when, on coming at daylight to the court, he
beheld his intended victim in a profound sleep, and the grain in
three separate heaps, neatly piled up in the form of domes. The
prince awaking, saluted him, and demanded to be informed of his
next task; but the sultan put him off to the evening, until when
he entertained him at the palace with a most magnificent feast;
and his obdurate heart was so softened by the noble address and
demeanour of his guest, that he wished he might be able to
overcome the remaining impositions and become his son-in-law. The
princess, also, who had the curiosity to look at him through the
blinds of her apartments, was so fascinated with his appearance
that she prayed for his success.</p>

<p id="id04374">When night had set in, the prince was conducted to an open plain
in front of the palace, in the centre of which was a large
reservoir full of clear water, which the sultan commanded him to
drain off before sunrise, or forfeit his life. The prince
remained alone on the brink of the reservoir with rather somewhat
more hope of success than he had felt of overcoming his task of
the preceding night; nor was he disappointed, for about midnight
a voice was heard exclaiming, "Prince, benevolence is never
unrequited:" and, lo! the plain was filled with elephants,
rhinoceroses, camels, dromedaries, lions, tigers, and every
species of wild beasts, in such immense droves as could not be
numbered, who, advancing in turn to the reservoir, drank in such
quantity that it, at length, was completely emptied, and became
as dry as if just finished. The beasts then expressing pleasure
by their varying natural noises at having served their benefactor
departed, and left him to enjoy the deliverance from the labour
imposed upon him.</p>

<p id="id04375">The prince, now more assured than ever that he was the favourite
of Allah and the prophet, after offering up prayers with a
relieved heart, slept comfortably in a building creeled on the
margin of the reservoir, and was only awakened by the call of the
sultan at sun-rise, who was more astonished at the accomplishment
of this labour than the former, though certainly each was equally
difficult. He conducted the prince to his palace, and the day was
spent in the highest festivity.</p>

<p id="id04376">At the approach of night the prince was conducted to his third
task, which was to complete and fit up before daylight from a
vast mass of planks of the choicest timber ready stored the
doors, windows, and balconies of an unfinished palace, much
larger than that which the sultan inhabited. The prince at the
apprehension of the consequences of failure was somewhat alarmed;
but the recollection of his former aids supported him, and after
offering up his devotions he sat down, composedly waiting for the
decision of Providence on his fate. His resignation was accepted,
for at midnight he was roused from his contemplations by the
sounds of sawing, planing, hammering, nailing, and the songs of
happy work-men. Looking up he perceived his friends of the iron
mountains; who, all saluting him, cried out, "Prince, set your
heart at rest, for we are come to repay you for your hospitable
feast." Before daylight the palace was fitted up in a manner more
elegant than can be described, and every door, window, and
balcony painted with the most brilliant colours, flowered with
silver and gold. The grateful labourers of the iron mountains
having finished their work, respectfully saluted the prince and
departed.</p>

<p id="id04377">The prince having taken a grateful leave of his useful friends, walked
through the palace, and was eagerly employed in admiring its elegance
and the magnificence of their finishing hand, when the sultan Amir bin
Naomaun, who from his apartments at sun-rise had observed the
miraculous completion, appeared, having hastened to examine the superb
workmanship, and to congratulate his son-in-law, for as such he now
acknowledged him, and as the favoured of Allah, and of the last of
prophets. He conducted the prince to the palace, and the most
magnificent preparations being made, the nuptials with his daughter
were celebrated in the new edifice, where the bride and bridegroom
enjoyed themselves for three months, at the expiration of which the
prince begged permission to return to his father's dominions, which he
reached just in time to release him from the attack of an inimical
sultan, who had invaded the country, and laid close siege to his
capital. His father received him with rapture, and the prince having
made an apology to the sultana for his former rude behaviour, she
received his excuses, and having no child of her own readily adopted
him as her son; so that the royal family lived henceforth in the
utmost harmony, till the death of the sultan and sultana, when the
prince succeeded to the empire.</p>

<h2 id="id04378" style="margin-top: 4em">             STORY OF THE LOVERS OF SYRIA; OR, THE
                            HEROINE.</h2>

<p id="id04379" style="margin-top: 3em">There formerly dwelt in the city of Damascus two brothers, one
poor and the other rich, the former of whom had a son, and the
latter a daughter. The poor man dying left his son, just emerging
from infancy, to the protection of his wealthy uncle, who behaved
to his unfortunate charge with paternal tenderness, till the
youth, who had exchanged vows of love with his cousin, requested
her in marriage; when the father refused, and expelled him from
his house. The young lady, however, who ardently loved him,
agreed to elope, and having one night escaped from her father's
dwelling, repaired to the object of her affection; who, having
had notice of her intentions, had prepared two horses and a mule
to carry their baggage. They travelled all night, and by morning
reached a sea-port, where they found a ship ready to sail, in
which, having secured a passage, the lady immediately embarked;
but the lover remained on shore to dispose of the horses and
mule. While he was seeking for a purchaser in the market, a fair
wind sprung up, and the master of the ship having weighed anchor,
hoisted sail and departed: the lady in vain entreating him to
wait the return of her beloved, or send her on shore, for he was
captivated with her beauty. Finding herself thus ensnared, as she
was a woman of strong mind, instead of indulging in unavailing
complaint, she assumed a satisfied air; and as the only way to
preserve her honour, received the addresses of the treacherous
master with pretended complacency, and consented to receive him
as a husband at the first port at which the ship might touch.
With these assurances he was contented, and behaved to her with
honourable deference, and affectionate respect. At length the
vessel anchored near a city, to which the captain went to make
preparations for his marriage; but the lady, while he was on
shore, addressed the ship's crew, setting forth with such force
his treacherous conduct to herself, and offering such rewards if
they would convey her to her lover at the port they had left,
that the honest sailors were moved in her favour, agreed to obey
her as their mistress, and hoisting sail, left the master to
shift for himself. After some days of favourable weather, a
contrary gale blowing hard, the vessel was driven far out of her
course, and for shelter obliged to anchor in the first haven that
offered, which proved to be that of a large city, the capital of
a potent sultan, whose officers came on board to examine the
vessel, and inquire into her cargo and destination. These men, to
their great surprise, finding it commanded by a lady of exquisite
beauty, reported her charms to the sultan, who resolved to
possess them, and sent her an offer of marriage; to which she
seemingly consented, and the sultan commanded the most splendid
preparations to be made for the nuptials. When all was ready, he
sent onboard the vessel the daughter of his vizier, with other
ladies, thirty-nine in number, magnificently attired, to wait
upon his bride, and attend her on shore. They were graciously
received by the politic lady, and invited to refresh themselves
in the grand cabin, which she had elegantly adorned with costly
hangings, and prepared in it a superb collation, to which they
sat down. She then dismissed the boats in which they came,
sending a message to the sultan that she should entertain the
ladies on board till the next morning, when she would repair on
shore and conclude their marriage. She behaved towards her new
guests with such winning affability, that they one and all
admired their expected sultana, and partook of the entertainment
with the highest satisfaction; but what was their surprise when,
in the middle of the night, she commanded the crew to weigh
anchor, having first warned them, on pain of her displeasure and
immediate death, to keep silence, and raise no alarm in the
harbour. The vessel sailed, and put to sea without being
molested, when the intrepid commandress consoled the affrighted
ladies, related to them her own adventures, and assured them that
when she should have rejoined her lover, they should, if they
chose it, be honourably restored to their homes; but in the mean
time she hoped they would contentedly share her fortunes. This
behaviour, by degrees, so won upon their minds, that the ladies
forgot their sorrows, became pleased with their situation, and in
a short time were so attached to their new mistress, that they
would not have left her had it been in their power. After some
weeks sail, it became necessary to steer towards the first coast
that should present itself, to lay in a supply of fresh water and
provisions, and land appearing, the vessel anchored, when the
lady with her companions went on shore. Here they were surrounded
by forty robbers, who threatened to take them prisoners; when the
heroic lady, desiring her friends to conceal their fears, assumed
a smiling countenance, and addressing the chief of the banditti,
assured him there would be no occasion for force, as she and her
companions were ready to share their love, being women who were
above the prejudices of their sex, and had devoted themselves to
pleasure, in search of which they roved on board their vessel
from one coast to another, and would now stay with them as long
as they might wish for their company. This declaration suiting
the depraved minds of the robbers, they laid aside their fierce
looks and warlike weapons, bringing abundance of all sorts of
provisions to regale their expected mistresses, with whom they
sat down to a plentiful repast, which was heightened by a store
of wines which the lady had brought in her boats from the ship.
Mirth and jollity prevailed; but the fumes of the liquors, in
which the politic lady had infused strong opiates, suddenly
operated upon their senses, and they fell down one and all in a
state of stupefaction. She then with her companions drew the
sabres of their brutal admirers and put them all to death
excepting the chief, whom they bound hand and foot with strong
cords, and after cutting off his beard and mustachios, tied his
own cimeter round his neck, leaving him to feel mortification
worse than death on the recovery of his senses, namely, the sight
of his slaughtered fellows, and regret at the loss of his
imagined happiness. The ladies then stripped the caves of the
robbers of the vast wealth which they had hoarded up from their
plunders, and having carried it on board their boats, with a
stock of water and provisions, returned to the ship, weighed
anchor, and sailed triumphant and rejoicing from such a dangerous
coast. After some weeks' sail they again descried land, to which
they approached, and discovered a spacious harbour, round which
rose a vast city, the buildings of which were sublimely lofty,
adorned with flights of marble steps to the water's edge, and
crowned with domes and minarets topped with pinnacles of gold.
The enterprising lady having anchored, clothed herself and her
companions in magnificent male habits; after which she ordered
the boats to be hoisted out, and they were rowed ashore by part
of their crew richly dressed. On landing, they found all the
inhabitants of the city in mourning, and making doleful
lamentation for their late sultan, who had died only a few days
before. The gallant appearance of a stranger so nobly attended
created much surprise, and intelligence of the arrival was
instantly conveyed to the vizier, who acted as regent till the
election of a new monarch, which ceremony was just on the point
of taking place. The minister, who thought he perceived in such a
critical arrival the work of fate, immediately waited on the now
supposed prince, whom he invited to be present at the election;
at the same time informing him that when in this kingdom a sultan
died without issue, the laws appointed that his successor should
be chosen by the alighting of a bird on his shoulder, which bird
would be let fly among the crowd assembled in the square before
the palace. The seeming prince accepted the invitation, and with
the disguised ladies was conducted to a gorgeous pavilion, open
on all sides, to view the ceremony. The ominous bird being
loosened from his chain, soared into the air to a great height,
then gradually descending, flew round and round the square
repeatedly, even with the faces of the spectators. At length it
darted into the pavilion, where the lady and her companions were
seated, fluttered around her head, and at length rested upon her
shoulder, giving at the same time a cry of exultation, stretching
its neck, and flapping its wings. Immediately upon this, the
viziers and courtiers bowed themselves to the ground, and the
assembled crowd prostrated themselves on the earth, crying out,
"Long live our glorious sultan, the chosen of Providence, the
elected by the decrees of fate!" The disguised lady was instantly
conducted to the palace, seated on a splendid throne, and
proclaimed amidst the acclamations of the people, sovereign of an
extensive empire; nor were the abilities of her mind unequal to
the task of government. In a few days the vizier offered to the
supposed sultan his daughter in marriage; and his offer being
accepted, the nuptials were celebrated with the utmost
magnificence; but what was the astonishment of the bride, when,
instead of being caressed, the sultan on retiring with her became
cold and reserved, rose from her, and spent the night in prayer.
In the morning the sultana was questioned by her mother; who, on
her relating the behaviour of the husband, observed, that
possibly from his youth he might be over reserved; but that love
would naturally in time operate its effect. Several evenings past
in the same manner, when the bride, mortified at such coldness,
could no longer restrain herself, and said, "Why, my lord, if you
disliked me, did you take me to wife? but if you love not as
other men, tell me so, and I will suffer my misfortune in
silence." The lady, moved by this remonstrance, replied, "Most
virtuous princess, would that for your sake I were of the sex you
suppose me; but, alas! I am like you a woman, disappointed in
love." She then related to her the wonderful adventures she had
undergone since leaving her father's house, at which the vizier's
daughter was so affected that she vowed for her a lasting
friendship, agreed to keep her secret, and live with her till
such times as chance should restore her lover. In return for this
kindness the lady promised that should the object of her
affections ever arrive, he should marry them both, and that she
should have the precedence in the ceremony of union. The two
friends having thus agreed, the vizier's daughter regained her
cheerfulness, and means were taken to convince her father,
mother, and friends of the consummation of the nuptials. From
this time they lived in perfect happiness together, one
exercising the authority of sultan to the satisfaction of the
subject, and the other acting the part of a satisfied and
obedient wife; but still both were anxious to meet their mutual
husband. As the capital of the kingdom was a mart for most
nations of the world, the pretended sultan formed the following
stratagem for discovering her beloved, not doubting but that he
would travel over all parts of the world in search of the object
of his affection. She erected a most magnificent caravanserai,
furnished with baths hot and cold, and every convenience for the
weary traveller. When it was finished, she issued a proclamation,
that sojourners from all parts should be welcome to lodge in it,
and be provided with every necessary till they could accommodate
themselves in the city, or pursued, if only travellers, their
journey to another part. Over the gate of this edifice she placed
an exact statue of herself, and gave orders to the guards that
whatever stranger, on looking at it, should shew signs of
agitation, or utter words signifying that he knew the original,
should be immediately seized and confined in the palace. Many
weeks had not passed when the father of this enterprising lady,
who had travelled many thousands of miles in search of his
daughter, arrived at the gate, and on seeing the statue,
exclaimed, "Alas! alas! how like my poor, lost child!" He was
immediately carried to the palace, lodged in a magnificent
apartment, treated with the highest respect; but kept in complete
ignorance as to the cause of his confinement and his future fate.
Not long after this, his disconsolate nephew, who, on the
departure of the treacherous captain, had wandered from city to
city in hopes of finding his mistress, arrived, and repaired to
the caravanserai.</p>

<p id="id04380">On sight of the statue his feelings overcame him; he sighed and
fainted: when he was taken up by the guards and lodged in the
palace, where being come to himself, he was astonished at the
respect and attention paid him by the domestics, and the splendid
manner in which he was entertained; but it was in vain that he
inquired the cause of his detention, the only answer he could get
being, "Have patience, my lord, and repose yourself till
Providence shall free you from our confinement." Soon after this
the master of the ship, who had visited port after port in hopes
of recovering his vessel, reached the city, and hearing of the
hospitality with which all strangers were received at the
caravanserai of the sultan, repaired to the gateway; but no
sooner had he cast his eyes on the statue, than he exclaimed,
"Ah! how like to the artful yet virtuous woman who cheated me of
my property by stealing my ship." Immediately he was seized by
the guards, and conveyed to the palace, but treated with
kindness. Many days had not succeeded to this event, when the
sultan and the vizier, whose daughter with the thirty-nine ladies
had been so artfully carried away from them by the enterprising
heroine of this history, made their appearance at the gateway of
the caravanserai, and on beholding the statue, cried out, "Surely
this is the likeness of her who deprived us of our children; ah!
that we could find her and be revenged on her hypocrisy!" On
saying this they were apprehended and taken to the palace, where
they were conducted to apartments suitable to their rank. In a
few days afterwards the chief of the banditti, who, burning with
the ireful resolution of revenging the deaths of his associates,
had travelled from place to place in hopes of finding the object
of his fury, arrived at the gateway, and observing the statue,
roared out in a rage, "Surely this is the resemblance of my
tormenter; oh! that I could meet thy original, so that I might
have the satisfaction of making her blood atone for the murder of
my friends!" Instantly, as he had spoken, the guards at the gate
rushing upon him, bound him hand and foot, conveyed him to the
palace, where he was confined in a loathsome dungeon, and fed on
the coarsest viands.</p>

<p id="id04381">The pretended sultan having now all the parties in her power, one
morning ascended her throne in full audience, and commanded them
to be brought before her. When they had made their obeisance, she
commanded them to relate the cause of their having journeyed to
her capital; but the royal presence rendered them incapable of
uttering a word: upon which she exclaimed, "Since you cannot
speak, I will;" and then discovered to their astonished minds the
adventures of each, which had occasioned their travelling. She
then discovered herself, and fell upon the necks of her father
and lover, with whom she retired into the private apartments. The
sultan and his vizier were made happy in the company of the
daughter of the latter and the other ladies. The master of the
ship, as his troubles had atoned for his irregular behaviour, was
received into favour, and had his vessel restored; but the savage
chief of the banditti was put to death, by being cast into a
burning pile, that no further injury might be offered to mankind.
In a few days, the most magnificent preparations being made, the
double nuptials of the heroic lady and her friend the vizier's
daughter were celebrated with her constant lover, to whom she
resigned her throne, and the happy wives lived together in
felicity, undisturbed by jealousy of the husband's attention to
either, so equally did they share his love. The sultan and
vizier, after being long entertained at the court, took leave,
and returned, under an escort, to their own country; but the
daughter and the thirty-nine ladies could not be prevailed upon
to accompany them, only to visit and bid farewell to their
parents, for such was their attachment to their gallant mistress,
that they came back immediately, and were espoused to the
principle nobles of her court. Years of unusual happiness passed
over the heads of the fortunate adventurers of this history,
until death, the destroyer of all things, conducted them to a
grave which must one day be the resting-place for ages of us all,
till the receiving angel shall sound his trumpet.</p>

<h2 id="id04382" style="margin-top: 4em">           STORY OF HYJAUJE, THE TYRANNICAL GOVERNOR
                 OF COUFEH, AND THE YOUNG SYED.</h2>

<p id="id04383" style="margin-top: 3em">As Hyjauje (the Ommiad caliph) was was one day seated in his hall
of audience, surrounded by his nobles and dependents, tremblingly
awaiting his commands, for his countenance resembled that of an
enraged lion, there suddenly entered, unceremoniously, into the
assembly a beardless youth of noble but sickly aspect, arrayed in
tattered garments, for misfortune had changed his original
situation, and poverty had withered the freshness of his opening
youth. He made the customary obeisance to the governor, who
returned his salute, and said, "Who art thou, boy? what hast thou
to say, and wherefore hast thou intruded thyself into the company
of princes, as if thou wert invited? who art thou, and of whom
art thou the son?" "Of my father and mother," replied the youth.
"But how earnest thou here?" "In my clothes." "From whence?"
"From behind me." "Where art thou going?" "Before me." "Upon what
dost thou travel?" "Upon the earth" Hyjauje, vexed at the
pertness of the youth, exclaimed, "Quit this trifling, and inform
me whence thou comest." "From Egypt." "Art thou from Cairo?" "Why
askest thou?" said the boy? "Because," replied Hyjauje, "her
sands are of gold, and her river Nile miraculously fruitful; but
her women are wanton, free to every conqueror, and her men
unstable." "I am not from thence, but from Damascus," cried the
youth. "Then," said Hyjauje, "thou art from a most rebellious
place, filled with wretched inhabitants, a wavering race, neither
Jews nor Christians." "But I am not from thence," replied the
youth, "but from Khorassan." "That is a most impure country,"
said Hyjauje, "whose religion is worthless, for the inhabitants
are of all barbarians the most savage. Plunderers of flocks, they
know not mercy, their poor are greedy, and their rich men
misers." "I am not of them," cried the youth, "but of Moussul."
"Then," exclaimed Hyjauje, "thou art of an unnatural and
adulterous race, whose youths are catamites, and whose old men
are obstinate as asses." "But I am from Yemen," said the boy. "If
so," answered the tyrant, "thou belongest to a comfortless
region, where the most honourable profession is robbery, where
the middling ranks tan hides, and where a wretched poor spin wool
and weave coarse mantles." "But I am from Mecca," said the boy.
"Then," replied Hyjauje, "thou comest from a mine of
perverseness, stupidity, ignorance, and slothfulness; for from
among its people God raised up his prophet, whom they
disbelieved, rejected, and forced away to a strange nation, who
loved, venerated, and assisted him in spite of the men of Mecca.
But whence comest thou, youth? for thy pertness is become
troublesome, and my inclination leads me to punish thee for thy
impertinence." "Had I been assured that thou durst kill me,"
cried the youth, "I should not have appeared before thee; but
thou canst not." "Woe to thee, rash boy," exclaimed Hyjauje; "who
is he that can prevent my executing thee instantly?" "To thee be
thy woe," replied the youth: "he can prevent thee who directs man
and his inmost thoughts, and who never falsifieth his gracious
promises." "He it is," cried the tyrant, "who instigates me to
put thee to death." "Withhold thy blaspheming," replied the
youth; "it is not God, but Satan that prompts thy mind to my
murder, and with God I hope for refuge from the accursed: but
know, that I am from the glorious Medina, the seat of religion,
virtue, respectability, and honour, descended of the race of Bin
Ghalib, and family of Ali, son of Abou Talib, whom God has
glorified and approved, and will protect all his posterity, which
you would extirpate; but you cannot root it out, for it will
flourish even to the last day of the existence of this world."</p>

<p id="id04384">The tyrant was now overcome with rage, and commanded the youthful
Syed to be slain; but his nobles and officers interceded for him,
saying, while they bowed their necks before him, "Pardon, pardon;
behold our heads and our lives a ransom for his! For God's sake
accept our intercession, O ameer, for this youth is not deserving
of death." "Forbear your entreaties," exclaimed the tyrant, "for
were an angel to cry from Heaven, 'Do not slay him!' I would not
attend." Upon this the young Syed said, "Thou ravest, O Hyjauje;
who art thou that an angel should be commissioned for thy sake?"
The tyrant, struck with his magnanimity, became calm, and
commanding the executioner to release the youth, said, "For the
present I forbear, and will not kill thee unless thy answers to
my further questions shall deserve it." They then entered on the
following dialogue; Hyjauje hoping to entrap him in discourse.</p>

<p id="id04385">Hyjauje. How can the creature approach the perfection of the<br/>

Almighty?<br/></p>

<p id="id04386">Syed. By prayer, by fasting, by the commanded alms, by
pilgrimage, and fighting for the cause of God.</p>

<p id="id04387">H. I serve him by shedding the blood of infidel man. You pretend
that Hassan and Houssain, your ancestors, were descendants of the
prophet; but how can that be, when God has declared in the Koran
Mahummud was not of your obstinate race; but the prophet of God,
and last of divine messengers?</p>

<p id="id04388">S. Hear the answer to that in the verse following it. "Hath not a
prophet come unto you of your own nation? Receive him, and from
what he hath forbidden be forbidden." Surely, then, God hath
forbidden the shedding of the blood of him whom he sanctified.</p>

<p id="id04389">H. Thou hast spoken justly, young man; but inform me what God
hath daily and nightly commanded us as obligatory to do?</p>

<p id="id04390">S. To pray five times.</p>

<p id="id04391">H. What to observe in each year?</p>

<p id="id04392">S. To keep the month of Ramzaun as a fast.</p>

<p id="id04393">H. What to perform in the course of life?</p>

<p id="id04394">S. To make a pilgrimage to Mecca, the temple of God.</p>

<p id="id04395">H. Truly said; but what hath mostly dignified and enlightened<br/>

Arabia?<br/></p>

<p id="id04396">S. The tribe of Koreish.</p>

<p id="id04397">H. Wherefore?</p>

<p id="id04398">S. Because of our holy prophet's being a member of it.</p>

<p id="id04399">H. Who were the most skilful in horsemanship in all Arabia, the
most valiant, and of best conduct in war?</p>

<p id="id04400">S. The tribe of Hashim.</p>

<p id="id04401">H. Why think you so?</p>

<p id="id04402">S. Because my grandfather Imaum Ali, son of Abou Talib, was one
of it.</p>

<p id="id04403">H. What tribe of Arabs is most famous for benevolence, and
celebrated for liberality?</p>

<p id="id04404">S. The family of Tai.</p>

<p id="id04405">H. Wherefore?</p>

<p id="id04406">S. Because Hatim belonged to it.</p>

<p id="id04407">H. Which of the tribes have been most disgraceful to Arabia, and
most oppressive to its inhabitants?</p>

<p id="id04408">S. The tribe of Sukkeef.</p>

<p id="id04409">H. Why so?</p>

<p id="id04410">S. Because thou belongest to it.</p>

<p id="id04411">The tyrant could scarcely now contain his anger; but said, hoping
to cut the youth off from reply, "Tell me, is the Capricorn of
the heavens male or female?" To which he answered, "Shew me its
tail, that I may inform thee." The tyrant laughed, and continued
his questions as follows:</p>

<p id="id04412">H. Wert thou ever in love?</p>

<p id="id04413">S. Yes, completely immersed in it.</p>

<p id="id04414">H. With whom?</p>

<p id="id04415">S. With my God, who will, I trust, pardon me for my errors, and
deliver me from thee this day.</p>

<p id="id04416">H. Knowest thou thy God?</p>

<p id="id04417">S. Yes.</p>

<p id="id04418">H. By what means?</p>

<p id="id04419">S. By the scriptures, which he caused to descend to his prophet.</p>

<p id="id04420">H. Dost thou guard the Koran?</p>

<p id="id04421">S. Does it fly from me, that I should guard it?</p>

<p id="id04422">H. What dost thou learn from it?</p>

<p id="id04423">S. That God commanded its rules to be obeyed.</p>

<p id="id04424">H. Hast thou read and understood it?</p>

<p id="id04425">S. Yes.</p>

<p id="id04426">H. If so, tell me, first, What passage in it is most sublime.
Secondly, Which most commanding. Thirdly, Which most just.
Fourthly, Which most alarming. Fifthly, Which most encouraging.
Sixthly, That which Jews and Christians both believe in.
Seventhly, That in which God has spoken purely of himself; that
where he speaks of the angels; that in which he mentions the
prophets; that where he alludes to those destined to Paradise;
and that in which he speaks of those devoted to hell; that which
includes ten points; and that which Eblis the accursed delivered.</p>

<p id="id04427">S. By God's help I will answer thee. The most sublime passage is
the Koorsee: the most commanding, "God insisteth on justice:" the
most just, "Whoever diminishes the least of a measure, God will
requite him doubly, and the same to whoever addeth the least:"
the most alarming, "All expect to enter Paradise:" the most
encouraging, "O my servants, who have mortified yourselves,
despair not of the mercy of God!" that in which are ten points,
"God created the heavens and the earth, the revolutions of night
and day; also, the firmament over the waters that it might profit
man:" that which is believed alike by jews and christians, "The
Jew saith that the Christian is in error, and the Christian saith
that the Jew is mistaken, they both believe so; and both are in
error:" that in which God hath spoken purely of himself, "I have
not created genii and men but to worship me:" that in which he
speaks of the angels, "They said, we have no knowledge, but what
thou hast taught us; for thou only art wise and all-knowing:"
that which speaks of the prophets, "How could we deliver you a
verse without the order of God, on whom the faithful will rely:"
that which mentions the devoted to hell, "God hath cast us down
from heaven, for we were transgressors:" that which describes the
blessed, "Praised be God, who hath divested us of all sorrow, for
our Lord is merciful and gracious:" that which satan spoke, "None
will profit by thy mercy but thy servants the blessed."</p>

<p id="id04428">Hyjauje involuntarily exclaimed, "Praised be God, who giveth
wisdom to whom it pleaseth him; but I have found none so learned
of such tender age." Having thus spoken, he put many other
questions to the youth in every science, and he answered them so
readily that the tyrant was overcome with admiration, and offered
him a residence at his court; but the young man declined it, and
requested his dismission, which he granted, conferring upon him a
beautiful female slave richly habited, a thousand pieces of gold,
and a steed elegantly caparisoned. The courtiers were astonished
at the bounty of the tyrant, which he perceiving, said, "Be not
surprised, for the advice he hath given me was worthy of reward,
and 'Cursed is he who doth not requite a sincere adviser,'
declareth our sacred Koran."</p>

<h2 id="id04429" style="margin-top: 4em">              STORY OF INS AL WUJJOOD AND WIRD AL
             IKMAUM, DAUGHTER OF IBRAHIM, VIZIER TO
                        SULTAN SHAMIKH.</h2>

<p id="id04430" style="margin-top: 3em">Many ages past there was a very powerful sultan who had a vizier
named Ibrahim, and this minister had a daughter the most
beautiful of her sex and accomplished of her age, so that she
became distinguished by the appellation of Wird al Ikmaum, or the
rose among flowers. It was the custom of sultan Shamikh to hold
annually a general assembly of all the nobles of his kingdom, and
persons eminent for science or the arts, during which they were
magnificently entertained at the royal expense. The former
displayed their prowess in martial exercises before the
sovereign, and the latter the productions of their genius and
skill; when valuable prizes were bestowed by the arbitration of
appointed judges on those who deserved them. On one of the days
of this festival, the vizier's daughter from a latticed balcony
of the palace, in which she sat to view the sports, was so struck
with the manly figure and agility of a young nobleman named Ins
al Wujjood (or the perfection of human nature), that love took
possession of her mind. She pointed him out to a female
confidant, and gave her a letter to convey to the object of her
affections. The young nobleman, who had heard her praises, was
enraptured by his good fortune, and the next day, having obtained
as full a sight of her beauties as could be had through the
golden wires of the balcony, retired overcome by love. Letters
now passed daily, and almost hourly, between them; but they were
impatient for a meeting, which was at length planned; but the
note fixing the place and time was unfortunately dropped by the
confidant and carried to the vizier; who, alarmed for the honour
of his family, sent his daughter the same night to a far distant
castle belonging to himself, and situated on an island in a vast
lake, surrounded by mountainous deserts thinly inhabited. The
unfortunate lady was obliged to submit to her fate, but before
her departure contrived to write on the outside of her balcony
the following words, "They are carrying me off, but I know not
where." In the morning her lover repairing, as usual, in hopes of
seeing his mistress in the balcony, read the unwelcome
intelligence, which for a time deprived him of his senses. When
somewhat recovered he resolved to leave the court, though then
the chief favourite of the sultan, and go in search of his
beloved. Having put on the habit of a wandering devotee, he, on
the following evening, quitted the city, and recommending himself
to Providence, set out, but knew not whither. Many weeks did he
travel, but could find no traces of his beloved object; when
suddenly, passing through a thick forest, there met him a
monstrous lion, from whom he thought it impossible to escape, and
having uttered a prayer for the happiness of his beloved, and
repeated the testimony of martyrdom, he resigned himself to his
fate, and waited the spring of his expected devourer. What was
his surprise when the majestic animal, instead of making him his
prey, on approaching close to him, having looked compassionately
in his face, licked his hands, and turning round, walked gently
onwards, moving his head, as if to signify the youth should
follow him. Ins al Wujjood did so, and was conducted through the
forest by the lion; who, ascending a high mountain, suddenly
stopped at the entrance of a cave, to which was a door of iron,
then moving his head, and once more licking the hands of his
companion, the generous animal left him, and retired back to the
woods. The youth now went to the cave, and having knocked at the
door, it was opened by a venerable hermit, who bade him welcome,
brought him warm water to wash his feet, and set before him
refreshments of various kinds. When he had eaten, he inquired the
cause of his coming to such a desolate country; and Ins al
Wujjood having related his adventures, the old man exclaimed,
"Thou art a favourite of Heaven, or the lion would have devoured
thee; despair not, therefore, of success, for my mind presages
that thou wilt be happy, nor shalt thou want my assistance." Ins
al Wujjood having thanked him for his hospitality and generous
offers, the hermit informed him, that for nearly twenty years
past he had not beheld a human face till a few days prior to his
coming, when, wandering over the mountains, he had seen an
encampment on the margin of the great lake below, in which
appeared a crowd of men and women, some very richly habited, part
of whom had embarked on board a stately yacht, and the remainder
having taken leave of them, struck their tents, and returned by
the road they had come. "Most probably," said the hermit, "the
yacht may have conveyed thy mistress to the castle which stands
on an island in the middle of the lake, and if so thou shalt soon
be safely landed: for the rest Providence must be thy guide. I
will this night remember thee in my prayers, and meditate on what
can be done for thy benefit." Having said this, the hermit
conducted the wanderer to a chamber, and left him to his repose.</p>

<p id="id04431">The beautiful Wird al Ikmaum during this time remained
overwhelmed with uneasiness in her confinement, and it was in
vain that her attendants tried to amuse her. She wandered
melancholy through the magnificent gardens of the castle, the
groves of which were filled with every variety of birds, whose
harmony was delightful; but the soft cooing of the turtle dove
and the plaintive note of the lovelorn nightingale alone caught
her attention. To these she would listen for hours together,
reclined on a mossy bank, and fancy their pensive strains the
language of her beloved. Such was her daily employment, nor would
she quit the garden till forced by her attendants to take shelter
from the falling dews of night. We now return to her lover.</p>

<p id="id04432">Fatigue and the consoling assurances of the friendly hermit had
greatly composed the mind of Ins al Wujjood, who enjoyed a
refreshing sleep, nor did he awake till the sun was mounted high
in the heavens, when he joined his venerable host in his
devotions; after which they partook of a repast of bread, milk,
and fresh fruits. This ended, the old man requested him to fetch
from the forest a bundle of the filaments of palm bark, which,
when brought to him, he plaited into a shape resembling a little
boat, and giving it to Ins al Wujjood, said, "Repair to the lake,
and put this into the water, when it will become instantly large
enough to hold thee, then embark in it, and trust to Heaven for
the rest. Farewell!"</p>

<p id="id04433">Ins al Wujjood having taken leave of his venerable friend the
hermit, with many thanks, did as he had been commanded, and soon
arrived on the margin of the lake, into which he launched his
little vessel, when, to his great surprise, it instantaneously
became a handsome boat with the sails set. He got into it, and a
fair wind springing up was soon out of sight of land. For some
days he was wafted over the deep; but at length the shore of an
island appeared, on which he landed, and made his boat fast to
the trunk of a large tree. He then walked into the country, and
found it beautifully interspersed with green meadows, clear
streams, and shady groves of bending fruit trees, on the branches
of which all sorts of birds were warbling in their different
strains. Having refreshed himself with several fruits, he
proceeded onwards, and at length came in sight of a superb
edifice, to the gateway of which he advanced; but found it
locked. For three days he waited in hopes of seeing some of its
inhabitants, but in vain. However on the fourth morning the gate
was opened by a man, who seeing Ins al Wujjood, advanced towards
him, and inquired who he was, whence he came, and what was his
reason for waiting at the gate. "I am of Ispahaun," replied Ins
al Wujjood, "and was shipwrecked in a trading voyage upon this
coast, to the shore of which I alone of all my companions had the
good fortune to escape." Upon hearing this the man burst into
tears, embraced him, and said, "May God preserve thee from future
calamities! I am also a native of Ispahaun, where also dwelt my
cousin, whom I dearly loved, and by whom I was beloved. At this
happy period of my youth a nation stronger than ours made war
against us, overcame us, and among other captives forced me from
my country; after which they sold me as a slave to my present
master: but come, my dear countryman, enter the palace, and
repose thyself in my apartment, where we will endeavour to
console each other under our misfortunes till Providence shall
restore us to our homes."</p>

<p id="id04434">Ins al Wujjood gladly accepted such a friendly invitation, and on
entering the court beheld a lofty and wide-spreading tree, from
the branches of which were suspended several golden cages, each
inhabited by a beautiful bird, and each striving to rival the
other in melody, as if in welcome of his approach. He inquired of
his host to whom the splendid edifice belonged, and was informed
to the vizier of sultan Shamikh; who, to secure his daughter from
the vicissitudes of fortune, had lodged her here, and only
visited her annually to inquire after her health, and bring the
necessary supplies for her convenience and the support of her
attendants in the castle. Upon hearing the above circumstances,
Ins al Wujjood was nearly overcome with ecstacy; but restraining
his feelings, exclaimed to himself, "At length I have reached the
abode of my beloved, and may hope for success;" which was yet,
however, afar off. His charming mistress, little thinking that
her lover was so near, and weary of absence and the solitude of
her abode, had that very evening resolved to escape from
confinement. In the darkness of night she accordingly let herself
down from the battlements by a silken rope, which she had twisted
from slips of various robes, and reached the ground unhurt. With
haste she fled towards the sea shore, where she perceived a
fishing boat, the owner of which, though at first alarmed,
supposing her, from her dazzling appearance (for she was covered
with jewels), to be an ensnaring genie, at length, on her
assurances that she was really a woman, admitted her into his
vessel. She thanked him for his kindness, which she rewarded by
the gift of many rich jewels, and requested to be conveyed across
the lake. The fisherman hoisted sail, and for some hours the wind
was prosperous; but now a heavy tempest arose, which tossed them
constantly in imminent danger for three days, and drove them far
from their intended course. At length the gale subsided, the sea
became assuaged, and land appeared. As they approached the shore
a stately city rose to their view, the buildings of which seemed
unusually magnificent. Under the terrace of the sultan's palace
they safely, at last, cast anchor; and it chanced that the
prince, who was named Dara, was then sitting with his daughter in
a balcony to enjoy the fresh sea breeze, and the view of the
extensive harbour, crowded with the vessels of every country.
Perceiving the boat, the sultan commanded his officers to bring
the master and his crew to the presence. Great was his surprise
at the introduction of the beautiful Wird al Ikmaum. From her
rich dress, dignified air, and demeanour, he concluded her to be
of superior rank, and having seated her near his daughter, he
graciously requested to be informed of the name of her country,
and the cause of her having travelled to his capital; to which
she replied in eloquent language, giving a summary detail of all
her adventures. The sultan consoled her by encouraging assurances
of his protection, promised to exert his authority to effect a
union with her beloved, and immediately dispatched his vizier
with costly presents to sultan Shamikh, requesting him to send
Ins al Wujjood to his court.</p>

<p id="id04435">The vizier, after a prosperous voyage, having reached the capital
of sultan Shamikh, presented his offerings, and made known the
request of his master; to which the sultan replied, That nearly a
year had elapsed since Ins al Wujjood had, to his great regret,
absented himself from his court, nor had any tidings been
obtained of the place of his retirement; but that he would order
his vizier to accompany the ambassador in search of his retreat,
being willing to oblige his master the sultan to the utmost of
his power. Accordingly, after a repose of some days, the two
viziers departed in search of Ins al Wujjood, but without knowing
where to bend their journey. At length they reached the shore of
the ocean of Kunnooz, on which they embarked in a hired vessel,
and sailed to the mountainous island of Tukkalla, of which the
vizier of sultan Shamikh gave to his companion the following
account. "This island was some ages back inhabited by genii; a
princess of whom became violently enamoured of a handsome young
man, a son of an ameer of the city of Misr, or Cairo, whom she
beheld in her flight sleeping in his father's garden in the heat
of the day. She sat down by him, and having gently awoke him, the
youth, on looking up, to his astonishment and rapture saw a most
beautiful damsel who courted his addresses: he was not backward
in offering them; and mutual protestations of love and constancy
took place. After some hours of happiness the genie princess took
an affectionate leave, promising soon to visit him again, and
vanished from sight. The youth remained musing on his fortunate
adventure till the dews of night began to fall, when his parents,
fearful of some injury, sent attendants to conduct him to their
palace, but he refused to go; and talked, as it appeared to them,
so incoherently concerning his beloved, that they thought him
distracted; seized him roughly, and forced him homewards. His
father and mother were alarmed: it was in vain that they courted
him to partake of refreshment; he was sullen and gloomy, and at
length abruptly retired to his chamber, where he remained in
restless anxiety all night, waiting impatiently for morning, that
he might revisit the happy spot where his charmer had promised
again to meet him.</p>

<p id="id04436">"At early dawn the ameer's son repaired to the garden, and was
soon gratified with the sight of his beloved; but while they were
exchanging mutual protestations of regard, the mother of the
genie princess, who had suspected from her daughter's conduct
that she was carrying on some intrigue, and had followed her in
the air unperceived, suddenly appeared. Rushing upon the lovers,
she seized her daughter by the hair, beat, and abused her in the
harshest language for having disgraced the honour of the genii by
an amour with a wretched son of mortality: to all which the genie
princess replied, that her remonstrances were vain; she had fixed
her affections, and would rather be torn into a thousand pieces
than desert the object of her heart. The mother upon this finding
the case desperate, and being herself softened by the uncommon
beauty of the youth, who had fallen at her feet, entreating mercy
for his beloved, at length relented, and agreed to sanctify their
loves by her consent to their marriage. It was accordingly
celebrated; and this island, which after the name of the genie
princess was called Tukkalla, was fixed upon for the place of
their residence. Its magnificent palace still remains, after the
lapse of many ages, and is at present in my possession. Here I
hope to meet my only daughter, whom I brought to reside in it
nearly a year ago, to secure her from the attempts of a young
courtier, on whom she had, against my consent, fixed her
affections."</p>

<p id="id04437">The two viziers now disembarked, and proceeded up the island; but
what was the astonishment and mortification of Ibrahim on
learning, when he arrived at the palace, that his daughter had
escaped, nor had the attendants heard of her since her departure,
though they had repeatedly searched every quarter of the island.
Perceiving among his attendants whom he had left at the palace a
strange young man of pallid countenance, wasted frame, and
melancholy air, the vizier inquired how he had come among them;
and received for reply, that he was a shipwrecked merchant of
Ispahaun, whom they had taken in for the sake of charity. Ibrahim
now requested of the vizier of sultan Dara that he would return
to his master, and inform him of their vain search after Ins al
Wujjood; at the same time desiring him to receive into his suite
the supposed merchant as far as the city of Ispahaun, which lay
in his route. To this the vizier of sultan Dara consented: and
the two ministers having taken a friendly leave of each other
separated, and departed for their several capitals.</p>

<p id="id04438">The vizier of sultan Dara, in the course of the journey, became
so pleased with the agreeable manners of the supposed merchant,
that he often conversed with him familiarly; and at length the
young man, emboldened by his condescending attention, ventured to
inquire the cause of his travels to regions so distant from his
own country: upon which he was informed of the arrival of the
beautiful Wird al Ikmaum at the court of sultan Dara; of the
compassion of that sultan for her misfortunes; his generous
protection; and his own fruitless mission in search of her lover
Ins al Wujjood. A this happy intelligence, the latter, overcome
with ecstacy, could no longer contain himself, but discovered who
he was; and the vizier was also overjoyed at knowing, when least
expected, that he had found the despaired of object of his long
journey. He embraced the young man, congratulated him upon the
speedy termination of absence from his beloved, and the happy
union which awaited him. He then made him an inmate of his own
tents, supplied him with rich attire, and every necessary
becoming the condition of a person for whose fortunes he knew his
sovereign to be so highly concerned. Ins al Wujjood, now easy in
mind, and renovated by the happy prospects before him, daily
recovered health and strength, so that by the time of their
arrival at the capital of sultan Dara he had regained his
pristine manliness and vigour.</p>

<p id="id04439">When the vizier waited upon his master the sultan Dara to
communicate his successful commission, the sultan commanded the
youth to his presence. Ins al Wujjood performed the usual
obeisance of kissing the ground before the throne, with the
graceful demeanour of one who had been used to a court. The
sultan graciously returned his salutation, and commanded him to
be seated; after which he requested him to relate his adventures,
which he did in eloquent language, interspersing in his narrative
poetical quotations, and extempore verses applicable to the
various incidents and situations. The sultan was charmed with his
story; and when he had finished its relation, sent for a cauzee
and witnesses to tie the marriage knot between the happy Ins al
Wujjood and the beautiful Wird al Ikmaum; at the same time
dispatching a messenger to announce the celebration of the
nuptials to sultan Shamikh and Ibrahim his vizier, who were
bewailing their supposed irrecoverable losses; one that of his
favourite, and the latter that of his daughter. Sultan Dara
detained the happy couple at his court for some time, after which
he dismissed them with valuable presents to their own country,
which they reached in safety, and were received with the most
heart-felt rejoicings by the sultan and the repentant vizier, who
now recompensed them by his kindness for the former cruelty of
his behaviour towards them; so that in favour with the sultan,
and happy in their own family, the lovers henceforth enjoyed
every earthly felicity, sweetened by the reflection on past
distresses, till the angel of death summoned them to submit to
the final destination of mortality.</p>

<h2 id="id04440" style="margin-top: 4em">             THE ADVENTURES OF MAZIN OF KHORASSAUN.</h2>

<p id="id04441" style="margin-top: 3em">In ancient days there resided in the city of Khorassaun a youth
named Mazin, who, though brought up by his mother, a poor widow,
to the humble occupation of a dyer, was so celebrated for his
personal accomplishments and capacity as to become the admiration
of crowds, who daily flocked to his shop to enjoy the pleasure of
his conversation. This young man was as good as he was able, nor
did flattery take away his humility, or make him dissatisfied
with his laborious occupation, which he followed with industry
unceasing, and maintained his mother and himself decently from
the fruits of his labour. So delicate was his taste in the choice
of colours, that veils, turbans, and vests of Mazin's dyeing were
sought after by all the young and gay of Khorassaun; and many of
the females would often cast a wishful glance at him from under
their veils as they gave him their orders. Mazin, however, was
destined by fate not always to remain a dyer, but for higher
fortunes and surprising adventures.</p>

<p id="id04442">As he was one day busy in his occupation, a man of Hijjem came to
his shop, and after looking at him earnestly for some moments,
exclaimed, "Alas, that such a noble youth should be confined to
drudge at so mean an employment!" "I thank you, father, for your
compassion," replied Mazin, "but honest industry can never be
disgraceful." "True," said the old man of Hijjem, "yet if
Providence puts affluence and distinction in our way, should we
refuse it?" "By no means," said Mazin; "canst thou point me out
the way to it without making me forfeit my integrity? If so, I
assure thee I am not so fond of my trade but I would be glad to
live at ease in an honest manner without it; for I should like to
enjoy leisure to follow my studies, which have already gained me
some little celebrity." "Son," said the Hijjemmee, "thy wishes
shall be satisfied: thou hast no father, but I will be one to
thee; from this instant I adopt thee as my son. I possess the art
of transmuting common metals into gold: be ready at thy shop
early in the morning, when I will meet thee. Farewell!" Having
thus said, the old man took leave.</p>

<p id="id04443">Mazin's curiosity and ambition were raised: he shut up his shop
sooner than usual, and returned with a full heart to his mother,
to whom he communicated the offered kindness of the Hijjemmee.
The good woman, after some moments of reflection, said, "Son, I
fear some evil lurks under this apparent kindness, for we live in
wicked days, when men profess more than they mean to do for the
sake of attaining an object; be cautious then, and do not till
thou hast proof of his sincerity regard his office. We have at
present all we want, and what can riches give more?" Mazin agreed
to the propriety of his mother's advice, and promised to be wary.
They ate their usual cheerful meal, and retired to rest; but the
young man could sleep but little, and he longed with impatience
for the morning that was to put him into possession of the art of
transmuting metals into gold.</p>

<p id="id04444">The morning arrived, and Mazin repaired impatiently to his shop,
where he had soon after the satisfaction of seeing his adopted
father, who came bearing in his hands a crucible. "Welcome, son!"
"Welcome, father!" was the mutual salutation; after which the
Hijjemmee desired Mazin to kindle a fire: he did so, when the old
man inquired of Mazin if he had any old metal, iron, brass,
copper, &amp;c. Mazin produced some pieces of an old pot of the
latter metal, which were put into the crucible. When melted, the
Hijiemmee took from his turban a paper containing powder of a
yellowish hue, which he threw into the crucible, over which he
repeated some cabalistic words while he stirred the melting
metal. At length he took it from the fire, and to his
astonishment Mazin beheld a large lump of pure gold, which the
Hijiemmee desired him to carry to a goldsmith's and get it
exchanged for coin He did did so, and received a handsome sum,
with which he returned to his adopted father.</p>

<p id="id04445">"Well, my son," said the Hijjemmee, "art thou now convinced of my
skill, and my sincerity in offering to promote thy fortunes?" "I
am," said Mazin, "and am ready to follow wherever thou choosest,
in hopes of learning this invaluable secret" "That shall soon be
thine," replied the transmuter of metals; "I will sup with thee
this evening, and in the privacy of retirement give thee the
necessary instruction." Mazin, overjoyed, immediately shut up his
shop, and with his adopted father repaired to his own house,
where he seated him in his best apartment. He then went to his
mother, desiring that she would go and spend the night at a
neighbour's, shewing her the gold which his broken copper had
procured, as a proof of the sincerity of his new friend. The old
lady no longer doubted upon such evidence, and cheerfully took
leave and departed to a friend's house.</p>

<p id="id04446">Mazin next went to a cook's shop, from which he returned laden
with every sort of refreshment, nor was wine forgotten, though
forbidden to the faithful. The adopted father and son ate
heartily, at the same time pushing about the spirit-stirring
liquor, till at last Mazin, who had not been used to drink wine,
became intoxicated. The wily magician, for such in fact was his
pretended friend, watching his opportunity, infused into the
goblet of his unsuspecting host a certain potent drug, which
Mazin had scarcely drunk oft, when he fell back upon his cushion
totally insensible, the treacherous wizard tumbled him into a
large chest, and shutting the lid, locked it. He then ransacked
the apartments of the house of every thing portable worth having,
which, with the gold, he put into another chest, then fetching in
porters, he made them take up the chests and follow him to the
seaside, where a vessel waited his orders to sail, and embarked
with the unfortunate Mazin and his plunder. The anchor was
weighed, and the wind being fair, the ship was soon out of sight
of the land.</p>

<p id="id04447">Mazin's mother early in the morning returning to her house found the
door open, her son missing, and the rooms ransacked of all her
valuables. She gave a loud shriek, tore her hair, beat her bosom, and
threw herself on the ground, crying out for her son, who she thought
must have been murdered by the treacherous magician, against whose
professions she had warned him to be cautious, till the sight of the
transmuted gold had deceived her, as well as the unfortunate victim of
his accursed arts. Some neighbours hearing her lamentations rushed in,
lifted her from the ground, and inquired the cause of her distress;
which, when informed of, they endeavoured to alleviate by every
consolation in their power, but in vain: the afflicted old lady was
not to be comforted. She commanded a tombstone to be raised in the
court-yard, over which she sat night and day bewailing her son, taking
scarcely food sufficient to preserve her miserable existence.</p>

<p id="id04448">The infidel Hijjemmee, who was a wicked magician and a worshipper
of fire, by name Bharam, hated the true believers, one of whom
annually for several years past he had inveigled by his offers of
instructing in the science of transmuting metals into his power;
and after making him subservient to his purposes in procuring the
ingredients necessary for his art, had treacherously put him to
death, lest the secret should be divulged: such was now his
intention towards the unfortunate Mazin.</p>

<p id="id04449">On the evening of the second day after the sailing of the vessel,
Bharam thought proper to awaken his victim to a sense of his
misery. He opened the chest, which had been placed in his cabin,
and poured a certain liquid down the throat of Mazin, who
instantly sneezed several times; then opening his eyes, gazed for
some minutes wildly around him. At length, seeing the magician,
observing the sea, and feeling the motion of the ship, his mind
surmised to him the misfortune which had happened; and he guessed
his having fallen into the snares of the treacherous Bharam,
against which his mother had warned him, but in vain. Still,
being a virtuous Mussulmaun, he would not complain against the
decrees of Heaven; and instead of lamentation uttered the
following verse of the sacred Koran: "There is no support or
refuge but from the Almighty, whose we are, and to whom we must
return. Deal gently with me, O my God, in the dictates of thy
omnipotence; and make me resigned under thy chastening, O Lord of
all being."</p>

<p id="id04450">Having finished the above prayer, Mazin turning humbly towards
his accursed betrayer, said in a supplicating tone, "What hast
thou done, my father? didst thou not promise me enjoyment and
pleasure?" The magician, after striking him, with a scowling and
malignant sneer, exclaimed, "Thou dog! son of a dog! my pleasure
is in thy destruction. Nine and thirty such ill-devoted wretches
as thyself have I already sacrificed, and thou shalt make the
fortieth victim to my enjoyment, unless thou wilt abjure thy
faith, and become, like me, a worshipper of the sacred fire, in
which case thou shalt be my son, and I will teach thee the art of
making gold." "Cursed be thou, thy religion, and thy art,"
exclaimed the enraged Mazin: "God forbid that for the pleasures
of this world I should apostatize from our holy prophet, and give
up the glorious rewards reserved in certain store for his
faithful disciples. Thou mayest indeed destroy my body, but my
soul despises thy torments" "Vile dog!" roared out the now
furious sorcerer, "I will try thy constancy." He then called in
his slaves, who held Mazin on the floor of the cabin while their
abominable master beat him with a knotted whip till he was
covered with a gore of blood, but the resolute youth, instead of
complaining, uttered only prayers to Heaven for divine support
under his pangs, and strength of fortitude to acquire the glory
of martyrdom. At length the magician, exhausted by his cruel
exercise, desisted, and making his slaves load his unfortunate
victim with heavy fetters, chained him down with only a coarse
mat to lie upon in a dark closet, in which was placed some
stinking water and coarse bread, just sufficient to keep up his
miserable existence. Mazin's courage was not to be overcome He
washed his wounds, and comforted himself with the hope that if he
died he should enjoy the blisses of Paradise, or if Providence
had decreed his continuance in life, that the same Providence
would present a mode of relief from his present and future
afflictions. In this assurance he took a little of his wretched
fare, and in spite of the agony of his wounds fell asleep, but
only to awake to fresh misery In the morning he was again
persecuted by his cruel tormentor, who for three months daily
harassed him with blows, with revilings, and every sort of insult
that malice could invent or cruelty devise.</p>

<p id="id04451">Hitherto the wind had been fair, and the vessel had nearly
reached the desired haven, when suddenly it changed, and a most
tremendous storm arose The waves threatened to swallow up or dash
the vessel in pieces, so that all gave themselves over for lost.
At this crisis the sailors, who believed that the tempest was
sent by Heaven as a judgment for their suffering the unfortunate
Mazin to be so cruelly tormented, went in a body to the accursed
Bharam, and accused him of having brought down the wrath of God
upon the crew by his persecution of the young Mussulmaun; at the
same time threatening to cast him overboard if he did not
instantly release the youth from his confinement. To show the
seriousness of their resolves, the sailors seized the slaves who
had been the instruments of the magician's cruelty, and threw
them into the sea, which so alarmed the treacherous Bharam that
he immediately released Mazin from his chains, fell at his feet,
begging pardon for his hard usage, and promising if they escaped
the storm to conduct him safely to his own country, and fulfil
his promise of instructing him in the secret of making gold.
Wonderful to relate! But no sooner was Mazin freed from his
fetters than the violence of the tempest lessened, by degrees the
winds subsided, the waves abated their swell, and the sea no
longer threatened to overwhelm them: in a few hours all was calm
and security, and a prosperous gale enabled the shattered vessel
to resume her course.</p>

<p id="id04452">The sailors now regarding Mazin as one immediately befriended by
Heaven, treated him with the greatest respect and attention; and
the hypocritical magician pretending sorrow for his late
cruelties, strove to procure his forgiveness and good opinion by
every art of flattery and affected contrition; which had such an
effect on the ingenuous youth that he forgot his treachery, again
believed his fair promises and assurances that the torments he
had undergone had only been inflicted as trials of his constancy
and belief in the true religion, virtues necessary to be proved
before the grand secret of transmuting metals could be trusted to
his keeping.</p>

<p id="id04453">The remainder of the voyage was prosperous and happy, and at the
expiration of three months more the vessel anchored on the wished
for coast, which was rocky, and the beach strewed with pebbles of
every colour. The magician having given orders to the master of
the vessel to wait a month for their return, disembarked with
Mazin, and they proceeded together into the country. When they
had got out of sight of the ship the magician sat down, and
taking from his vestband a small drum, began to beat upon it with
two sticks, when instantly a whirlwind arose, and a thick column
of dust rolled towards them from the desert. Mazin was alarmed,
and began to repent having left the vessel; when the magician,
seeing his colour change, desired him to calm his apprehensions,
for which there was no cause, that he had only to obey his orders
and be happy. He had scarcely spoken when the wind ceased, the
dust dispersed, and three camels stood before them, one of which
was laden with water and provisions; the others were bridled and
very richly caparisoned. Bharam having mounted one, and, at his
desire, Mazin the other, they travelled without ceasing, except
to take the necessary refreshment and repose, for seven days and
nights successively over a wild and sandy desert.</p>

<p id="id04454">On the eighth morning they reached a beautifully fertile tract,
delightfully watered by clear streams; the ground verdant, shaded
by spreading trees laden with fruit, on whose branches various
birds warbled melodiously, and beneath them antelopes and other
forest animals sported unmolested. At the end of a thick avenue
rose to view a capacious dome of blue and green enamel, resting
upon four columns of solid gold, each pillar exceeding in value
the treasures of the sovereigns of Persia and Greece. They
approached the dome, stopped their camels and dismounted, and
turned the animals to graze. This splendid building was
surrounded by a delightful garden, in which the now happy Mazin
and the magician reposed themselves all that day and night. At
some distance from this enchanting spot appeared a stupendous
fabric, whose numerous turrets and lofty pinnacles glittered to
the eye, and denoted a palace of uncommon magnificence, so that
the curiosity of Mazin was raised, and he could not help
inquiring of his companion to whom such a superb edifice might
belong. The magician, rather roughly, desired him for the present
to ask no questions concerning a place which belonged to his most
bitter enemies, who were evil genii, and of whom at a proper time
he would give him the history. Mazin was silent, but from the
magician's manner he began to forbode some new treachery.</p>

<p id="id04455">In the morning Bharam beat his magical drum, and the three camels
appealed, when Mazin and his companion mounted, pursuing their
journey in the same manner as before for seven days, with a speed
more resembling flight than the pace of travel, for their camels
were supernatural. On the eighth morning the magician inquired of
Mazin what he saw on the horizon. "I behold," said he, "to
appearance, a range of thick black clouds extending from east to
west." "They are not clouds," replied Bharam, "but lofty
mountains, called the Jubbal al Sohaub, or mountains of clouds,
from their cloud-like appearance, on their summit lies the object
of our journey, which with thy assistance we shall soon obtain,
and return to our vessel more enriched than all the sovereigns of
the world, but thou must be sure to obey me in whatever I may
command." Mazin promised to do so, but his heart trembled within
him as he beheld the gloomy prospect before him, and recollected
the boast which the accursed magician had made of his having
sacrificed thirty-nine youthful victims on these mountains, and
also his threat on board the ship to make the fortieth offering
of himself. He repented of having trusted himself from the
vessel, but it was now too late to recede. He resigned himself to
the same Providence who had relieved his sufferings in his
voyage, and concealed, as well as he could, his uneasiness from
the magician, who now endeavoured to sooth and flatter him with
artful promises and caresses.</p>

<p id="id04456">For four days longer they pursued their route, when it was
stopped by the black mountains, which formed, as it were, a wall
inaccessible, for the precipices were perpendicular, as if
scarped by art, and their tremendous height cast a dark and
gloomy shade to a vast distance. They now dismounted, and turned
their camels to graze, when the magician took out of his package
three loaves and a sum of water, after which he lighted a fire;
then having beat his talismanic drum, the camels again appeared,
the smallest of which he killed, embowelled, and carefully flayed
off the skin, the inside of which he washed with water. Having
done thus, he addressed Mazin, saying, "My son, the task must now
be thine to crown our labours with success. Enter this skin, with
these loaves and this water bag for thy sustenance while thou
remainest on the summit of the mountain. Be not afraid, for no
harm can happen I will sew up the skin, leaving room enough for
the admission of air. By and by a roc will descend, and seizing
it in her talons carry thee easily through the air. When she
shall have alighted on the table-land of the mountain, rip open
the stitches of the skin with thy dagger, and the roc on seeing
thee will be instantly scared, and fly far away. Then arise,
gather as much as possible of a black dust which thou wilt find
thickly strewed on the ground; put it into this bag, and throw it
down to me, after which I will contrive an easy means for thy
descent, and when thou hast rejoined me we will return to our
vessel, and I will convey thee safely back to thy own country.
The dust, which has the quality of transmuting metals into gold,
we will share between us, and shall each have enough to rival all
the treasuries on earth."</p>

<p id="id04457">Mazin finding it in vain to oppose, allowed himself to be sewn up
in the camel's skin with the loaves and water, recommending
himself by mental prayer to the protection of Allah and his
prophet. The magician having finished his work retired to some
distance, when, as he had said, a monstrous roc, darting from a
craggy precipice, descended with the rapidity of lightning,
grasped the skin in her widely extended talons, and soaring
swifter than the eagle soon alighted on the table-land of the
mountain; when Mazin, feeling himself on the ground, ripped the
stitches of his dangerous enclosure, and the roc being alarmed,
uttered a loud scream and flew away. Mazin now arose, and walked
upon the surface of the mountain, which he found covered with
black dust; but he beheld also the skeletons of the young men
whom the accursed Bharam, after they had served his purpose, had
left to perish. His blood became chilled with horror at the view,
as he apprehended the same unhappy fate: he however filled his
bag with the black powder, and advanced to the edge of a
precipice, from which he beheld the magician eagerly looking
upwards to discover him. Mazin called out; and when the hypocrite
saw him, he began dancing and capering for joy, at the same time
exclaiming, "Welcome, welcome, my son! my best friend, beloved
child! all our dangers are now over, throw me down the bag." "I
will not," said Mazin, "but will give it thee when thou hast
conveyed me safely from this perilous summit." "That is not in my
power," answered Bharam, "till I shall have the bag: cast it
down, and I swear by the fire which I worship immediately to
procure thee a safe descent." Mazin, relying on his oath, and
seeing no other chance of escape, cast down the bag; which having
taken up, the accursed sorcerer mounted his camel and was
departing. The unhappy Mazin in agony called after him, saying,
"Surely thou wilt not forfeit thy oath, nor leave me to perish!"
"Perish thou must, Mussulmaun dog!" exclaimed the treacherous
magician, "that my secret may be kept, nor can thy boasted
prophet save thee from destruction; for around thee are mountains
impassable, and below a fathomless sea. I have obtained what I
wished, and leave thee to thy fate." Having said thus he speeded
onwards, and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p id="id04458">Mazin was now in an agony of despair, not a ray of hope comforted
his mind; he beat his bosom, threw himself on the ground amid the
mouldering skeletons of the former victims to the treachery of
the magician, and lay for some time in a state of insensibility.
At length the calls of hunger and thirst forced him back to a
sense of wretched existence; and the love of life, however
miserable, made him have recourse to his water and his loaves.
Being somewhat revived, religion came to his aid, and he began to
pray for resignation to submit to the decrees of Heaven, however
painful. He then walked to the edge of the mountain overhanging
the sea, which he observed to wash the base of the rock without
any beach, at sight of which a desperate chance of escape struck
his mind: this was, to throw himself from the precipice into the
ocean, in hopes, should he survive the fall and rise to the
surface, he might reach land. He commended himself to God, shut
his eyes, held in his breath, and giving a desperate spring,
plunged headlong into the dreadful abyss, which providentially
received him unhurt, and a friendly wave drove him on shore;
where, however, he remained some minutes in a lifeless stupor,
owing to the rapidity of his descent from the brain-sickening
precipice.</p>

<p id="id04459">When his senses returned Mazin looked wildly around him, at first
scarcely able to bear the light from the recollection of the
dizzy eminence from which he had plunged; and an uneasy interval
elapsed before he could persuade himself that the certainty of
death was past. Convinced at length of this, he prostrated
himself to the earth, and exclaimed, "In God alone is our refuge
and support! I thought I should have perished, but his providence
has sustained me." He then wept exceedingly, entreated
forgiveness of his offences, read several passages from the
Koran, which he had preserved in his vestband, repeated the whole
of his rosary, and besought the intercession of the prophet for
his deliverance from future dangers. After this he walked onwards
till evening, the fruits of the forest his food, his drink the
water of the streams, and his resting place the green turf. Such
was his progress, that after three days he reached the spot under
the mountain where he had been taken up by the roc in the camel's
skin. He now recognized the road he had come; and after measuring
back his steps for nine days, beheld on the last the superb
palace, concerning which he had inquired of the magician, who had
informed him it was inhabited by evil genii, his most bitter
enemies.</p>

<p id="id04460">For some time Mazin hesitated whether he should advance to the
gates of the palace; but considering that no greater calamity
could happen to him than he had already endured, he contemned
danger, and boldly advanced to a grand lodge built of white
marble exquisitely polished. He entered, and beheld on one of the
raised platforms which skirted the passage into the court two
beautiful damsels playing at the game of chess; one of whom on
beholding him exclaimed, "Surely, sister, this is the young man
who passed this way about a month ago with Bharam the magician?"
"I am he!" exclaimed Mazin, at the same time throwing himself at
her feet, "and entreat your hospitable protection." The lady,
raising him from the ground, said, "Stranger, you resemble so
much a once beloved brother, that I feel inclined to adopt thee
as such, if my sister will also agree to do so." The other lady
readily assented. They then embraced Mazin, seated him between
them, and requested to be informed of his adventures, of which he
gave them a true narration.</p>

<p id="id04461">When Mazin had concluded his story, the ladies expressed
compassion for his misfortunes, and the strongest resentment
against the accursed magician, whom they vowed to punish by a
tormenting death for having had the insolence to accuse them of
being evil genii. They then proceeded to acquaint him with the
cause of their residence in this secluded palace, saying,
"Brother, for as such we shall henceforward regard you, our
father is a most potent sultan of a race of good genii, who were
converted by Solomon, the son of David, to the true faith; we are
seven daughters by the same mother; but for some cause which we
do not know the sultan our father, being fearful of our becoming
connected with mankind, has placed us in this solitary spot. This
palace was erected by genii for our accommodation; the meadows
and forests around it are delightful, and we often amuse
ourselves with field sports, there being plenty of every sort of
game, as you must have observed. When we want horses or camels we
have only to beat a small magical drum, and they instantly attend
our call, ready caparisoned. Our five sisters are at present at
the chase, but will soon return. Set thy heart at rest, forget
thy misfortunes, which are now at an end, and thou shall live
with us in ease and pleasure."</p>

<p id="id04462">The five sisters soon returned, and Mazin's adventures being
recounted to them they also adopted him as their brother; and he
continued with these ladies, who strove to divert him all in
their power by repeated rounds of amusements: one day they
hunted, another hawked, another fished, and their indoor
pleasures were varied and delightful; so that Mazin soon
recovered his health, and was happy to the extent of his wishes.
A year had elapsed, when Mazin one day riding out for his
amusement to the enamelled dome supported on four golden columns,
perceived under it the accursed magician, and with him a youth,
whom, like himself, he had inveigled into his snares, and devoted
also to destruction. The rage of Mazin was kindled at the sight;
he drew his sabre, and rushing unperceived behind the sorcerer,
who was in the act of flaying a camel for the purposes already
described, seized him by his hair, and exclaimed, "Wretch! the
judgment of Heaven at length hath overtaken thee, and soon shall
thy impure soul be plunged into that fire thou hast blasphemously
adored." The magician struggled, but in vain. He then implored
for mercy and forgiveness; but Mazin, convinced by experience
that he deserved none, struck off his head at one blow. Then
informing the intended victim, who stood near gazing with
astonishment, of the wicked arts of the accursed Bharam, and of
his own narrow escape from almost certain destruction, he advised
the young man to remount his camel, and return to the spot where
he had disembarked from the vessel, which would safely convey him
back to his own country. The youth, having thanked him for his
deliverance, took his leave; and Mazin returned to the palace,
carrying with him the head of the magician as a trophy of his
victory. He was highly applauded for his prowess by the sisters,
who rejoiced in the destruction of so cruel an enemy to mankind.</p>

<p id="id04463">Many days had not elapsed after this event, when one morning
Mazin and the sisters sitting together in a gallery of the
palace, observed a thick cloud of dust rising from the desert and
approaching towards them. As it came nearer they perceived
through it a troop of horsemen; upon which the sisters, desiring
Mazin to retire into an inner chamber, went to the gateway to
inquire who the strangers might be. They were servants of the
genie sultan, father to the ladies, and sent by him to conduct
them to his presence, in order to attend the nuptials of a near
relation. Upon this summons the sisters prepared for the journey,
and at the end of three days departed, assuring Mazin that they
would return in a month. At taking leave they gave him the keys
of every apartment in the palace, telling him that he might open
every door except one, which to enter might be attended with
unpleasant consequences, and therefore had better be avoided.
Mazin promised to observe their caution; and for many days was so
well amused in examining the magnificent rooms and curiosities of
the palace, that he did not feel a wish to transgress till the
forbidden door alone remained unopened. Having then nothing to
divert him, he could not resist the impulse of curiosity, but
unlocked the door, which opened on a marble staircase by which he
ascended to the terraced roof of the palace, from whence a most
delightful prospect feasted his sight. On one side his eye was
arrested by an extensive garden, in the centre of which, under
shady trees, was a basin of clear water, lined with gems of every
colour and description. He resolved to visit this enchanting
object; and descending the staircase, explored his way through a
long arcade, which led him at length into the garden, in which he
diverted himself with the scenery it afforded for some time. He
then retired to an alcove on the margin of the basin, and sat
down; but had not rested many moments, when to his astonishment
he beheld descending from the sky a company of beautiful damsels,
whose robes of light green silk floating in the air seemed their
only support. Alarmed at such a preternatural appearance, he
retired to the end of the alcove, from whence he watched their
motions. They alighted on the brink of the water, and having
thrown off their robes, stood to the enraptured view of Mazin in
native loveliness. Never had he beheld such enchanting beauty;
but one even more exquisitely charming than the rest attracted
his gaze, and from the instant fixed the affections of his heart.
They now plunged into the basin, where for some time they amused
themselves by swimming, every now and then playfully dashing the
water over themselves and at each other. When satiated with
frolic they came out of the water, sat for some time on the
verdant margin, then dressed themselves, and adjusting their
robes to the air, soared aloft, and were soon far from the sight
of the enamoured Mazin, who followed them till his eyes could
stretch no farther; then despairing of ever again beholding the
object of his affections, he fainted on the grass, and it was
some time before he recovered his senses. He returned melancholy
to the palace, and spent the night in reposeless agitation.</p>

<p id="id04464">The following morning the seven sisters returned; and she who had
first welcomed him to their abode, and had ever since retained
for Mazin the purest affection, ran with eagerness to inquire
after his health. Great was her affliction on beholding him upon
his bed, pale, and apparently in a state of rapid decay. After
many kind questions, to which he returned no answers, she
entreated earnestly, by the vow of brotherly and sisterly
adoption which had past between them, that he would inform her of
the cause of his unhappy dejection; assuring him that she would
use every exertion to remove it, and gratify his wishes, be they
what they might, however difficult to be obtained. Mazin upon
this, in a feeble tone, related his adventure in the garden; and
declared that unless the beautiful (he supposed celestial) damsel
could be obtained for him he must die of grief. The sister bade
him be comforted, for in a short time his desires should be
satisfied, which revived his spirits, and he accompanied his kind
hostess to welcome home her sisters, who received him with their
usual hospitality, but were grieved and alarmed at the sad
alteration in his appearance, of which they inquired the reason,
and were informed that it was the effect of absence from his
generous patronesses.</p>

<p id="id04465">The next morning the sisters went upon a hunting excursion for
ten days, only one (his kindest friend) remained in the palace,
under pretence of attending Mazin, whose health, she said, was
too delicate to bear the exercise of the chase. When the others
were departed, she informed Mazin that the beautiful beings he
had seen in the garden were of a race of genie much more powerful
than her own, that they inhabited a country surrounded by seas
and deserts not to be approached by human exertion, that the
ladies he beheld were sisters to the queen of these genii, whose
subjects were entirely female, occasionally visited by male
genii, with whom they were in alliance for the sake of
population, and to whom all the males were sent away as soon as
born. She further told him, that these females had the power,
from their silken robes, of soaring through the air with a flight
an hundred times swifter than that of any bird, that they were
fond of recreating in verdant spots, and bathing in the clearest
waters, and that the garden he had seen them in was a favourite
place of their resort, so that they would probably soon visit it
again. "Possibly," continued she, "they may recreate themselves
there to-day; we will be on the watch, and if they appear, you
must fix your eye on your favourite, mark where she places her
robes, and while they are in the water seize and conceal them,
for deprived of these she cannot fly away, and you may make her
your prisoner. Bring her to the palace, and endeavour by
tenderness and endearing attention to gain her affection and
consent to marriage; but remember when she is in your power to
keep her robes from her, for should she regain possession of them
she would certainly return to the Flying Islands, and you would
see her no more."</p>

<p id="id04466">Mazin and his adopted sister now repaired to the garden, and
seated themselves in the alcove, nor had they been there long
when the fair genii appeared as before, descended on the margin
of the basin, and all having undressed, each laying her robes by
themselves, rushed playfully into the water, in which they began
to swim, dive, and besprinkle playfully each other. Mazin, whose
eager eye had ardently watched his beloved, swiftly, but
cautiously, snatching up the robes of his mistress, conveyed them
to the alcove unobserved by the fair bathers; who, when they had
sufficiently amused themselves, quitted the water, and ascending
the bank, began to dress; but how can we describe the distressful
confusion of the unhappy genie whose robes had been stolen? Big
tears rolled down her beautiful cheeks, she beat her bosom, tore
her hair, and uttered loud shrieks, while her sisters, instead of
consoling her, were concerned only for their own safety, and
dressing themselves with confused haste, bade her farewell,
mounted into the air, and disappeared. On their departure, Mazin
and his adopted sister approached, and saluting the disconsolate
genie endeavoured to console her, but for the present in vain,
her mind being intent only on the sad captivity she thought
awaited her, and the loss of her native country and relations.
They led her gently to the palace, and Mazin, retiring
respectfully, left her to the care of his adopted sister, who by
a thousand endearments and attentions so gained upon her, that in
two days the genie began to recover her spirits, and consented to
receive Mazin as her husband, when the ladies should return from
the chase. On their arrival at the palace they were informed by
their sisters of what had happened, and introduced to the fair
stranger; who, diverted by their company and attentions, now
scarcely regretted her captivity. Preparations were made for the
nuptials, and in a short time Mazin was made happy in the
possession of his beloved genie. A round of festivities succeeded
their marriage, and the seven sisters strove with each other who
should by invention of new amusements make their residence among
them most delightful to the happy pair Mazin, however, now began
to think of his mother and his native city with fond regret, and
at length begged leave of his kind patronesses to return home, to
which request they, from admiration of his filial love, though
unwilling to part, consented, and a day was fixed for his
departure. The time being arrived, the sisters beat their magical
drum, when several camels appeared at the gates of the palace
heavily laden with the richest goods, a large sum of money,
valuable jewels, and refreshments for the journey, led by proper
attendants. One camel carried a splendid litter for the
conveyance of his wife, and another was richly caparisoned for
the use of Mazin, who, having taken an affectionate leave of his
generous benefactresses, whom he promised to revisit at some
future time, departed, and pursued the route back towards the sea
shore, where he had disembarked with the magician. On the journey
nothing remarkable occurred, and on their arrival at the coast
they found a vessel ready to receive them, when the wind proving
fair, a short time carried them safely to Bussorah, where Mazin
had the satisfaction of finding his mother alive, though greatly
wasted with constant grief and lamentation for his loss. To
describe the joy of their meeting is impossible, for never was
there more tender affection between parent and child than
subsisted between Mazin and his mother. She seemed to gain new
life from his recovery, and again to grow young. The fair genie,
who was now in the way of being a mother, appeared perfectly
contented in her situation, and Mazin, so unexpectedly restored
to his country, was happy in the possession of all he wished; for
the generous sisters had bestowed such wealth upon him, that, in
addition to the domestic felicity he enjoyed, he was now one of
the richest persons in all Bussorah.</p>

<p id="id04467">Three years had rolled away in undisturbed happiness, during
which the fair genie had borne him two sons, when Mazin thought
it grateful to perform his promise to the seven sisters, the
benevolent foundresses of his good fortune. Having accordingly
made preparations for his journey, he committed his wife's native
robes to the care of his mother, giving her the key of a secret
recess in which he had lodged them, but with a strict charge not
to let the genie put them on, lest an irresistible impulse might
inspire her to fly away to her own country; for though in general
she had seemed contented, he had heard her now and then express a
wish to be again with her own friends and species. The mother
promised obedience, and Mazin having taken an affectionate leave
of her, his wife and children, with assurances of speedy return,
embarked on board a vessel and pursued his voyage, which was
uncommonly prosperous. On his landing he found camels waiting his
arrival on the beach, for the genie ladies, by magic arts, knew
of his coming, and had stationed them for his conveyance to their
palace, which he reached in safety, and was received with the
most affectionate welcomes and hospitality.</p>

<p id="id04468">Some time after the departure of Mazin, his wife requested her
mother-in-law's permission to amuse herself at a public bath, and
the old lady willingly accompanied her and the children to the
most celebrated hummaum in the city, which was frequented by the
ladies and those of the chief personages of the court, the caliph
Haroon al Rusheed then happening to be at Bussorah. When they
reached the bath there were then in it some of the principal
female slaves, attendants of Zobeide, who, on the entrance of
Mazin's wife, were struck with her uncommon beauty, and instantly
collecting round her, rapturously gazed upon her as she was
undressing.</p>

<p id="id04469">The slaves of Zobeide did not cease to admire Mazin's wife till
she left the hummaum, and even followed her till she entered her
own house, when dusk had begun to gloom, and they became
apprehensive of their mistress's being displeased at their long
absence, and so it happened.</p>

<p id="id04470">Upon entering into her presence, Zobeide exclaimed, "Where have
ye loitered, and what has been the cause of your unusually long
stay at the hummaum?" Upon which they looked confusedly at each
other, and remained silent. The sultana then said in anger,
"Instantly inform me of the cause of your delay!" when they
related the wonderful beauty of Mazin's wife, and dwelt so much
upon her charms, that Zobeide was overcome by curiosity to behold
them. On the following day she sent for the mother of Mazin, who
obeyed the summons with fear and trembling, wondering what could
have made the caliph's consort desirous of seeing a person of her
inferior rank.</p>

<p id="id04471">Mazin's mother prostrated herself, and kissed the feet of the
sultana, who graciously raising her, said, "Am Mazin, our wish is
that you introduce to me your son's wife, of whose beauty I have
heard such a description, that I long to behold her."</p>

<p id="id04472">When the mother of Mazin heard these words, her heart sunk within
her, she trembled, but dared not refuse the command of Zobeide,
and she said, "To hear is to obey!" after which she took leave,
with the usual ceremony of prostration before the throne of the
sultana.</p>

<p id="id04473">When the mother of Mazin left the princess Zobeide she returned
towards her own house; and when she had reached it, entered to
her son's wife, and said, "Our sultana Zobeide hath invited thee
to an entertainment." The wife of Mazin was delighted, instantly
rose up, arrayed herself in the richest apparel she was mistress
of, and dressed her two children in their choicest garments and
ornaments Then with them, the mother of her husband, and a black
slave, she proceeded, till they reached the palace of the
princess Zobeide, which they entered, and found her sitting in
impatient expectation. They kissed the ground be fore her, and
prayed for her prosperity.</p>

<p id="id04474">When the sultana Zobeide beheld the wife of Mazin her senses were
confounded, her heart fluttered, she was astonished at her
beauty, elegance, graceful stature, and blooming complexion, and
exclaimed, "Gracious heaven! Where could such a form as this have
been created?" Then she seated her guests, and ordered a
collation to be brought in, which was done immediately, when they
ate and were satisfied, but Zobeide could not keep her eyes from
the wife of Mazin of Bussorah. She kissed her, and questioned her
concerning what had befallen herself and her husband. Her
astonishment was redoubled on the relation of their adventures.</p>

<p id="id04475">The wife of Mazin then said, "My princess, if you are thus
surprised, though you have not seen me in my native robes, how
would you be delighted at my appearance in them! If, therefore,
you wish to gratify your curiosity by beholding a miracle, you
must command the mother of my husband to bring my country dress."
Upon this Zobeide commanded the mother of Mazin to fetch the
flying robes, and as she dared not disobey the sultana of the
caliph, she went home, and speedily returned with them. Zobeide
took them into her hands, examined them, and was surprised at
their fashion and texture. At length she gave them to the wife of
Mazin.</p>

<p id="id04476">When the wife of Mazin had received the robes, she unfolded them,
and going into the open court of the palace, arrayed herself in
them, then taking her children in her arms, mounted with them
suddenly into the air. When she had ascended to about the height
of sixty feet, she called out to the mother of her husband,
saying, "Give my adieu, dear mother, to my lord, and tell him,
should ardent love for me affect him he may come to me in the
islands of Waak al Waak." After this speech she soared towards
the clouds, till she was hidden from their eyes, and speeded to
her own country.</p>

<p id="id04477">When the mother of Mazin beheld her in the air, she beat her
cheeks, scattered dust upon her head, and cried aloud to the
princess Zobeide, "This is thy mischief." Zobeide was not able to
answer or reprove her boldness from the excess of her sorrow and
regret, which made her repent, when repentance could not avail.
The old lady returned in despair to her own habitation.</p>

<p id="id04478">Thus it happened to the persons above mentioned, but how was it
with the affairs of Mazin? He did not cease travelling for some
time, till he arrived at the palace of the seven sisters, and
paid his respects. They were rejoiced at his arrival, and
inquired after his wife, when he informed them she was well, and
that God had blessed him with two children, both sons, which
added to their satisfaction. He remained with them for some time,
after which he entreated their permission to depart. They took a
tender leave of him, when he bade them farewell, and returned
towards his own country; nor did he halt till he arrived in
safety at Bussorah. When he entered his house he found his mother
alone, mournfully weeping and lamenting what had happened in his
absence. Seeing her in this state, he inquired the cause, upon
which she informed him of all that had occurred, from the
beginning to the conclusion.</p>

<p id="id04479">When Mazin had heard the unwelcome intelligence, he cried out in
an agony of distress for the loss of his wife and children, fell
fainting to the ground, and forgot his own existence. His mother,
on beholding his condition, beat her cheeks, and sprinkled water
upon his face till he came to himself, when he wept and said to
his mother, "Inform me what my wife may have spoken on her
departure." She repeated her farewell words: upon hearing which
his distress and ardent longing for his wife and children was
redoubled. He remained mournfully at home for the space of ten
days, after which he resolved upon the journey to the islands of
Waak al Waak, distant from Bussorah one hundred and fifty years
of travel.</p>

<p id="id04480">Mazin departed from his mother after he had taken leave and
entreated her prayers for his success, but the aged matron was so
affected that she ordered her tomb to be prepared, and did
nothing but weep and lament night and day for her son, who did
not halt till he had reached the palace of the seven sisters.
When they saw him they were surprised, and said to one another,
"There must be some urgent cause for his returning so speedily."
They saluted him, and inquired after his affairs: upon which he
informed them of the desertion of his wife, what she had said at
going away, and of his resolves to travel to the islands of Waak
al Waak. The seven ladies replied, "This expedition is impossible
to be accomplished either by thee or any of thy race; for these
islands are distant a hundred and fifty years' journey, so that
thou canst not live to reach them." Mazin exclaimed, "My
attempting it, however, is incumbent upon me, though I may perish
on the road: if God has decreed my reunion with my wife I shall
meet her again; but if not, I shall die and be received into the
mercy of the Almighty." The sisters did not cease to importune
him to lay aside the journey, but it was impossible for him to
obey them or remain at ease; upon which their grief for his
situation increased. They knew that the distance was such as he
could never overcome by human aid, or rejoin his wife, but they
respected his ardent love for her and his children.</p>

<p id="id04481">On this account they consulted with one another how to assist him
on the journey. He remained with them a month, but unable to
repose or enjoy their entertainments. The sisters had two uncles,
one named Abd al Kuddoos, and the other Abd al Sulleeb, who lived
at three months distance from them, to whom they wrote in
recommendation of Mazin as follows.</p>

<p id="id04482">"The bearer is our friend Mazin of Bussorah. If you can direct
him how to reach the islands of Waak al Waak, assist him; but if
not, prevent him from proceeding, lest he plunge himself into
destruction. At present he will not attend to our advice or
reproofs, from excess of love to his wife and children, but
through you there may finally occur to him safety and success."</p>

<p id="id04483">When they had sealed this letter they gave it to Mazin, and
bestowed also upon him, of water and provisions, what would
suffice for three months' consumption, laden upon camels, and a
steed for his conveyance, upon which he took leave of them with
many thanks, fully resolved to pursue his journey to the islands
of Waak al Waak.</p>

<p id="id04484">With much pain and difficulty he pursued his journey, nor had he
any pleasure either in eating or drinking during the three months
of his pilgrimage. At length he reached a verdant pasturage, in
which was a variety of flowers, flocks of sheep, and cattle
feeding. It was indeed a paradise upon earth. In one part of it
he perceived a pleasant eminence on which were buildings: he
advanced to them, and entered a court. Within it he beheld a
venerable looking personage, his beard flowing to his middle,
whom he saluted; when the sage returned his compliments, welcomed
him with respectful demeanour, and congratulated him on his
arrival. He seated him, and laid before him a collation, of which
they both ate till they were satisfied.</p>

<p id="id04485">Mazin lodged with him that night, and in the morning the sage
inquired of him his situation, and the reason of his coming to
such a sequestered spot.</p>

<p id="id04486">Mazin informed him; and, behold! this personage was Abd al
Kuddoos; who, when he heard his guest mention particulars of his
brother's children, redoubled his attentions to him, and said,
"Did they give you any letter?" Mazin replied, "Yes." He eagerly
exclaimed, "Give it to me." He gave it him, when he opened it,
read it to himself, and considered the contents word byword.</p>

<p id="id04487">Abd al Kuddoos gazed earnestly at Mazin; reflected on his
adventures, at which he was astonished; and how he had plunged
himself into danger and difficulty in such a wild pursuit. He
then said to him, "My son, my advice is, that thou return by the
way which thou hast come, and no longer vex thy soul on account
of impossibilities, for this business thou canst not accomplish.
I will write to the daughters of my brother what shall make thee
happy with them, and restore thy peace. Return then to them, and
perplex not thyself farther, for between this spot and the
islands of Waak al Waak is the distance of a hundred and fifty
years' journey. On the way also are numerous perils, for in it
are the abodes of genii, the haunts of wild beasts, and monstrous
serpents, and some parts also where food cannot be had or thirst
be gratified. Have compassion then, my son, upon thyself, and
rush not on destruction."</p>

<p id="id04488">Abd al Kuddoos continued to dissuade him from his resolution
during three days, but he would not hear advice or reproof. On
the third he prepared to depart, being sufficiently refreshed;
upon which the old man, seeing his steadiness, arose, kindled a
fire, cast into it some perfumes, and uttered incantations, to
Mazin unintelligible; when suddenly appeared a genie, in stature
forty cubits; he was one of the subdued spirits of our lord
Solomon. He muttered and growled, saying, "For what, my lord,
hast thou summoned me here? shall I tear up this eminence by the
roots, and hurl it beyond the mountains of Kaaf?"</p>

<p id="id04489">Abd al Kuddoos replied, "God be merciful to thee; I have occasion
for thee, and request that thou wilt accomplish my wish in one
day:" upon which the genie answered, "To hear is to obey."</p>

<p id="id04490">Abd al Kuddoos then said to the genie, "Take up this young man,
and convey him to my brother Abd al Sullecb." He consented,
though the distance was a common journey of seventy years. The
genie advanced, seized Mazin, and placing him upon his shoulders,
soared with him through the air from morning till sunset, when he
descended before Abd al Sulleeb, paid his respects, and informed
him of the commands of his brother Abd al Kuddoos. Upon this he
greeted Mazin, who presented him the letter from the daughters of
his brother, which he opened and read. When he had examined the
contents, he was astonished at the circumstances which had
befallen Mazin, his arrival with him, and his resolve to
penetrate to the islands of Waak al Waak. He then said to him,
"My son, I advise that thou vex not thyself with these
difficulties and dangers, for thou canst never attain thy object,
or reach these islands."</p>

<p id="id04491">Mazin now began to despair, and at the remembrance of his wife
and children to weep bitterly, insomuch that he fainted, which,
when Abd al Sulleeb beheld, his heart sympathized with his
unhappy condition. He perceived that he would not return from his
pursuit, or be controlled, and therefore thought it best to
assist his progress towards the islands. Going into another
apartment, he kindled a fire, over which he sprinkled some
perfumes, and uttered incantations; when, lo! ten genii presented
themselves before him, and said, "Inform us, my lord, what thou
desirest, and we will bring it thee in an instant." He replied,
"May God be gracious unto you!" and related to them the story of
Maxin, his wife, and children.</p>

<p id="id04492">When the ten genii had heard the narration, they exclaimed, "This
affair is wonderful and miraculous; however, we will take and
convey him safely over the mountains and deserts, to the extent
of our country and dominion, and leave him there, but cannot
promise further assistance, as we dare not pass a step beyond our
own territories, for the land belongs to others. In it are
innumerable horrors, and we dread the inhabitants." Mazin having
heard what they said, exclaimed, "I accept your offer with
gratitude."</p>

<p id="id04493">The ten genii now took up Mazin, soared with him through the air
for a night and day, till they came to the limits of their
territories, and then set him down in a country called the land
of Kafoor, took, their leaves, and vanished from his sight. He
walked onwards, and did not neglect to employ his tongue in
prayer, beseeching from God deliverance and the attainment of his
wishes. Often would he exclaim, "O God, deliverer from bondage,
who canst guide in safety over mountains, who feedest the wild
beasts of the forest, who decreest life and death, thou canst
grant me if thou choosest relief from all my distress, and free
me from all my sorrows."</p>

<p id="id04494">In this manner did he travel onwards during ten days; on the last
of which he beheld three persons contending with each other, each
man trying to kill his fellow. He was astonished at their
conduit, but advanced towards them. Upon his approach they
desisted from combat, and one and all exclaimed, "We will be
judged before his young man, and whoever contradicts his opinion
shall be deemed in the wrong." To this they agreed, and coming up
to Mazin, demanded from him a just arbitration in their dispute.
They then displayed before him a cap, a small copper drum, and a
wooden ball, saying, "We are three brothers, by the same father
and mother, who are both received into the mercy of God, leaving
behind them these articles. They are three, and we are three; but
a dispute hath fallen out among us respecting their allotment, as
each of us says, 'I will have the cap.' Our contention made us
proceed to blows, but now we are desirous that thou shouldst
arbitrate between us, and allot an article to each of us as thou
shall judge best, when we will rest satisfied with thy decision,
but should either contradict it he shall be adjuged an offender."</p>

<p id="id04495">When Mazin heard the above he was surprised, and said to himself,
"These articles are so paltry and of such trifling value as not
to be worth an arbitration; for surely this shabby cap, the drum,
and the wooden ball, cannot be worth altogether more than half a
deenar; but I will inquire farther about them." He then said, "My
brethren, wherein lies the value of these three things about
which you were contending, for to me they appear of very little
worth." They replied, "Dear uncle, each of them has a property
worth treasuries of wealth, and to each of them belongs a tale so
wonderful, that wert thou to write it on a tablet of adamant it
would remain an example for those who will be admonished."</p>

<p id="id04496">Mazin then requested that they would relate to him the stories of
the three articles, when they said, "The eldest brother shall
first deliver the account of one, its properties, what can be
gained from them, and we will not conceal any thing from thee."</p>

<p id="id04497">"This cap," said the elder brother, "is called the cap of
invisibility, by which, whoever possesseth it may become
sovereign of the world. When he puts it on, he may enter where he
pleases, for none can perceive him, either genii or men, so that
he may convey away whatever he chooses, unseen, in security. He
may enter the cabinets of kings and statesmen, and hear all they
converse upon respecting political intrigues. Does he covet
wealth, he may visit the royal treasuries, and plunder them at
his pleasure; or does he wish for revenge, he can kill his enemy
without being detected. In short, he may act as he pleases
without fear of discovery."</p>

<p id="id04498">Mazin now said to himself, "This cap can become nobody but me, to
whom it will be most advantageous in the object of my expedition.
Perhaps it may conduct me to my wife and children, and I may
obtain from its possession all I wish. It is certainly one of the
wonders of the world and rarities of the age, not to be found
among the riches of kings of the present day." When he had
ruminated thus, he said, "I am acquainted with the properties of
the cap, what are those of the drum?"</p>

<p id="id04499">The second brother began, saying, "Whoever has this drum in his
possession, should he be involved in a difficult situation, let
him take it out of its case, and with the sticks gently beat upon
the characters engraven on the copper; when, if his mind be
collected and his courage firm, there will appear to him
wonderful matters. The virtue of it consists in the words
inscribed upon it, which were written by our lord Solomon Bin
David in talismanic characters, each of which has control over
certain spirits and princes of the genii, and a power that cannot
be described in speech. Hence, whoever is master of this drum may
become superior to all the monarchs of the present day, for, on
his beating it in the manner already described, when he is
pressed for help, all the princes of the genii, with their sons,
will appear also their troops and followers, ready to obey his
commands. Whatever he may order them to execute they will perform
by virtue of the talisman of our lord Solomon Bin David."</p>

<p id="id04500">When Mazin of Bussorah had heard the above, he said to himself,
"This drum is fitting only for me, as I have much more need of it
than the brothers. It will protect me from all evil in the
islands of Waak al Waak, should I reach them, and meet with my
wife and children. It is true, if I take only the cap I may be
able to enter all places, but this drum will keep injury from me,
and with it I shall be secure from all enemies." After this, he
said, "I have been informed of the virtues of the cap, and the
properties of the drum, there now only remains the account of the
wooden ball, that I may give judgment between you, therefore let
the third brother speak." He answered, "To hear is to obey."</p>

<p id="id04501">The third brother said, "My dear uncle, whoever possesses this
ball will find in it wonderful properties, for it brings distant
parts near, and makes near distant, it shortens long journeys, and
lengthens short ones If any person wish to perform one of two
hundred years in two days, let him take it from its case, then
lay it upon the ground and mention what place he desires to go,
it will instantly be in motion, and rush over the earth like the
blast of the stormy gale. He must then follow it till he arrives
at the place desired, which he will have the power to do with
ease."</p>

<p id="id04502">When the youth had concluded his description of the virtue of the
wooden ball, Mazin resolved within himself to take this also from
the brothers, and said, "If your wish be that I should arbitrate
between you, I must first prove the virtues of these three
articles, and afterwards let each take that which may fall to him
by decision." The three brothers exclaimed, "We have heard, and
we consent; act as thou thinkest best, and may God protect thee
in thy undertakings!" Mazin then put on the cap, placed the drum
under his vestband, took up the ball and placed it on the ground,
when it speeded before him swiftly as the gale. He followed it
till it came to the gate of a building which it entered, and
Mazin also went in with it. The brothers ran till they were
fatigued, and cried out, "Thou hast sufficiently tried them;" but
in vain, for by this time there was between him and them the
distance of ten years' journey. Mazin now rested, took the drum
in his hands, rubbed his fingers over the talismanic characters,
hesitated whether he should strike them with the sticks, then
labored lightly upon them, when, lo! a voice exclaimed, "Mazin,
thou hast gained thy desires.</p>

<p id="id04503">"Thou wilt not, however," continued the voice, "arrive at thy
object till after much trouble, but take care of the ball in this
spot, for thou art at present in the land of the evil genii."
Upon this, Mazin took up the ball and concealed it in his
clothes; but he was overcome with astonishment at hearing words
without seeing the speaker, and exclaimed, "Who art thou, my
lord?" "I am," replied the voice, "one of the slaves of the
characters which thou seest engraved upon the drum, and
unremittingly in attendance; but the other servants will not
appear except the drum be beaten loudly, when three hundred and
sixty chiefs will attend thy commands, each of whom has under his
authority ten thousand genii, and every individual of them
numerous followers."</p>

<p id="id04504">Mazin now inquired the distance of the islands of Waak al Waak;
to which the voice replied, "Three years' journey:" upon which he
struck the ball before him, and followed it. He next arrived in a
region infested by serpents, dragons, and ravenous beasts, in the
mountains of which were mines of copper. He now again tabored
gently upon the drum, when the voice exclaimed, "I am ready to
obey thy commands."</p>

<p id="id04505">"Inform me," said Mazin, "what is the name of this country?" "It
is called," answered the voice, "the Land of Dragons and Ravenous
Animals. Be careful then of thyself, and make no delay, nor
regard fatigue, for these mountains are not to be passed without
a chance of trouble from the inhabitants, who are genii, and in
their caves are furious wild beasts." Upon this he struck the
ball afresh, and followed it unceasingly, till at length he
reached the sea shore, and perceived the islands of Waak al Waak
at a distance, whose mountains appeared of a fiery red, like the
sky gilded by the beams of the setting sun. When he beheld them
he was struck with awe and dread; but recovering, he said to
himself, "Why should I be afraid? since God has conducted me
hither, he will protect me; or, if I die, I shall be relieved
from my troubles, and be received into the mercy of God." He then
gathered some fruits, which he ate, drank some water, and having
performed his devotions, laid himself down to sleep, nor did he
awake till the morning.</p>

<p id="id04506">In the morning Mazin had recourse to his drum, which he rubbed
gently, when the voice inquired his commands. "How am I," said
he, "to pass this sea, and enter the islands?" "That is not to be
done," replied the voice, "without the assistance of a sage who
resides in a cell on yonder mountains, distant from hence a day's
journey, but the ball will conduct thee there in half an hour.
When you reach his abode, knock softly at the door, when he will
appear, and inquire whence you come, and what you want. On
entering he will receive thee kindly, and desire thee to relate
thy adventures from beginning to end. Conceal nothing from him,
for he alone can assist thee in passing the sea."</p>

<p id="id04507">Mazin then struck the ball, and followed it till he arrived at
the abode of the hermit, the gate of which he found locked He
knocked, when a voice from within said, "Who is at the gate?" "A
guest," replied Mazin upon which the sage arose and opened the
door, admitted him, and entertained him kindly for a whole night
and day, after which Mazin ventured to inquire how he might pass
the sea The sage replied, "What occasions thy searching after
such an object?" Mazin answered, "My lord, I intend to enter the
islands, and with that view have I travelled far distant from my
own country." When the sage heard this, he stood up before him,
took a book, opened it, and read in it to himself for some time,
every now and then casting a look of astonishment upon Mazin. At
length he raised his head and said, "Heavens! what troubles,
disasters, and afflictions in exile have been decreed to this
youth in the search of his object!" Upon this Mazin exclaimed,
"Wherefore, my lord, did you look at the book and then at me so
earnestly?" The sage replied, "My son, I would instruct thee how
to reach the islands, since such is thy desire, but thou canst
not succeed in thy desires till after much labour and
inconvenience. However, at present relate to me thy adventures
from first to last" Mazin rejoined, "My story, my lord, is such a
surprising one, that were it engraven on tablets of adamant, it
would be an example for such as would take warning."</p>

<p id="id04508">When he had related his story from beginning to end, the sage
exclaimed, "God willing thou wilt attain thy wishes:" upon which
Mazin inquired concerning the sea surrounding the islands, and
how he could overcome such an impediment to his progress; when
the sage answered, "By God's permission, in the morning we will
repair to the mountains, and I will shew thee the wonders of the
seas."</p>

<p id="id04509">When God permitted morning to dawn the hermit arose, took Mazin
with him, and they ascended the mountains, till they reached a
structure resembling a fortress, which they entered, and
proceeded into the inmost court, in which was an immense colossal
statue of brass, hollowed into pipes, having in the midst of it a
reservoir lined with marble, the work of magicians. When Mazin
beheld this he was astonished, and began to tremble with fear at
the vastness of the statue, and what miraculous power it might
contain. The hermit now kindled a fire, threw into it some
perfumes, and muttered some unintelligible words, when suddenly
dark clouds arose, from which burst out eddies of tempestuous
wind, lightnings, claps of thunder, groans, and frightful noises,
and in the midst of the reservoir appeared boiling waves, for it
was near the ocean surrounding the islands. The hermit did not
cease to utter his incantations, until the hurricane and noises
had subsided by his authority, for he was more powerful than any
of the magicians, and had command over the rebellious genii. He
now said to Mazin, "Go out, and look towards the ocean
surrounding the islands."</p>

<p id="id04510">Mazin repaired to the summit of the mountain, and looked towards
the sea, but could not discover the smallest trace of its
existence: upon which he was astonished at the miraculous power
of the hermit. He returned to him, exclaiming, "I can behold no
remains of the ocean, and the islands appear joined to the main
land;" when the sage said, "My son, place thy reliance on God and
pursue thy object," after which he vanished from sight.</p>
