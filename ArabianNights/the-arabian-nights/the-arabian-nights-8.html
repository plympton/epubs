<h2 id="id02824" style="margin-top: 4em">               THE STORY OF ALLA AD DEEN; OR, THE
                        WONDERFUL LAMP.</h2>

<p id="id02825" style="margin-top: 3em">In the capital of one of the large and rich provinces of the
kingdom of China, the name of which I do not recollect, there
lived a tailor, named Mustapha, who was so poor, that he could
hardly, by his daily labour, maintain himself and his family,
which consisted of a wife and son.</p>

<p id="id02826">His son, who was called Alla ad Deen, had been brought up in a
very careless and idle manner, and by that means had contracted
many vicious habits. He was wicked, obstinate, and disobedient to
his father and mother, who, when he grew up, could not keep him
within doors. He was in the habit of going out early in the
morning, and would stay out all day, playing in the streets and
public places with idle children of his own age.</p>

<p id="id02827">When he was old enough to learn a trade, his father not being
able to put him out to any other, took him into his own shop, and
taught him how to use his needle: but neither fair words nor the
fear of chastisement were capable of fixing his lively genius.
All his father's endeavours to keep him to his work were in vain;
for no sooner was his back turned, than he was gone for that day.
Mustapha chastised him, but Alla ad Deen was incorrigible, and
his father, to his great grief, was forced to abandon him to his
idleness: and was so much troubled at not being able to reclaim
him, that it threw him into a fit of sickness, of which he died
in a few months.</p>

<p id="id02828">The mother, finding that her son would not follow his father's
business, shut up the shop, sold off the implements of trade, and
with the money she received for them, and what she could get by
spinning cotton, thought to maintain herself and her son. Alla ad
Deen, who was now no longer restrained by the fear of a father,
and who cared so little for his mother, that whenever she chid
him, he would abuse her, gave himself entirely over to his idle
habits, and was never out of the streets from his companions.
This course he followed till he was fifteen years old, without
giving his mind to any useful pursuit, or the least reflection on
what would become of him. In this situation, as he was one day
playing according to custom in the street, with his vagabond
associates, a stranger passing by stood to observe him.</p>

<p id="id02829">This stranger was a sorcerer, called by the writer of this story,
the African magician; he was a native of Africa, and had been but
two days arrived from thence.</p>

<p id="id02830">The African magician, who was a good physiognomist, observing in
Alla ad Deen's countenance something absolutely necessary for the
execution of the design he was engaged in, inquired artfully
about his family, who he was, and what were his inclinations; and
when he had learned all he desired to know, went up to him, and
taking him aside from his comrades, said, "Child, was not your
father called Mustapha the tailor?" "Yes, sir," answered the boy;
"but he has been dead a long time."</p>

<p id="id02831">At these words, the African magician threw his arms about Alla ad
Deen's neck, and kissed him several times with tears in his eyes.
Alla ad Deen, who observed his tears, asked him what made him
weep. "Alas! my son," cried the African magician with a sigh,
"how can I forbear?</p>

<p id="id02832">"I am your uncle; your worthy father was my own brother. I have
been many years abroad, and now I am come home with the hopes of
seeing him, you tell me he is dead. I assure you it is a sensible
grief to me to be deprived of the comfort I expected. But it is
some relief to my affliction, that as far as I can remember him,
I knew you at first sight, you are so like him; and I see I am
not deceived." Then he asked Alla ad Deen, putting his hand into
his purse, where his mother lived; and as soon as he had informed
him, gave him a handful of small money, saying, "Go, my son, to
your mother, give my love to her, and tell her that I will visit
her to-morrow, if I have time, that I may have the satisfaction
of seeing where my good brother lived so long, and ended his
days."</p>

<p id="id02833">As soon as the African magician left his newly-adopted nephew, Alla ad
Deen ran to his mother, overjoyed at the money his uncle had given
him. "Mother," said he, "have I an uncle?" "No, child," replied his
mother, "you have no uncle by your father's side, or mine." "I am just
now come," said Alla ad Deen, "from a man who says he is my uncle by
my father's side, assuring me that he is his brother. He cried and
kissed me when I told him my father was dead; and to shew you that
what I tell you is truth," added he, pulling out the money, "see what
he has given me. He charged me to give his love to you, and to tell
you, if he has any time to-morrow, he will come and pay you a visit,
that he may see the house my father lived and died in." "Indeed,
child," replied the mother, "your father had a brother, but he has
been dead a long time, and I never heard of another."</p>

<p id="id02834">The mother and son talked no more then of the African magician;
but the next day Alla ad Deen's uncle found him playing in
another part of the town with other children, and embracing him
as before, put two pieces of gold into his hand, and said to him,
"Carry this, child, to your mother, tell her that I will come and
see her tonight, and bid her get us something for supper; but
first shew me the house where you live."</p>

<p id="id02835">After Alla ad Deen had shewed the African magician the house, he
carried the two pieces of gold to his mother, and when he had
told her of his uncle's intention, she went out and bought
provisions; and considering she wanted various utensils, borrowed
them of her neighbours. She spent the whole day in preparing the
supper; and at night when it was ready, said to her son, "Perhaps
your uncle knows not how to find our house; go and bring him if
you meet with him."</p>

<p id="id02836">Though Alla ad Deen had shewed the magician the house, he was
ready to go, when somebody knocked at the door, which he
immediately opened: and the magician came in loaded with wine,
and all sorts of fruits, which he brought for a dessert.</p>

<p id="id02837">After the African magician had given what he brought into Alla ad
Deen's hands, he saluted his mother, and desired her to shew him
the place where his brother Mustapha used to sit on the sofa; and
when she had so done, he fell down and kissed it several times,
crying out with tears in his eyes, "My poor brother! How unhappy
am I, not to have come soon enough to give you one last embrace."
Alla ad Deen's mother desired him to sit down in the same place,
but he declined. "No," said he, "I shall take care how I do that;
but give me leave to sit opposite to it, that although I am
deprived of the satisfaction of seeing the master of a family so
dear to me, I may at least have the pleasure of beholding the
place where he used to sit." The widow pressed him no farther,
but left him at liberty to sit where he pleased.</p>

<p id="id02838">When the magician had made choice of a place, and sat down, he
began to enter into discourse with Alla ad Deen's mother. "My
good sister," said he, "do not be surprised at your never having
seen me all the time you have been married to my brother Mustapha
of happy memory. I have been forty years absent from this
country, which is my native place, as well as my late brother's;
and during that time have travelled into the Indies, Persia,
Arabia, Syria, and Egypt, have resided in the finest towns of
those countries; and afterwards crossed over into Africa, where I
made a longer stay. At last, as it is natural for a man, how
distant soever it may be, to remember his native country,
relations, and acquaintance, I was desirous to see mine again,
and to embrace my dear brother; and finding I had strength enough
to undertake so long a journey, I immediately made the necessary
preparations, and set out. I will not tell you the length of time
it took me, all the obstacles I met with, and what fatigues I
have endured, to come hither; but nothing ever mortified and
afflicted me so much, as hearing of my brother's death, for whom
I always had a brotherly love and friendship. I observed his
features in the face of my nephew, your son, and distinguished
him among a number of children with whom he was at play; he can
tell you how I received the most melancholy news that ever
reached my ears. But God be praised for all things! It is a
comfort for me to find, as it were, my brother in a son, who has
his most remarkable features."</p>

<p id="id02839">The African magician perceiving that the widow began to weep at
the remembrance of her husband, changed the conversation, and
turning towards her son, asked him his name. "I am called Alla ad
Deen," said he. "Well, Alla ad Deen," replied the magician, "what
business do you follow? Are you of any trade?"</p>

<p id="id02840">At this question the youth hung down his head, and was not a
little abashed when his mother answered, "Alla ad Deen is an idle
fellow; his father, when alive, strove all he could to teach him
his trade, but could not succeed; and since his death,
notwithstanding all I can say to him, he does nothing but idle
away his time in the streets, as you saw him, without considering
he is no longer a child; and if you do not make him ashamed of
it, I despair of his ever coming to any good. He knows that his
father left him no fortune, and sees me endeavour to get bread by
spinning cotton; for my part, I am resolved one of these days to
turn him out of doors, and let him provide for himself."</p>

<p id="id02841">After these words, Alla ad Deen's mother burst into tears; and
the magician said, "This is not well, nephew; you must think of
helping yourself, and getting your livelihood. There are many
sorts of trades, consider if you have not an inclination to some
of them; perhaps you did not like your father's, and would prefer
another: come, do not disguise your sentiments from me; I will
endeavour to help you." But finding that Alla ad Deen returned no
answer, "If you have no mind," continued he, "to learn any
handicraft, I will take a shop for you, furnish it with all sorts
of fine stuffs and linens; and with the money you make of them
lay in fresh goods, and then you will live in an honourable way.
Consult your inclination, and tell me freely what you think of my
proposal: you shall always find me ready to keep my word."</p>

<p id="id02842">This plan greatly flattered Alla ad Deen, who hated work, but had
sense enough to know that such shops were much frequented, and
the owners respected. He told the magician he had a greater
inclination to that business than to any other, and that he
should be much obliged to him for his kindness. "Since this
profession is agreeable to you," said the African magician, "I
will carry you with me to-morrow, clothe you as handsomely as the
best merchants in the city, and afterwards we will think of
opening a shop as I mentioned."</p>

<p id="id02843">The widow, who never till then could believe that the magician
was her husband's brother, no longer doubted after his promises
of kindness to her son. She thanked him for his good intentions;
and after having exhorted Alla ad Deen to render himself worthy
of his uncle's favour by good behaviour, served up supper, at
which they talked of several indifferent matters; and then the
magician, who saw that the night was pretty far advanced, took
his leave, and retired.</p>

<p id="id02844">He came again the next day, as he had promised, and took Alla ad
Deen with him to a merchant, who sold all sorts of clothes for
different ages and ranks ready made, and a variety of fine
stuffs. He asked to see some that suited Alla ad Deen in size;
and after choosing a suit for himself which he liked best, and
rejecting others which he did not think handsome enough, he bade
Alla ad Deen choose those he preferred. Alla ad Deen, charmed
with the liberality of his new uncle, made choice of one, and the
magician immediately paid for it.</p>

<p id="id02845">When Alla ad Deen found himself so handsomely equipped, he
returned his uncle thanks; who promised never to forsake him, but
always to take him along with him; which he did to the most
frequented places in the city, and particularly where the
principal merchants kept their shops.</p>

<p id="id02846">When he brought him into the street where they sold the richest
stuffs, and finest linens, he said to Alla ad Deen, "As you are
soon to be a merchant, it is proper you should frequent these
shops, and be acquainted with them." He then shewed him the
largest and finest mosques, carried him to the khans or inns
where the merchants and travellers lodged, and afterwards to the
sultan's palace, where he had free access; and at last brought
him to his own khan, where meeting with some merchants he had
become acquainted with since his arrival, he gave them a treat,
to bring them and his pretended nephew acquainted.</p>

<p id="id02847">This entertainment lasted till night, when Alla ad Deen would
have taken leave of his uncle to go home; the magician would not
let him go by himself, but conducted him to his mother, who, as
soon as she saw him so well dressed, was transported with joy,
and bestowed a thousand blessings upon the magician, for being at
so great an expense upon her child. "Generous relation!" said
she, "I know not how to thank you for your liberality! I know
that my son is not deserving of your favours; and were he ever so
grateful, and answered your good intentions, he would be unworthy
of them. I thank you with all my soul, and wish you may live long
enough to witness my son's gratitude, which he cannot better shew
than by regulating his conduct by your good advice." "Alla ad
Deen," replied the magician, "is a good boy, and I believe we
shall do very well; but I am sorry for one thing, which is, that
I cannot perform to-morrow what I promised, because, as it is
Friday, the shops will be shut up, and therefore we cannot hire
or furnish one, but must wait till Saturday. I will, however,
call on him to-morrow and take him to walk in the gardens, where
people of the best fashion generally resort. Perhaps he has never
seen these amusements, he has only hitherto been among children;
but now he must see men." The African magician took his leave of
the mother and the son, and retired. Alla ad Deen, who was
overjoyed to be so well clothed, anticipated the pleasure of
walking in the gardens. He had never been out of the town, nor
seen the environs, which were very beautiful and pleasant.</p>

<p id="id02848">Alla ad Deen rose early the next morning, dressed himself, to be
ready when his uncle called on him; and after he had waited some
time, began to be impatient, and stood watching at the door; but
as soon as he perceived him coming, he told his mother, took his
leave of her, and ran to meet him.</p>

<p id="id02849">The magician caressed Alla ad Deen, and said, "Come, my dear
child, and I will shew you fine things." He then led him out at
one of the gates of the city, to some magnificent houses, or
rather palaces, to each of which belonged beautiful gardens, into
which anybody might enter. At every building he came to, he asked
Alla ad Deen if he did not think it fine; and the youth was ready
to answer when any one presented itself, crying out, "Here is a
finer house, uncle, than any we have seen yet." By this artifice,
the cunning magician led Alla ad Deen some way into the country;
and as he meant to carry him farther, to execute his design, he
took an opportunity to sit down in one of the gardens on the
brink of a fountain of clear water, which discharged itself by a
lion's mouth of bronze into a basin, pretending to be tired.
"Come, nephew," said he, "you must be weary as well as I; let us
rest ourselves, and we shall be better able to pursue our walk."</p>

<p id="id02850">After they had sat down, the magician pulled from his girdle a
handkerchief with cakes and fruit, which he had provided, and
laid them on the edge of the basin. He broke a cake in two, gave
one half to Alla ad Deen, and ate the other himself; and in
regard to the fruit, left him at liberty to take which sort he
liked best. During this short repast, he exhorted his nephew to
leave off keeping company with vagabonds, and seek that of wise
and prudent men, to improve by their conversation. "For," said
he, "you will soon be at man's estate, and you cannot too early
begin to imitate their example." When they had eaten as much as
they liked, they got up, and pursued their walk through gardens
separated from one another only by small ditches, which marked
out the limits without interrupting the communication; so great
was the confidence the inhabitants reposed in each other. By this
means, the African magician drew Alla ad Deen insensibly beyond
the gardens, and crossed the country, till they nearly reached
the mountains.</p>

<p id="id02851">Alla ad Deen, who had never been so far before, began to find
himself much tired with so long a walk, and said to the magician,
"Where are we going, uncle? We have left the gardens a great way
behind us, and I see nothing but mountains; if we go much
further, I do not know whether I shall be able to reach the town
again?" "Never fear, nephew," said the false uncle; "I will shew
you another garden which surpasses all we have yet seen; it is
not far off; and when we come there, you will say that you would
have been sorry to have been so nigh, and not seen it." Alla ad
Deen was soon persuaded; and the magician, to make the way seem
shorter and less fatiguing, told him a great many stories.</p>

<p id="id02852">At last they arrived between two mountains of moderate height,
and equal size, divided by a narrow valley, which was the place
where the magician intended to execute the design that had
brought him from Africa to China. "We will go no farther now,"
said he to Alla ad Deen: "I will shew you here some extraordinary
things, which, when you have seen, you will thank me for: but
while I strike a light, gather up all the loose dry sticks you
can see, to kindle a fire with."</p>

<p id="id02853">Alla ad Deen found so many dried sticks, that before the magician
had made a light, he had collected a great heap. The magician
presently set them on fire, and when they were in a blaze, threw
in some incense which raised a cloud of smoke. This he dispersed
on each side, by pronouncing several magical words which Alla ad
Deen did not understand.</p>

<p id="id02854">At the same time the earth trembling, opened just before the
magician, and uncovered a stone, laid horizontally, with a brass
ring fixed into the middle. Alla ad Deen was so frightened at
what he saw, that he would have run away; but the magician caught
hold of him, abused him, and gave him such a box on the ear, that
he knocked him down. Alla ad Deen got up trembling, and with
tears in his eyes, said to the magician, "What have I done,
uncle, to be treated in this severe manner?" "I have my reasons,"
answered the magician: "I am your uncle, I supply the place of
your father, and you ought to make no reply. But, child," added
he, softening, "do not be afraid; for I shall not ask any thing
of you, but that you obey me punctually, if you would reap the
advantages which I intend you." These fair promises calmed Alla
ad Deen's fears and resentment; and when the magician saw that he
was appeased, he said to him, "You see what I have done by virtue
of my incense, and the words I pronounced. Know then, that under
this stone there is hidden a treasure, destined to be yours, and
which will make you richer than the greatest monarch in the
world: no person but yourself is permitted to lift this stone, or
enter the cave; so you must punctually execute what I may
command, for it is a matter of great consequence both to you and
me."</p>

<p id="id02855">Alla ad Deen, amazed at all he saw and heard the magician say of
the treasure which was to make him happy, forgot what was past,
and rising, said, "Well, uncle, what is to be done? Command me, I
am ready to obey." "I am overjoyed, child," said the African
magician, embracing him; "take hold of the ring, and lift up that
stone." "Indeed, uncle," replied Alla ad Deen, "I am not strong
enough, you must help me." "You have no occasion for my
assistance," answered the magician; "if I help you, we shall be
able to do nothing; take hold of the ring, pronounce the names of
your father and grandfather, then lift it up, and you will find
it will come easily." Alla ad Deen did as the magician bade him,
raised the stone with ease, and laid it on one side.</p>

<p id="id02856">When the stone was pulled up, there appeared a cavity of about
three or four feet deep, with a little door, and steps to go down
lower. "Observe, my son," said the African magician, "what I
direct. Descend into the cave, and when you are at the bottom of
those steps you will find a door open, which will lead you into a
spacious vault, divided into three great halls, in each of which
you will see four large brass cisterns placed on each side, full
of gold and silver; but take care you do not meddle with them.
Before you enter the first hall, be sure to tuck up your vest,
wrap it about you, and then pass through the second into the
third without stopping. Above all things, have a care that you do
not touch the walls, so much as with your clothes; for if you do,
you will die instantly. At the end of the third hall, you will
find a door which opens into a garden planted with fine trees
loaded with fruit; walk directly across the garden by a path
which will lead you to five steps that will bring you upon a
terrace, where you will see a niche before you, and in that niche
a lighted lamp. Take the lamp down, and extinguish it: when you
have thrown away the wick, and poured out the liquor, put it in
your vestband and bring it to me. Do not be afraid that the
liquor will spoil your clothes, for it is not oil; and the lamp
will be dry as soon as it is thrown out. If you should wish for
any of the fruit of the garden, you may gather as much as you
please."</p>

<p id="id02857">After these words, the magician drew a ring off his finger, and
put it on one of Alla ad Deen's, telling him that it was a
preservative against all evil, while he should observe what he
had prescribed to him. After this instruction he said, "Go down
boldly, child, and we shall both be rich all our lives."</p>

<p id="id02858">Alla ad Deen jumped into the cave, descended the steps, and found
the three halls just as the African magician had described. He
went through them with all the precaution the fear of death could
inspire; crossed the garden without stopping, took down the lamp
from the niche, threw out the wick and the liquor, and, as the
magician had desired, put it in his vestband. But as he came down
from the terrace, seeing it was perfectly dry, he stopped in the
garden to observe the fruit, which he only had a glimpse of in
crossing it. All the trees were loaded with extraordinary fruit,
of different colours on each tree. Some bore fruit entirely
white, and some clear and transparent as crystal; some pale red,
and others deeper; some green, blue, and purple, and others
yellow: in short, there was fruit of all colours. The white were
pearls; the clear and transparent, diamonds; the deep red,
rubies; the paler, rubies; the green, emeralds; the blue,
turquoises; the purple, amethysts; and those that were of yellow
cast, sapphires. Alla ad Deen was altogether ignorant of their
worth, and would have preferred figs and grapes, or any other
fruits. But though he took them only for coloured glass of little
value, yet he was so pleased with the variety of the colours, and
the beauty and extraordinary size of the seeming fruit, that he
resolved to gather some of every sort; and accordingly filled the
two new purses his uncle had bought for him with his clothes.
Some he wrapped up in the skirts of his vest, which was of silk,
large and wrapping, and crammed his bosom as full as it could
hold.</p>

<p id="id02859">Alla ad Deen, having thus loaded himself with riches he knew not
the value of, returned through the three halls with the same
precaution, made all the haste he could, that he might not make
his uncle wait, and soon arrived at the mouth of the cave, where
the African magician expected him with the utmost impatience. As
soon as Alla ad Deen saw him, he cried out, "Pray, uncle, lend me
your hand, to help me out." "Give me the lamp first," replied the
magician; "it will be troublesome to you." "Indeed, uncle,"
answered Alla ad Deen, "I cannot now; it is not troublesome to
me: but I will as soon as I am up." The African magician was so
obstinate, that he would have the lamp before he would help him
up; and Alla ad Deen, who had encumbered himself so much with his
fruit that he could not well get at it, refused to give it to him
till he was out of the cave. The African magician, provoked at
this obstinate refusal, flew into a passion, threw a little of
his incense into the fire, which he had taken care to keep in,
and no sooner pronounced two magical words, than the stone which
had closed the mouth of the cave moved into its place, with the
earth over it in the same manner as it lay at the arrival of the
magician and Alla ad Deen.</p>

<p id="id02860">This action of the African magician's plainly shewed him to be
neither Alla ad Deen's uncle, nor Mustapha the tailor's brother;
but a true African. Africa is a country whose inhabitants delight
most in magic of any in the whole world, and he had applied
himself to it from his youth. After forty years' experience in
enchantments, geomancy, fumigations, and reading of magic books,
he had found out that there was in the world a wonderful lamp,
the possession of which would render him more powerful than any
monarch; and by a late operation of geomancy, he had discovered
that this lamp lay concealed in a subterraneous place in the
midst of China, in the situation already described. Fully
persuaded of the truth of this discovery, he set out from the
farthest part of Africa; and after a long and fatiguing journey,
came to the town nearest to this treasure. But though he had a
certain knowledge of the place where the lamp was, he was not
permitted to take it himself, nor to enter the subterraneous
place, but must receive it from the hands of another person. For
this reason he had addressed himself to Alla ad Deen, whom he
looked upon as a young lad whose life was of no consequence, and
fit to serve his purpose, resolving, as soon as he should get the
lamp into his hands, to sacrifice him to his avarice and
wickedness, by making the fumigation mentioned before, and
repeating two magical words, the effect of which would remove the
stone into its place, so that no witness would remain of the
transaction.</p>

<p id="id02861">The blow he had given Alla ad Deen was intended to make him obey
the more readily, and give him the lamp as soon as he should ask
for it. But his too great precipitation, and his fear lest
somebody should come that way during their dispute, and discover
what he wished to keep secret, produced an effect quite contrary
to what he had proposed to himself.</p>

<p id="id02862">When the African magician saw that all his hopes were frustrated
forever, he returned the same day for Africa; but went quite
round the town, and at some distance from it, lest some persons
who had observed him walk out with the boy, on seeing him come
back without him, should entertain any suspicions, and stop him.</p>

<p id="id02863">According to all appearances, there was no prospects of Alla ad
Deen being any more heard of. But the magician, when he had
contrived his death, forgot the ring he had put upon his finger,
which preserved him, though he knew not its virtue. It may seem
astonishing that the loss of that, together with the lamp, did
not drive the magician to despair; but magicians are so much used
to misfortunes, and events contrary to their wishes, that they do
not lay them to heart, but still feed themselves, to the end of
life, with unsubstantial notions and chimeras.</p>

<p id="id02864">The surprise of Alla ad Deen, who had never suspected this
treachery from his pretended uncle, after all his caresses and
what he had done for him, is more easily to be imagined than
expressed. When he found himself buried alive, he cried, and
called out to his uncle, to tell him he was ready to give him the
lamp; but in vain, since his cries could not be heard. He
descended to the bottom of the steps, with a design to get into
the garden, but the door, which was opened before by enchantment,
was now shut by the same means. He then redoubled his cries and
tears, sat down on the steps, without any hopes of ever seeing
light again, and in a melancholy certainty of passing from the
present darkness into that of a speedy death.</p>

<p id="id02865">Alla ad Deen remained in this state two days, without eating or
drinking, and on the third looked upon death as inevitable.
Clasping his hands with an entire resignation to the will of God,
he said, "There is no strength or power but in the great and high
God." In this action of joining his hands he rubbed the ring
which the magician had put on his finger, and of which he knew
not yet the virtue. Immediately a genie of enormous size and
frightful aspect rose out of the earth, his head reaching the
roof of the vault, and said to him, "What wouldst thou have? I am
ready to obey thee as thy slave, and the slave of all who may
possess the ring on thy finger; I, and the other slaves of that
ring."</p>

<p id="id02866">At another time, Alla ad Deen, who had not been used to such
appearances, would have been so frightened at the sight of so
extraordinary a figure that he would not have been able to speak;
but the danger he was in made him answer without hesitation,
"Whoever thou art, deliver me from this place, if thou art able."
He had no sooner spoken these words, than he found himself on the
very spot where the magician had caused the earth to open.</p>

<p id="id02867">It was some time before his eyes could bear the light, after
being so long in total darkness: but after he had endeavoured by
degrees to support it, and began to look about him, he was much
surprised not to find the earth open, and could not comprehend
how he had got so soon out of its bowels. There was nothing to be
seen but the place where the fire had been, by which he could
nearly judge the situation of the cave. Then turning himself
towards the town, he perceived it at a distance in the midst of
the gardens that surrounded it, and saw the way by which the
magician had brought him. Returning God thanks to find himself
once more in the world, he made the best of his way home. When he
got within his mother's door, the joy to see her and his weakness
for want of sustenance for three days made him faint, and he
remained for a long time as dead. His mother, who had given him
over for lost, seeing him in this condition, omitted nothing to
bring him to himself. As soon as he recovered, the first words he
spoke, were, "Pray, mother, give me something to eat, for I have
not put a morsel of anything into my mouth these three days." His
mother brought what she had, and set it before him. "My son,"
said she, "be not too eager, for it is dangerous; eat but little
at a time, and take care of yourself. Besides, I would not have
you talk; you will have time enough to tell me what has happened
to you when you are recovered. It is a great comfort to me to see
you again, after the affliction I have been in since Friday, and
the pains I have taken to learn what was become of you."</p>

<p id="id02868">Alla ad Deen took his mother's advice, and ate and drank
moderately. When he had done, "Mother," said he to her, "I cannot
help complaining of you, for abandoning me so easily to the
discretion of a man who had a design to kill me and who at this
very moment thinks my death certain. You believed he was my
uncle, as well as I; and what other thoughts could we entertain
of a man who was so kind to me, and made such advantageous
proffers? But I must tell you, mother, he is a rogue and a cheat,
and only made me those promises to accomplish my death; but for
what reason neither you nor I can guess. For my part, I can
assure you, I never gave him any cause to justify the least ill
treatment from him. You shall judge yourself, when you have heard
all that passed from the time I left you, till he came to the
execution of his wicked design."</p>

<p id="id02869">Alla ad Deen then related to his mother all that had happened to
him from the Friday, when the magician took him to see the
palaces and gardens about the town, and what fell out in the way,
till they came to the place between the two mountains where the
great prodigy was to be performed; how, with incense which the
magician threw into the fire, and some magical words which he
pronounced, the earth opened, and discovered a cave, which led to
an inestimable treasure. He forgot not the blow the magician had
given him, in what manner he softened again, and engaged him by
great promises, and putting a ring to his finger, to go down into
the cave. He did not omit the least circumstance of what he saw
in crossing the three halls and the garden, and his taking the
lamp, which he pulled out of his bosom and shewed to his mother,
as well as the transparent fruit of different colours, which he
had gathered in the garden as he returned. But, though these
fruits were precious stones, brilliant as the sun, and the
reflection of a lamp which then lighted the room might have led
them to think they were of great value, she was as ignorant of
their worth as her son, and cared nothing for them. She had been
bred in a low rank of life, and her husband's poverty prevented
his being possessed of jewels, nor had she, her relations, or
neighbours, ever seen any; so that we must not wonder that she
regarded them as things of no value, and only pleasing to the eye
by the variety of their colours.</p>

<p id="id02870">Alla ad Deen put them behind one of the cushions of the sofa, and
continued his story, telling his mother, that when he returned to
the mouth of the cave, upon his refusal to give the magician the
lamp till he should get out, the stone, by his throwing some
incense into the fire, and using two or three magical words, shut
him in, and the earth closed. He could not help bursting into
tears at the representation of the miserable condition he was in,
at finding himself buried alive in a dismal cave, till by the
touching of his ring, the virtue of which he was till then an
entire stranger to, he, properly speaking, came to life again.
When he had finished his story, he said to his mother, "I need
say no more, you know the rest. This is my adventure, and the
danger I have been exposed to since you saw me."</p>

<p id="id02871">Alla ad Deen's mother heard with so much patience as not to
interrupt him this surprising and wonderful relation,
notwithstanding it could be no small affliction to a mother, who
loved her son tenderly: but yet in the most moving part which
discovered the perfidy of the African magician, she could not
help shewing, by marks of the greatest indignation, how much she
detested him; and when her son had finished his story, she broke
out into a thousand reproaches against that vile impostor. She
called him perfidious traitor, barbarian, assassin, deceiver,
magician, and an enemy and destroyer of mankind. "Without doubt,
child," added she, "he is a magician, and they are plagues to the
world, and by their enchantments and sorceries have commerce with
the devil. Bless God for preserving you from his wicked designs;
for your death would have been inevitable, if you had not called
upon him, and implored his assistance." She said a great deal
more against the magician's treachery; but finding that whilst
she talked, Alla ad Deen, who had not slept for three days and
nights, began to doze, she left him to his repose and retired.</p>

<p id="id02872">Alla ad Deen, who had not closed his eyes while he was in the
subterraneous abode, slept very soundly till late the next
morning; when the first thing he said to his mother was that he
wanted something to eat, and that she could not do him a greater
kindness than to give him his breakfast. "Alas! child," said she,
"I have not a bit of bread to give you, you ate up all the
provisions I had in the house yesterday; but have a little
patience, and it shall not be long before I will bring you some:
I have a little cotton, which I have spun; I will go and sell it,
buy bread, and something for our dinner." "Mother," replied Alla
ad Deen, "keep your cotton for another time, and give me the lamp
I brought home with me yesterday; I will go and sell it, and the
money I shall get for it will serve both for breakfast and
dinner, and perhaps supper too."</p>

<p id="id02873">Alla ad Deen's mother took the lamp, and said to her son, "Here
it is, but it is very dirty; if it was a little cleaner I believe
it would bring something more." She took some fine sand and water
to clean it; but had no sooner begun to rub it, than in an
instant a hideous genie of gigantic size appeared before her, and
said to her in a voice like thunder, "What wouldst thou have? I
am ready to obey thee as thy slave, and the slave of all those
who have that lamp in their hands; I and the other slaves of the
lamp."</p>

<p id="id02874">Alla ad Deen's mother, terrified at the sight of the genie,
fainted; when Alla ad Deen, who had seen such a phantom in the
cavern, snatched the lamp out of his mother's hand, and said to
the genie boldly, "I am hungry, bring me something to eat." The
genie disappeared immediately, and in an instant returned with a
large silver tray, holding twelve covered dishes of the same
metal, which contained the most delicious viands; six large white
bread cakes on two plates, two flagons of wine, and two silver
cups. All these he placed upon a carpet, and disappeared; this
was done before Alla ad Deen's mother recovered from her swoon.</p>

<p id="id02875">Alla ad Deen had fetched some water, and sprinkled it in her
face, to recover her: whether that or the smell of the meat
brought her to life again, it was not long before she came to
herself. "Mother," said Alla ad Deen, "do not mind this; get up,
and come and eat; here is what will put you in heart, and at the
same time satisfy my extreme hunger: do not let such delicious
meat get cold."</p>

<p id="id02876">His mother was much surprised to see the great tray, twelve
dishes, six loaves, the two flagons and cups, and to smell the
savoury odour which exhaled from the dishes. "Child," said she,
"to whom are we obliged for this great plenty and liberality? Has
the sultan been made acquainted with our poverty, and had
compassion on us?" "It is no matter, mother," said Alla ad Deen,
"let us sit down and eat; for you have almost as much need of a
good breakfast as myself; when we have done, I will tell you."
Accordingly both mother and son sat down, and ate with the better
relish as the table was so well furnished. But all the time Alla
ad Deen's mother could not forbear looking at and admiring the
tray and dishes, though she could not judge whether they were
silver or any other metal, and the novelty more than the value
attracted her attention.</p>

<p id="id02877">The mother and son sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and
then they thought it would be best to put the two meals together;
yet after this they found they should have enough left for
supper, and two meals for the next day.</p>

<p id="id02878">When Alla ad Deen's mother had taken away and set by what was
left, she went and sat down by her son on the sofa, saying, "I
expect now that you should satisfy my impatience, and tell me
exactly what passed between the genie and you while I was in a
swoon;" which he readily complied with.</p>

<p id="id02879">She was in as great amazement at what her son told her, as at the
appearance of the genie; and said to him, "But, son, what have we
to do with genii? I never heard that any of my acquaintance had
ever seen one. How came that vile genie to address himself to me,
and not to you, to whom he had appeared before in the cave?"
"Mother," answered Alla ad Deen, "the genie you saw is not the
one who appeared to me, though he resembles him in size; no, they
had quite different persons and habits; they belong to different
masters. If you remember, he that I first saw, called himself the
slave of the ring on my finger; and this you saw, called himself
the slave of the lamp you had in your hand: but I believe you did
not hear him, for I think you fainted as soon as he began to
speak."</p>

<p id="id02880">"What!" cried the mother, "was your lamp then the occasion of
that cursed genie addressing himself rather to me than to you?
Ah my son, take it out of my sight, and put it where you please.
I will never touch it. I had rather you would sell it, than run
the hazard of being frightened to death again by touching it: and
if you would take my advice, you would part also with the ring,
and not have any thing to do with genii, who, as our prophet has
told us, are only devils."</p>

<p id="id02881">"With your leave, mother," replied Alla ad Deen, "I shall now
take care how I sell a lamp, which may be so serviceable both to
you and me. Have not you been an eye-witness of what it has
procured us? and it shall still continue to furnish us with
subsistence and maintenance. You may suppose as I do, that my
false and wicked uncle would not have taken so much pains, and
undertaken so long and tedious a journey, if it had not been to
get into his possession this wonderful lamp, which he preferred
before all the gold and silver which he knew was in the halls,
and which I have seen with my own eyes. He knew too well the
worth of this lamp, not to prefer it to so great a treasure; and
since chance hath discovered the virtue of it to us, let us make
a profitable use of it, without making any great shew, and
exciting the envy and jealousy of our neighbours. However, since
the genii frighten you so much, I will take it out of your sight,
and put it where I may find it when I want it. The ring I cannot
resolve to part with; for without that you had never seen me
again; and though I am alive now, perhaps, if it was gone, I
might not be so some moments hence; therefore I hope you will
give me leave to keep it, and to wear it always on my finger. Who
knows what dangers you and I may be exposed to, which neither of
us can foresee, and from which it may deliver us." As Alla ad
Deen's arguments were just, his mother had nothing to say against
them; she only replied, that he might do what he pleased, for her
part, she would have nothing to do with genii, but would wash her
hands of them, and never say anything more about them.</p>

<p id="id02882">By the next night they had eaten all the provisions the genie had
brought; and the next day Alla ad Deen, who could not bear the
thoughts of hunger, putting one of the silver dishes under his
vest, went out early to sell it, and addressing himself to a Jew
whom he met in the streets, took him aside, and pulling out the
plate, asked him if he would buy it. The cunning Jew took the
dish, examined it, and as soon as he found that it was good
silver, asked Alla ad Deen at how much he valued it. Alla ad
Deen, who knew not its value, and never had been used to such
traffic, told him he would trust to his judgment and honour. The
Jew was somewhat confounded at this plain dealing; and doubting
whether Alla ad Deen understood the material or the full value of
what he offered to sell, took a piece of gold out of his purse
and gave it him, though it was but the sixtieth part of the worth
of the plate. Alla ad Deen, taking the money very eagerly,
retired with so much haste, that the Jew, not content with the
exorbitancy of his profit, was vexed he had not penetrated into
his ignorance, and was going to run after him, to endeavour to
get some change out of the piece of gold; but he ran so fast, and
had got so far, that it would have been impossible for him to
overtake him.</p>

<p id="id02883">Before Alla ad Deen went home, he called at a baker's, bought
some cakes of bread, changed his money, and on his return gave
the rest to his mother, who went and purchased provisions enough
to last them some time. After this manner they lived, till Alla
ad Deen had sold the twelve dishes singly, as necessity pressed,
to the Jew, for the same money; who, after the first time, durst
not offer him less, for fear of losing so good a bargain. When he
had sold the last dish, he had recourse to the tray, which
weighed ten times as much as the dishes, and would have carried
it to his old purchaser, but that it was too large and
cumbersome; therefore he was obliged to bring him home with him
to his mother's, where, after the Jew had examined the weight of
the tray, he laid down ten pieces of gold, with which Alla ad
Deen was very well satisfied.</p>

<p id="id02884">They lived on these ten pieces in a frugal manner, and Alla ad
Deen, though used to an idle life, had left off playing with
young lads of his own age ever since his adventure with the
African magician. He spent his time in walking about, and
conversing with decent people, with whom he gradually got
acquainted. Sometimes he would stop at the principal merchants'
shops, where people of distinction met, and listen to their
discourse, by which he gained some little knowledge of the world.</p>

<p id="id02885">When all the money was spent, Alla ad Deen had recourse again to
the lamp. He took it in his hand, looked for the part where his
mother had rubbed it with the sand, rubbed it also, when the
genie immediately appeared, and said, "What wouldst thou have? I
am ready to obey thee as thy slave, and the slave of all those
who have that lamp in their hands; I, and the other slaves of the
lamp." "I am hungry," said Alla ad Deen, "bring me something to
eat." The genie disappeared, and presently returned with a tray,
the same number of covered dishes as before, set them down, and
vanished.</p>

<p id="id02886">Alla ad Deen's mother, knowing what her son was going to do, went
out about some business, on purpose to avoid being in the way
when the genie came; and when she returned, was almost as much
surprised as before at the prodigious effect of the lamp.
However, she sat down with her son, and when they had eaten as
much as they liked, she set enough by to last them two or three
days.</p>

<p id="id02887">As soon as Alla ad Deen found that their provisions were
expended, he took one of the dishes, and went to look for his Jew
chapman; but passing by a goldsmith's shop, who had the character
of a very fair and honest man, the goldsmith perceiving him,
called to him, and said, "My lad, I have often observed you go
by, loaded as you are at present, and talk with such a Jew, and
then come back again empty handed. I imagine that you carry
something which you sell to him; but perhaps you do not know that
he is the greatest rogue even among the Jews, and is so well
known, that nobody of prudence will have anything to do with him.
What I tell you is for your own good. If you will shew me what
you now carry, and it is to be sold, I will give you the full
worth of it; or I will direct you to other merchants who will not
cheat you."</p>

<p id="id02888">The hopes of getting more money for his plate induced Alla ad
Deen to pull it from under his vest, and shew it to the
goldsmith, who at first sight saw that it was made of the finest
silver, asked him if he had sold such as that to the Jew, when
Alla ad Deen told him that he had sold him twelve such, for a
piece of gold each. "What a villain!" cried the goldsmith; "but,"
added he, "my son, what is passed cannot be recalled. By shewing
you the value of this plate, which is of the finest silver we use
in our shops, I will let you see how much the Jew has cheated
you."</p>

<p id="id02889">The goldsmith took a pair of scales, weighed the dish, and after
he had mentioned how much an ounce of fine silver cost, assured
him that his plate would fetch by weight sixty pieces of gold,
which he offered to pay down immediately. "If you dispute my
honesty," said he, "you may go to any other of our trade, and if
he gives you more, I will be bound to forfeit twice as much; for
we gain only the fashion of the plate we buy, and that the
fairest dealing Jews are not contented with."</p>

<p id="id02890">Alla ad Deen thanked him for his fair dealing, so greatly to his
advantage, took the gold, and never after went to any other
person, but sold him all his dishes and the tray, and had as much
for them as the weight came to.</p>

<p id="id02891">Though Alla ad Deen and his mother had an inexhaustible treasure
in their lamp, and might have had whatever they wished for, yet
they lived with the same frugality as before, except that Alla ad
Deen dressed better; as for his mother, she wore no clothes but
what she earned by spinning cotton. After their manner of living,
it may easily be supposed, that the money for which Alla ad Deen
had sold the dishes and tray was sufficient to maintain them some
time.</p>

<p id="id02892">During this interval, Alla ad Deen frequented the shops of the
principal merchants, where they sold cloth of gold and silver,
linens, silk stuffs, and jewellery, and oftentimes joining in
their conversation, acquired a knowledge of the world, and
respectable demeanour. By his acquaintance among the jewellers,
he came to know that the fruits which he had gathered when he
took the lamp were, instead of coloured glass, stones of
inestimable value; but he had the prudence not to mention this to
any one, not even to his mother.</p>

<p id="id02893">One day as Alla ad Deen was walking about the town, he heard an
order proclaimed, commanding the people to shut up their shops
and houses, and keep within doors, while the princess Buddir al
Buddoor, the sultan's daughter, went to the baths and returned.</p>

<p id="id02894">This proclamation inspired Alla ad Deen with eager curiosity to
see the princess's face, which he could not do without admission
into the house of some acquaintance, and then only through a
window; which did not satisfy him, when he considered that the
princess, when she went to the baths, would be closely veiled;
but to gratify his curiosity, he presently thought of a scheme,
which succeeded; it was to place himself behind the door of the
bath, which was so situated that he could not fail of seeing her
face.</p>

<p id="id02895">Alla ad Deen had not waited long before the princess came, and he
could see her plainly through a chink of the door without being
discovered. She was attended by a great crowd of ladies, slaves
and eunuchs, who walked on each side, and behind her. When she
came within three or four paces of the door of the baths, she
took off her veil, and gave Alla ad Deen an opportunity of a full
view.</p>

<p id="id02896">As soon as Alla ad Deen had seen the princess, his heart could
not withstand those inclinations so charming an object always
inspires. The princess was the most beautiful brunette in the
world; her eyes were large, lively, and sparkling; her looks
sweet and modest; her nose was of a just proportion and without a
fault, her mouth small, her lips of a vermilion red and
charmingly agreeable symmetry; in a word, all the features of her
face were perfectly regular. It is not therefore surprising that
Alla ad Deen, who had never before seen such a blaze of charms,
was dazzled, and his senses ravished by such an assemblage. With
all these perfections the princess had so fine a form, and so
majestic an air, that the sight of her was sufficient to inspire
love and admiration.</p>

<p id="id02897">After the princess had passed by, and entered the baths, Alla ad
Deen remained some time astonished, and in a kind of ecstacy,
retracing and imprinting the idea of so charming an object deeply
in his mind. But at last, considering that the princess was gone
past him, and that when she returned from the bath her back would
be towards him, and then veiled, he resolved to quit his hiding
place and go home. He could not so far conceal his uneasiness but
that his mother perceived it, was surprised to see him so much
more thoughtful and melancholy than usual; and asked what had
happened to make him so, or if he was ill? He returned her no
answer, but sat carelessly down on the sofa, and remained silent,
musing on the image of the charming Buddir al Buddoor. His
mother, who was dressing supper, pressed him no more. When it was
ready, she served it up, and perceiving that he gave no attention
to it, urged him to eat, but had much ado to persuade him to
change his place; which when he did, he ate much less than usual,
all the time cast down his eyes, and observed so profound a
silence, that she could not obtain a word in answer to all the
questions she put, in order to find the reason of so
extraordinary an alteration.</p>

<p id="id02898">After supper, she asked him again why he was so melancholy, but
could get no information, and he determined to go to bed rather
than give her the least satisfaction. Without examining how he
passed the night, his mind full as it was with the charms of the
princess, I shall only observe that as he sat next day on the
sofa, opposite his mother, as she was spinning cotton, he spoke
to her in these words: "I perceive, mother, that my silence
yesterday has much troubled you; I was not, nor am I sick, as I
fancy you believed; but I assure you, that what I felt then, and
now endure, is worse than any disease. I cannot explain what ails
me; but doubt not what I am going to relate will inform you.</p>

<p id="id02899">"It was not proclaimed in this quarter of the town, and therefore
you could know nothing of it, that the sultan's daughter was
yesterday to go to the baths. I heard this as I walked about the
town, and an order was issued that all the shops should be shut
up in her way thither, and everybody keep within doors, to leave
the streets free for her and her attendants. As I was not then
far from the bath, I had a great curiosity to see the princess's
face; and as it occurred to me that the princess, when she came
nigh the door of the bath, would pull her veil off, I resolved to
conceal myself behind the door. You know the situation of the
door, and may imagine that I must have had a full view of her.
The princess threw off her veil, and I had the happiness of
seeing her lovely face with the greatest security. This, mother,
was the cause of my melancholy and silence yesterday; I love the
princess with more violence than I can express; and as my passion
increases every moment, I cannot live without the possession of
the amiable Buddir al Buddoor, and am resolved to ask her in
marriage of the sultan her father."</p>

<p id="id02900">Alla ad Deen's mother listened with surprise to what her son told
her; but when he talked of asking the princess in marriage, she
could not help bursting out into a loud laugh. Alla ad Deen would
have gone on with his rhapsody, but she interrupted him. "Alas!
child," said she, "what are you thinking of? you must be mad to
talk thus."</p>

<p id="id02901">"I assure you, mother," replied Alla ad Deen, "that I am not mad,
but in my right senses; I foresaw that you would reproach me with
folly and extravagance; but I must tell you once more that I am
resolved to demand the princess of the sultan in marriage, and
your remonstrances shall not prevent me."</p>

<p id="id02902">"Indeed, son," replied the mother seriously, "I cannot help
telling you that you have forgotten yourself; and if you would
put this resolution of yours in execution, I do not see whom you
can prevail upon to venture to make the proposal for you." "You
yourself," replied he immediately. "I go to the sultan!" answered
the mother, amazed and surprised. "I shall be cautious how I
engage in such an errand. Why, who are you, son," continued she,
"that you can have the assurance to think of your sultan's
daughter? Have you forgotten that your father was one of the
poorest tailors in the capital, and that I am of no better
extraction; and do not you know that sultans never marry their
daughters but to princes, sons of sovereigns like themselves?"</p>

<p id="id02903">"Mother," answered Alla ad Deen, "I have already told you that I
foresaw all that you have said, or can say: and tell you again,
that neither your discourse nor your remonstrances shall make me
change my mind. I have told you that you must ask the princess in
marriage for me: it is a favour I desire of you, and I beg of you
not to refuse, unless you would rather see me in my grave, than
by your compliance give me new life."</p>

<p id="id02904">The good old woman was much embarrassed, when she found Alla ad
Deen obstinately persisting in so wild a design. "My son," said
she again, "I am your mother, who brought you into the world, and
there is nothing that is reasonable but I would readily do for
you. If I were to go and treat about your marriage with some
neighbour's daughter, whose circumstances were equal with yours,
I would do it with all my heart; and even then they would expect
you should have some little estate or fortune, or be of some
trade. When such poor folks as we are wish to marry, the first
thing they ought to think of, is how to live. But without
reflecting on the meanness of your birth, and the little merit
and fortune you have to recommend you, you aim at the highest
pitch of exaltation; and your pretensions are no less than to
demand in marriage the daughter of your sovereign, who with one
single word can crush you to pieces. I say nothing of what
respects yourself. I leave you to reflect on what you have to do,
if you have ever so little thought. I come now to consider what
concerns myself. How could so extraordinary a thought come into
your head, as that I should go to the sultan and make a proposal
to him to give his daughter in marriage to you? Suppose I had,
not to say the boldness, but the impudence to present myself
before the sultan, and make so extravagant a request, to whom
should I address myself to be introduced to his majesty? Do you
not think the first person I should speak to would take me for a
mad woman, and chastise me as I should deserve? Suppose, however,
that there is no difficulty in presenting myself for an audience
of the sultan, and I know there is none to those who go to
petition for justice, which he distributes equally among his
subjects; I know too that to those who ask a favour he grants it
with pleasure when he sees it is deserved, and the persons are
worthy of it. But is that your case? Do you think you have
merited the honour you would have me ask for you? Are you worthy
of it? What have you done to claim such a favour, either for your
prince or country? How have you distinguished yourself? If you
have done nothing to merit so high a distinction, nor are worthy
of it, with what face shall I ask it? How can I open my mouth to
make the proposal to the sultan? His majestic presence and the
lustre of his court would absolutely confound me, who used even
to tremble before my dear husband your father, when I asked him
for any thing. There is another reason, my son, which you do not
think of, which is that nobody ever goes to ask a favour of the
sultan without a present. But what presents have you to make? And
if you had any that were worthy of the least attention of so
great a monarch, what proportion could they bear to the favour
you would ask? Therefore, reflect well on what you are about, and
consider, that you aspire to an object which it is impossible for
you to obtain."</p>

<p id="id02905">Alla ad Deen heard very calmly all that his mother could say to
dissuade him from his design, and after he had weighed her
representations in all points, replied: "I own, mother, it is
great rashness in me to presume to carry my pretensions so far;
and a great want of consideration to ask you with so much heat
and precipitancy to go and make the proposal to the sultan,
without first taking proper measures to procure a favourable
reception, and therefore beg your pardon. But be not surprised
that through the violence of my passion I did not at first see
every measure necessary to procure me the happiness I seek. I
love the princess, or rather I adore her, and shall always
persevere in my design of marrying her. I am obliged to you for
the hint you have given me, and look upon it as the first step I
ought to take to procure the happy issue I promise myself.</p>

<p id="id02906">"You say it is not customary to go to the sultan without a
present, and that I have nothing worthy of his acceptance. As to
the necessity of a present, I agree with you, and own that I
never thought of it; but as to what you say that I have nothing
fit to offer, do not you think, mother, that what I brought home
with me the day on which I was delivered from an inevitable
death, may be an acceptable present? I mean what you and I both
took for coloured glass: but now I am undeceived, and can tell
you that they are jewels of inestimable value, and fit for the
greatest monarchs. I know the worth of them by frequenting the
shops; and you may take my word that all the precious stones
which I saw in the most capital jewellers' possessions were not
to be compared to those we have, either for size or beauty, and
yet they value theirs at an excessive price. In short, neither
you nor I know the value of ours; but be it as it may, by the
little experience I have, I am persuaded that they will be
received very favourably by the sultan: you have a large
porcelain dish fit to hold them; fetch it, and let us see how
they will look, when we have arranged them according to their
different colours."</p>

<p id="id02907">Alla ad Deen's mother brought the china dish, when he took the
jewels out of the two purses in which he had kept them, and
placed them in order according to his fancy. But the brightness
and lustre they emitted in the day-time, and the variety of the
colours, so dazzled the eyes both of mother and son, that they
were astonished beyond measure; for they had only seen them by
the light of a lamp; and though the latter had beheld them
pendant on the trees like fruit beautiful to the eye, yet as he
was then but a boy, he looked on them only as glittering
playthings.</p>

<p id="id02908">After they had admired the beauty of the jewels some time, Alla
ad Deen said to his mother, "Now you cannot excuse yourself from
going to the sultan, under pretext of not having a present to
make him, since here is one which will gain you a favourable
reception."</p>

<p id="id02909">Though the good widow, notwithstanding the beauty and lustre of
the precious stones, did not believe them so valuable as her son
estimated them, she thought such a present might nevertheless be
agreeable to the sultan, but still she hesitated at the request.
"My son," said she, "I cannot conceive that your present will
have its desired effect, or that the sultan will look upon me
with a favourable eye; I am sure, that if I attempt to deliver
your strange message, I shall have no power to open my mouth;
therefore I shall not only lose my labour, but the present, which
you say is so invaluable, and shall return home again in
confusion, to tell you that your hopes are frustrated. I have
represented the consequence, and you ought to believe me; but,"
added she, "I will exert my best endeavour to please you, and
wish I may have power to ask the sultan as you would have me; but
certainly he will either laugh at me, send me back like a fool,
or be in so great a rage, as to make us both the victims of his
fury."</p>

<p id="id02910">She used many other arguments to endeavour to make him change his
mind; but the charms of the princess had made too great an
impression on his heart for him to be dissuaded from his design.
He persisted in importuning his mother to execute his resolution,
and she, as much out of tenderness as for fear he should be
guilty of greater extravagance, complied with his request.</p>

<p id="id02911">As it was now late, and the time for admission to the palace was
passed, it was put off till the next day. The mother and son
talked of different matters the remaining part of the day; and
Alla ad Deen strove to encourage her in the task she had
undertaken; while she, notwithstanding all his arguments, could
not persuade herself she should succeed; and it must be confessed
she had reason enough to doubt. "Child," said she to Alla ad
Deen, "if the sultan should receive me as favourably as I wish
for your sake, should even hear my proposal with calmness, and
after this scarcely-to-be-expected reception should think of
asking me where lie your riches and your estate (for he will
sooner inquire after these than your person), if, I say, he
should ask me these questions, what answer would you have me
return him?"</p>

<p id="id02912">"Let us not be uneasy, mother," replied Alla ad Deen, "about what
may never happen. First, let us see how the sultan receives, and
what answer he gives you. If it should so fall out, that he
desires to be informed of what you mention, I have thought of an
answer, and am confident that the lamp which hath supported us so
long will not fail me in time of need."</p>

<p id="id02913">The tailor's widow could not say any thing against what her son
then proposed; but reflected that the lamp might be capable of
doing greater wonders than just providing victuals for them. This
consideration satisfied her, and at the same time removed all the
difficulties which might have prevented her from undertaking the
service she had promised her son with the sultan. Alla ad Deen,
who penetrated into his mother's thoughts, said to her, "Above
all things, mother, be sure to keep secret our possession of the
lamp, for thereon depends the success we have to expect;" and
after this caution, Alla ad Deen and his mother parted to go to
rest. But violent love, and the great prospect of so immense a
fortune, had so much possessed the son's thoughts, that he could
not repose himself so well as he could have wished. He rose
before day-break, awakened his mother, pressing her to get
herself dressed to go to the sultan's palace, and to get
admittance, if possible, before the grand vizier, the other
viziers, and the great officers of state went in to take their
seats in the divan, where the sultan always assisted in person.</p>

<p id="id02914">Alla ad Deen's mother took the china dish, in which they had put
the jewels the day before, wrapped in two napkins, one finer than
the other, which was tied at the four corners for more easy
carriage, and set forward for the sultan's palace. When she came
to the gates, the grand vizier, the other viziers and most
distinguished lords of the court, were just gone in; but,
notwithstanding the crowd of people who had business was great,
she got into the divan, a spacious hall, the entrance into which
was very magnificent. She placed herself just before the sultan,
grand vizier, and the great lords, who sat in council, on his
right and left hand. Several causes were called, according to
their order, pleaded and adjudged, until the time the divan
generally broke up, when the sultan rising, returned to his
apartment, attended by the grand vizier; the other viziers and
ministers of state then retired, as also did those whose business
had called them thither; some pleased with gaining their causes,
others dissatisfied at the sentences pronounced against them, and
some in expectation of theirs being heard the next sitting.</p>

<p id="id02915">Alla ad Deen's mother, seeing the sultan retire, and all the
people depart, judged rightly that he would not sit again that
day, and resolved to go home. When Alla ad Deen saw her return
with the present designed for the sultan, he knew not what to
think of her success, and in his fear lest she should bring him
some ill news, had not courage to ask her any questions; but she,
who had never set foot in the sultan's palace before, and knew
not what was every day practised there, freed him from his
embarrassment, and said to him, with a great deal of simplicity,
"Son, I have seen the sultan, and am very well persuaded he has
seen me too; for I placed myself just before him; but he was so
much taken up with those who attended on all sides of him, that I
pitied him, and wondered at his patience. At last I believe he
was heartily tired, for he rose up suddenly, and would not hear a
great many who were ready prepared to speak to him, but went
away, at which I was well pleased, for indeed I began to lose all
patience, and was extremely fatigued with staying so long. But
there is no harm done; I will go again to-morrow; perhaps the
sultan may not be so busy."</p>

<p id="id02916">Though his passion was very violent, Alla ad Deen was forced to
be satisfied with this delay, and to fortify himself with
patience. He had at least the satisfaction to find that his
mother had got over the greatest difficulty, which was to procure
access to the sultan, and hoped that the example of those she saw
speak to him would embolden her to acquit herself better of her
commission when a favourable opportunity might offer to speak to
him.</p>

<p id="id02917">The next morning she repaired to the sultan's palace with the
present, as early as the day before, but when she came there, she
found the gates of the divan shut, and understood that the
council sat but every other day, therefore she must come again
the next. This news she carried to her son, whose only relief was
to guard himself with patience. She went six times afterwards on
the days appointed, placed herself always directly before the
sultan, but with as little success as the first morning, and
might have perhaps come a thousand times to as little purpose, if
luckily the sultan himself had not taken particular notice of
her: for only those who came with petitions approached the
sultan, when each pleaded their cause in its turn, and Alla ad
Deen's mother was not one of them.</p>

<p id="id02918">On the sixth day, however, after the divan was broken up, when
the sultan returned to his own apartment, he said to his grand
vizier, "I have for some time observed a certain woman, who
attends constantly every day that I give audience, with something
wrapped up in a napkin: she always stands up from the beginning
to the breaking up of the audience, and affects to place herself
just before me. Do you know what she wants?"</p>

<p id="id02919">"Sir," replied the grand vizier, who knew no more than the sultan
what she wanted, but did not wish to seem uninformed, "your
majesty knows that women often make complaints on trifles;
perhaps she may come to complain to your majesty that somebody
has sold her some bad flour, or some such trifling matter." The
sultan was not satisfied with this answer, but replied, "If this
woman comes to our next audience, do not fail to call her, that I
may hear what she has to say." The grand vizier made answer by
lowering his hand, and then lifting it up above his head,
signifying his willingness to lose it if he failed.</p>

<p id="id02920">By this time, the tailor's widow was so much used to go to
audience, and stand before the sultan, that she did not think it
any trouble, if she could but satisfy her son that she neglected
nothing that lay in her power to please him: the next audience
day she went to the divan, placed herself in front of the sultan
as usual; and before the grand vizier had made his report of
business, the sultan perceived her, and compassionating her for
having waited so long, said to the vizier, "Before you enter upon
any business, remember the woman I spoke to you about; bid her
come near, and let us hear and dispatch her business first." The
grand vizier immediately called the chief of the mace-bearers who
stood ready to obey his commands; and pointing to her, bade him
go to that woman, and tell her to come before the sultan.</p>

<p id="id02921">The chief of the officers went to Alla ad Deen's mother, and at a
sign he gave her, she followed him to the foot of the sultan's
throne, where he left her, and retired to his place by the grand
vizier. The old woman, after the example of others whom she saw
salute the sultan, bowed her head down to the carpet, which
covered the platform of the throne, and remained in that posture
till the sultan bade her rise, which she had no sooner done, than
he said to her, "Good woman, I have observed you to stand a long
time, from the beginning to the rising of the divan; what
business brings you here?"</p>

<p id="id02922">After these words, Alla ad Deen's mother prostrated herself a
second time; and when she arose, said, "Monarch of monarchs,
before I tell your majesty the extraordinary and almost
incredible business which brings me before your high throne, I
beg of you to pardon the boldness or rather impudence of the
demand I am going to make, which is so uncommon, that I tremble,
and am ashamed to propose it to my sovereign." In order to give
her the more freedom to explain herself, the sultan ordered all
to quit the divan but the grand vizier, and then told her she
might speak without restraint.</p>

<p id="id02923">Alla ad Deen's mother, not content with this favour of the
sultan's to save her the trouble and confusion of speaking before
so many people, was notwithstanding for securing herself against
his anger, which, from the proposal she was going to make, she
was not a little apprehensive of; therefore resuming her
discourse, she said, "I beg of your majesty, if you should think
my demand the least injurious or offensive, to assure me first of
your pardon and forgiveness." "Well," replied the sultan, "I will
forgive you, be it what it may, and no hurt shall come to you:
speak boldly."</p>

<p id="id02924">When Alla ad Deen's mother had taken all these precautions, for
fear of the sultan's anger, she told him faithfully how Alla ad
Deen had seen the princess Buddir al Buddoor, the violent love
that fatal sight had inspired him with, the declaration he had
made to her of it when he came home, and what representations she
had made "to dissuade him from a passion no less disrespectful,"
said she, "to your majesty, as sultan, than to the princess your
daughter. But," continued she, "my son, instead of taking my
advice and reflecting on his presumption, was so obstinate as to
persevere, and to threaten me with some desperate act, if I
refused to come and ask the princess in marriage of your majesty;
and it was not without the greatest reluctance that I was led to
accede to his request, for which I beg your majesty once more to
pardon not only me, but also Alla ad Deen my son, for
entertaining so rash a project as to aspire to so high an
alliance."</p>

<p id="id02925">The sultan hearkened to this discourse with mildness, and without
shewing the least anger; but before he gave her any answer, asked
her what she had brought tied up in the napkin. She took the
china dish, which she had set down at the foot of the throne,
before she prostrated herself before him; untied it, and
presented it to the sultan.</p>

<p id="id02926">The sultan's amazement and surprise were inexpressible, when he
saw so many large, beautiful, and valuable jewels collected in
the dish. He remained for some time motionless with admiration.
At last, when he had recovered himself, he received the present
from Alla ad Deen's mother's hand, crying out in a transport of
joy, "How rich, how beautiful!" After he had admired and handled
all the jewels, one after another, he turned to his grand vizier,
and shewing him the dish, said, "Behold, admire, wonder, and
confess that your eyes never beheld jewels so rich and beautiful
before." The vizier was charmed. "Well," continued the sultan,
"what sayst thou to such a present? Is it not worthy of the
princess my daughter? And ought I not to bestow her on one who
values her at so great price?"</p>

<p id="id02927">These words put the grand vizier into extreme agitation. The
sultan had some time before signified to him his intention of
bestowing the princess on a son of his; therefore he was afraid,
and not without grounds, that the sultan, dazzled by so rich and
extraordinary a present, might change his mind. Therefore going
to him, and whispering him in the ear, he said, "I cannot but own
that the present is worthy of the princess; but I beg of your
majesty to grant me three months before you come to a final
resolution. I hope, before that time, my son, on whom you have
had the goodness to look with a favourable eye, will be able to
make a nobler present than Alla ad Deen, who is an entire
stranger to Your majesty."</p>

<p id="id02928">The sultan, though he was fully persuaded that it was not
possible for the vizier to provide so considerable a present for
his son to make the princess, yet as he had given him hopes,
hearkened to him, and granted his request. Turning therefore to
the old widow, he said to her, "Good woman, go home, and tell
your son that I agree to the proposal you have made me; but I
cannot marry the princess my daughter, till the paraphernalia I
design for her be got ready, which cannot be finished these three
months; but at the expiration of that time come again."</p>

<p id="id02929">Alla ad Deen's mother returned home much more gratified than she
had expected, since she had met with a favourable answer, instead
of the refusal and confusion she had dreaded. From two
circumstances Alla ad Deen, when he saw his mother returning,
judged that she brought him good news; the one was, that she
returned sooner than ordinary; and the other, the gaiety of her
countenance. "Well, mother," said he, "may I entertain any hopes,
or must I die with despair?" When she had pulled off her veil,
and had seated herself on the sofa by him, she said to him, "Not
to keep you long in suspense, son, I will begin by telling you,
that instead of thinking of dying, you have every reason to be
well satisfied." Then pursuing her discourse, she told him, that
she had an audience before everybody else which made her come
home so soon; the precautions she had taken lest she should have
displeased the sultan, by making the proposal of marriage between
him and the princess Buddir al Buddoor, and the condescending
answer she had received from the sultan's own mouth; and that as
far as she could judge, the present had wrought a powerful
effect. "But when I least expected it," said she, "and he was
going to give me an answer, and I fancied a favourable one, the
grand vizier whispered him in the ear, and I was afraid might be
some obstacle to his good intentions towards us, and so it
happened, for the sultan desired me to come to audience again
this day three months."</p>

<p id="id02930">Alla ad Deen thought himself the most happy of all men at hearing
this news, and thanked his mother for the pains she had taken in
the affair, the good success of which was of so great importance
to his peace. Though from his impatience to obtain the object of
his passion, three months seemed an age, yet he disposed himself
to wait with patience, relying on the sultan's word, which he
looked upon to be irrevocable. But all that time he not only
counted the hours, days, and weeks, but every moment. When two of
the three months were past, his mother one evening going to light
the lamp, and finding no oil in the house, went out to buy some,
and when she came into the city, found a general rejoicing. The
shops, instead of being shut up, were open, dressed with foliage,
silks, and carpeting, every one striving to show their zeal in
the most distinguished manner according to his ability. The
streets were crowded with officers in habits of ceremony, mounted
on horses richly caparisoned, each attended by a great many
footmen. Alla ad Deen's mother asked the oil-merchant what was
the meaning of all this preparation of public festivity. "Whence
came you, good woman," said he, "that you don't know that the
grand vizier's son is to marry the princess Buddir al Buddoor,
the sultan's daughter, to-night? She will presently return from
the baths; and these officers whom you see are to assist at the
cavalcade to the palace, where the ceremony is to be solemnized."</p>

<p id="id02931">This was news enough for Alla ad Deen's mother. She ran till she
was quite out of breath home to her son, who little suspected any
such event. "Child," cried she, "you are undone! You depend upon
the sultan's fine promises, but they will come to nothing." Alla
ad Deen was alarmed at these words. "Mother," replied he, "how do
you know the sultan has been guilty of a breach of promise?"
"This night," answered the mother, "the grand vizier's son is to
marry the princess Buddir al Buddoor." She then related how she
had heard it; so that from all circumstances, he had no reason to
doubt the truth of what she said.</p>

<p id="id02932">At this account, Alla ad Deen was thunder-struck. Any other man
would have sunk under the shock; but a sudden hope of
disappointing his rival soon roused his spirits, and he bethought
himself of the lamp, which had on every emergence been so useful
to him; and without venting his rage in empty words against the
sultan, the vizier, or his son, he only said, "Perhaps, mother,
the vizier's son may not be so happy to-night as he promises
himself: while I go into my chamber a moment, do you get supper
ready." She accordingly went about it, but guessed that her son
was going to make use of the lamp, to prevent, if possible, the
consummation of the marriage.</p>

<p id="id02933">When Alla ad Deen had got into his chamber, he took the lamp,
rubbed it in the same place as before, when immediately the genie
appeared, and said to him, "What wouldst thou have? I am ready to
obey thee as thy slave, and the slave of all those who have that
lamp in their possession; I and the other slaves of the lamp."
"Hear me," said Alla ad Deen; "thou hast hitherto brought me
whatever I wanted as to provisions; but now I have business of
the greatest importance for thee to execute. I have demanded the
princess Buddir al Buddoor in marriage of the sultan her father;
he promised her to me, only requiring three months delay; but
instead of keeping that promise, has this night married her to
the grand vizier's son. What I ask of you is, that as soon as the
bride and bridegroom are retired, you bring them both hither in
their bed." "Master," replied the genie, "I will obey you. Have
you any other commands?" "None at present," answered Alla ad
Deen; the genie then disappeared.</p>

<p id="id02934">Alla ad Deen having left his chamber, supped with his mother,
with the same tranquillity of mind as usual; and after supper
talked of the princess's marriage as of an affair wherein he had
not the least concern'; he then retired to his own chamber again,
and left his mother to go to bed; but sat up waiting the
execution of his orders to the genie.</p>

<p id="id02935">In the meantime, everything was prepared with the greatest
magnificence in the sultan's palace to celebrate the princess's
nuptials; and the evening was spent with all the usual ceremonies and
great rejoicings till midnight, when the grand vizier's son, on a
signal given him by the chief of the princess's eunuchs, slipped away
from the company, and was introduced by that officer into the
princess's apartment, where the nuptial bed was prepared. He went to
bed first, and in a little time after, the sultaness, accompanied by
her own women, and those of the princess, brought the bride, who,
according to the custom of new-married ladies, made great resistance.
The sultaness herself helped to undress her, put her into bed by a
kind of violence: and after having kissed her, and wished her good
night, retired with the women to her own apartments.</p>

<p id="id02936">No sooner was the door shut, than the genie, as the faithful
slave of the lamp, and punctual in executing the command of those
who possessed it, without giving the bridegroom the least time to
caress his bride, to the great amazement of them both, took up
the bed, and transported it in an instant into Alla ad Deen's
chamber, where he set it down.</p>

<p id="id02937">Alla ad Deen, who had waited impatiently for this moment, did not
suffer the vizier's son to remain long in bed with the princess. "Take
this new-married man," said he to the genie, "shut him up in the
out-house, and come again tomorrow morning before day-break." The
genie instantly forced the vizier's son out of bed, carried him
whither Alla ad Deen had commanded him; and after he had breathed upon
him, which prevented him stirring, left him there.</p>

<p id="id02938">Passionate as was Alla ad Deen's love for the princess, he did
not talk much to her when they were alone; but only said with a
respectful air, "Fear nothing, adorable princess, you are here in
safety; for, notwithstanding the violence of my passion, which
your charms have kindled, it shall never exceed the bounds of the
profound adoration I owe you. If I have been forced to come to
this extremity, it is not with any intention of affronting you,
but to prevent an unjust rival's possessing you, contrary to the
sultan your father's promise in favour of myself."</p>

<p id="id02939">The princess, who knew nothing of these particulars, gave very
little attention to what Alla ad Deen could say. The fright and
amazement of so surprising and unexpected an adventure had
alarmed her so much that he could not get one word from her.
However, he undressed himself, took the bridegroom's place, but
lay with his back to the princess, putting a sabre between
himself and her, to shew that he deserved to be put to death, if
he attempted anything against her honour. Alla ad Deen, satisfied
with having thus deprived his rival of the happiness he had
flattered himself with, slept very soundly, though the princess
Buddir al Buddoor never passed a night so ill in her life; and if
we consider the condition in which the genie left the grand
vizier's son, we may imagine that the new bridegroom spent it
much worse.</p>

<p id="id02940">Alla ad Deen had no occasion the next morning to rub the lamp to
call the genie; who appeared at the hour appointed, just when he
had done dressing himself, and said to him, "I am here, master,
what are your commands?" "Go," said Alla ad Deen, "fetch the
vizier's son out of the place where you left him, put him into
his bed again, and carry it to the sultan's palace, from whence
you brought it." The genie presently returned with the vizier's
son. Alla ad Deen took up his sabre, the bridegroom was laid by
the princess, and in an instant the nuptial-bed was transported
into the same chamber of the palace from whence it had been
brought. But we must observe, that all this time the genie never
was visible either to the princess or the grand vizier's son. His
hideous form would have made them die with fear. Neither did they
hear any thing of the discourse between Alla ad Deen and him;
they only perceived the motion of the bed, and their
transportation from one place to another; which we may well
imagine was enough to alarm them.</p>

<p id="id02941">As soon as the genie had set down the nuptial bed in its proper
place, the sultan tapped at the door to wish her good morning.
The grand vizier's son, who was almost perished with cold, by
standing in his thin under garment all night, and had not had
time to warm himself in bed, no sooner heard the knocking at the
door than he got out of bed, and ran into the robing-chamber,
where he had undressed himself the night before.</p>

<p id="id02942">The sultan having opened the door, went to the bed-side, kissed
the princess between the eyes, according to custom, wishing her a
good morrow, but was extremely surprised to see her so
melancholy. She only cast at him a sorrowful look, expressive of
great affliction or great dissatisfaction. He said a few words to
her; but finding that he could not get a word from her,
attributed it to her modesty, and retired. Nevertheless, he
suspected that there was something extraordinary in this silence,
and thereupon went immediately to the sultaness's apartment, told
her in what a state he had found the princess, and how she had
received him. "Sir," said the sultaness, "your majesty ought not
to be surprised at this behaviour; new-married people have
naturally a reserve about them; two or three days hence she will
receive the sultan her father as she ought: but I will go and see
her," added she; "I am much deceived if she receives me in the
same manner."</p>

<p id="id02943">As soon as the sultaness was dressed, she went to the princess's
apartment, who was still in bed. She undrew the curtain, wished
her good morrow, and kissed her. But how great was her surprise
when she returned no answer; and looking more attentively at her,
she perceived her to be much dejected, which made her judge that
something had happened, which she did not understand "How comes
it, child," said the sultaness, "that you do not return my
caresses? Ought you to treat your mother after this manner? I am
induced to believe something extraordinary has happened; come,
tell me freely, and leave me no longer in a painful suspense."</p>

<p id="id02944">At last the princess broke silence with a deep sigh, and said,
"Alas! most honoured mother, forgive me if I have failed in the
respect I owe you. My mind is so full of the extraordinary
circumstances which have befallen me this night, that I have not
yet recovered my amazement and alarm." She then told her, how the
instant after she and her husband were together, the bed was
transported into a dark dirty room, where he was taken from her
and carried away, but where she knew not; and that she was left
alone with a young man, who, after he had said something to her,
which her fright did not suffer her to hear, laid himself in her
husband's place, but first put his sabre between them; and in the
morning her husband was brought to her again, when the bed was
transported back to her own chamber in an instant. "All this,"
said she, "was but just done, when the sultan my father came into
my chamber. I was so overwhelmed with grief, that I had not power
to speak, and am afraid that he is offended at the manner in
which I received the honour he did me; but I hope he will forgive
me, when he knows my melancholy adventure, and the miserable
state I am in at present."</p>

<p id="id02945">The sultaness heard all the princess told her very patiently, but
would not believe it. "You did well, child," said she, "not to
speak of this to your father: take care not to mention it to
anybody; for you will certainly be thought mad if you talk in
this manner." "Madam," replied the princess, "I can assure you I
am in my right senses; ask my husband, and he will tell you the
same circumstances." "I will," said the sultaness, "but if he
should talk in the same manner, I shall not be better persuaded
of the truth. Come, rise, and throw off this idle fancy; it will
be a strange event, if all the feasts and rejoicings in the
kingdom should be interrupted by such a vision. Do not you hear
the trumpets of congratulation, and concerts of the finest music?
Cannot these inspire you with joy and pleasure, and make you
forget the fancies of an imagination disturbed by what can have
been only a dream?" At the same time the sultaness called the
princess's women, and after she had seen her get up, and begin
dressing, went to the sultan's apartment, told him that her
daughter had got some odd notions in her head, but that there was
nothing in them but idle phantasy.</p>

<p id="id02946">She then sent for the vizier's son, to know of him something of
what the princess had told her; but he, thinking himself highly
honoured to be allied to the sultan, and not willing to lose the
princess, denied what had happened. "That is enough," answered
the sultaness, "I ask no more, I see you are wiser than my
daughter."</p>

<p id="id02947">The rejoicings lasted all that day in the palace, and the
sultaness, who never left the princess, forgot nothing to divert
her, and induce her to take part in the various diversions and
shows; but she was so struck with the idea of what had happened
to her in the night, that it was easy to see her thoughts were
entirely taken up with it. Neither was the grand vizier's son in
less tribulation, though his ambition made him disguise his
feelings so well, that nobody doubted of his being a happy
bridegroom.</p>

<p id="id02948">Alla ad Deen, who was well acquainted with what passed in the palace,
was sure the new-married couple were to sleep together again,
notwithstanding the troublesome adventure of the night before; and
therefore, having as great an inclination to disturb them, had
recourse to his lamp, and when the genie appeared, and offered his
service, he said to him, "The grand vizier's son and the princess
Buddir al Buddoor are to sleep together again to-night: go, and as
soon as they are in bed, bring the bed hither, as thou didst
yesterday."</p>

<p id="id02949">The genie obeyed as faithfully and exactly as the day before; the
grand vizier's son passed the night as coldly and disagreeably,
and the princess had the mortification again to have Alla ad Deen
for her bed-fellow, with the sabre between them. The genie,
according to orders, came the next morning, brought the
bridegroom, laid him by his bride, and then carried the bed and
new-married couple back again to the palace.</p>

<p id="id02950">The sultan, after the reception the princess had given him, was
very anxious to know how she had passed the second night, and
therefore went into her chamber as early as the morning before.
The grand vizier's son, more ashamed and mortified with the ill
success of this last night, no sooner heard him coming, than he
jumped out of bed, and ran hastily into the robing-chamber. The
sultan went to the princess's bed-side, and after the same
caresses he had given her the former morning, bade her good
morrow. "Well daughter," said he, "are you in a better humour
than yesterday?" Still the princess was silent, and the sultan
perceiving her to be more troubled, and in greater confusion than
before, doubted not that something very extraordinary was the
cause; but provoked that his daughter should conceal it, he said
to her in a rage, with his sabre in his hand, "Daughter, tell me
what is the matter, or I will cut off your head immediately."</p>

<p id="id02951">The princess, more frightened at the menaces and tone of the
enraged sultan than at the sight of the drawn sabre, at last
broke silence, and said with tears in her eyes, "My dear father
and sultan, I ask your majesty's pardon if I have offended you,
and hope, that out of your goodness and clemency you will have
compassion on me, when I shall have told you in what a miserable
condition I have spent this last night, as well as the
preceding."</p>

<p id="id02952">After this preamble, which appeased and affected the sultan, she
told him what had happened to her in so moving a manner, that he,
who loved her tenderly, was most sensibly grieved. She added, "If
your majesty doubts the truth of this account, you may inform
yourself from my husband, who, I am persuaded, will tell you the
same thing."</p>

<p id="id02953">The sultan immediately felt all the extreme uneasiness so
surprising an adventure must have given the princess. "Daughter,"
said he, "you are much to blame for not telling me this
yesterday, since it concerns me as much as yourself. I did not
marry you with an intention to make you miserable, but that you
might enjoy all the happiness you deserve and might hope for from
a husband who to me seemed agreeable to you. Efface all these
troublesome ideas from your memory; I will take care that you
shall have no more disagreeable and insupportable nights."</p>

<p id="id02954">As soon as the sultan had returned to his own apartment, he sent
for the grand vizier: "Vizier," said he, "have you seen your son,
and has he told you anything?" The vizier replied, "No." The
sultan related all the circumstances of which the princess had
informed him, and afterwards said, "I do not doubt but that my
daughter has told me the truth; but nevertheless I should be glad
to have it confirmed by your son, therefore go and ask him how it
was."</p>

<p id="id02955">The grand vizier went immediately to his son, communicated what
the sultan had told him, and enjoined him to conceal nothing, but
to relate the whole truth. "I will disguise nothing from you,
father," replied the son, "for indeed all that the princess has
stated is true; but what relates particularly to myself she knows
nothing of. Since my marriage, I have passed two nights beyond
imagination or expression disagreeable, not to mention the fright
I was in at finding my bed lifted four times, transported from
one place to another, without being able to guess how it was
done. You may judge of the miserable condition I was in, passing
two whole nights in nothing but my under vestments, standing in a
kind of closet, unable to stir out of the place or to make the
least movement, though I could not perceive any obstacle to
prevent me. Yet I must tell you, that all this ill usage does not
in the least lessen those sentiments of love, respect, and
gratitude I entertain for the princess, and of which she is so
deserving; but I must confess, that notwithstanding all the
honour and splendour that attends marrying my sovereign's
daughter, I would much rather die, than continue in so exalted an
alliance if I must undergo nightly much longer what I have
already endured. I do not doubt but that the princess entertains
the same sentiments, and that she will readily agree to a
separation, which is so necessary both for her repose and mine.
Therefore, father, I beg, by the same tenderness which led you to
procure me so great an honour, to obtain the sultan's consent
that our marriage may be declared null and void."</p>

<p id="id02956">Notwithstanding the grand vizier's ambition to have his son
allied to the sultan, the firm resolution he saw he had formed to
be separated from the princess made him not think it proper to
propose to him to have patience for a few days, to see if this
disappointment would not have an end; but he left him to give an
account of what he had related to him, and without waiting till
the sultan himself, whom he found disposed to it, spoke of
setting aside the marriage, he begged of him to give his son
leave to retire from the palace, alleging it was not just that
the princess should be a moment longer exposed to so terrible a
persecution upon his son's account.</p>

<p id="id02957">The grand vizier found no great difficulty to obtain what he
asked, as the sultan had determined already; orders were given to
put a stop to all rejoicings in the palace and town, and
expresses dispatched to all parts of his dominions to countermand
them; and, in a short time, all rejoicings ceased.</p>

<p id="id02958">This sudden and unexpected change gave rise both in the city and
kingdom to various speculations and inquiries; but no other
account could be given of it, except that both the vizier and his
son went out of the palace very much dejected. Nobody but Alla ad
Deen knew the secret. He rejoiced within himself at the happy
success procured by his lamp, which now he had no more occasion
to rub, to produce the genie to prevent the consummation of the
marriage, as he had certain information it was broken off, and
that his rival had left the palace. Neither the sultan nor the
grand vizier, who had forgotten Alla ad Deen and his request, had
the least thought that he had any concern in the enchantment
which caused the dissolution of the marriage.</p>

<p id="id02959">Alla ad Deen waited till the three months were completed, which
the sultan had appointed for the consummation of the marriage
between the princess Buddir al Buddoor and himself; and the next
day sent his mother to the palace, to remind the sultan of his
promise.</p>

<p id="id02960">Alla ad Deen's mother went to the palace, and stood in the same
place as before in the hall of audience. The sultan no sooner
cast his eyes upon her than he knew her again, remembered her
business, and how long he had put her off: therefore when the
grand vizier was beginning to make his report, the sultan
interrupted him, and said, "Vizier, I see the good woman who made
me the present of jewels some months ago; forbear your report,
till I have heard what she has to say." The vizier looking about
the divan, perceived the tailor's widow, and sent the chief of
the mace-bearers to conduct her to the sultan.</p>

<p id="id02961">Alla ad Deen's mother came to the foot of the throne, prostrated
herself as usual, and when she rose, the sultan asked her what
she would have. "Sir," said she, "I come to represent to your
majesty, in the name of my son Alla ad Deen, that the three
months, at the end of which you ordered me to come again, are
expired; and to beg you to remember your promise."</p>

<p id="id02962">The sultan, when he had fixed a time to answer the request of
this good woman, little thought of hearing any more of a
marriage, which he imagined must be very disagreeable to the
princess, when he considered the meanness and poverty of her
dress and appearance; but this summons for him to fulfill his
promise was somewhat embarrassing; he declined giving an answer
till he had consulted his vizier, and signified to trim the
little inclination he had to conclude a match for his daughter
with a stranger, whose rank he supposed to be very mean.</p>

<p id="id02963">The grand vizier freely told the sultan his thoughts, and said to
him, "In my opinion, sir, there is an infallible way for your
majesty to avoid a match so disproportionable, without giving
Alla ad Deen, were he known to your majesty, any cause of
complaint; which is, to set so high a price upon the princess,
that, however rich he may be, he cannot comply with. This is the
only evasion to make him desist from so bold, not to say rash, an
undertaking, which he never weighed before he engaged in it."</p>

<p id="id02964">The sultan, approving of the grand vizier's advice, turned to the
tailor's widow, and said to her, "Good woman, it is true sultans
ought to abide by their word, and I am ready to keep mine, by
making your son happy in marriage with the princess my daughter.
But as I cannot marry her without some further valuable
consideration from your son, you may tell him, I will fulfill my
promise as soon as he shall send me forty trays of massive gold,
full of the same sort of jewels you have already made me a
present of, and carried by the like number of black slaves, who
shall be led by as many young and handsome white slaves, all
dressed magnificently. On these conditions I am ready to bestow
the princess my daughter upon him; therefore, good woman, go and
tell him so, and I will wait till you bring me his answer."</p>

<p id="id02965">Alla ad Deen's mother prostrated herself a second time before the
sultan's throne, and retired. In her way home, she laughed within
herself at her son's foolish imagination. "Where," says she, "can
he get so many large gold trays, and such precious stones to fill
them? Must he go again to that subterraneous abode, the entrance
into which is stopped up, and gather them off the trees? But
where will he get so many such slaves as the sultan requires? It
is altogether out of his power, and I believe he will not be much
pleased with my embassy this time." When she came home, full of
these thoughts, she said to her son, "Indeed, child, I would not
have you think any farther of your marriage with the princess.
The sultan received me very kindly, and I believe he was well
inclined to you; but if I am not much deceived the grand vizier
has made him change his mind, as you will guess from what I have
to tell you. After I had represented to his majesty that the
three months were expired, and begged of him to remember his
promise, I observed that he whispered with his grand vizier
before he gave me his answer." She then gave her son an exact
account of what the sultan had said to her, and the conditions on
which he consented to the match. Afterwards she said to him, "The
sultan expects your answer immediately; but," continued she,
laughing, "I believe he may wait long enough."</p>

<p id="id02966">"Not so long, mother, as you imagine," replied Alla ad Deen: "the
sultan is mistaken, if he thinks by this exorbitant demand to
prevent my entertaining thoughts of the princess. I expected
greater difficulties, and that he would have set a higher price
upon her incomparable charms. I am very well pleased; his demand
is but a trifle to what I could have done for her. But while I
think of satisfying his request, go and get something for our
dinner, and leave the rest to me."</p>

<p id="id02967">As soon as his mother was gone out to market, Alla ad Deen took
the lamp, and rubbing it, the genie appeared, and offered his
service as usual. "The sultan," said Alla ad Deen to him, "gives
me the princess his daughter in marriage; but demands first forty
large trays of massive gold, full of the fruits of the garden
from whence I took this lamp; and these he expects to have
carried by as many black slaves, each preceded by a young
handsome white slave, richly clothed. Go, and fetch me this
present as soon as possible, that I may send it to him before the
divan breaks up."</p>

<p id="id02968">The genie told him his command should be immediately obeyed, and
disappeared.</p>

<p id="id02969">In a little time afterwards the genie returned with forty black
slaves, each bearing on his head a heavy tray of pure gold, full
of pearls, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and every sort of precious
stones, all larger and more beautiful than those presented to the
sultan. Each tray was covered with silver tissue, embroidered
with flowers of gold; these, together with the white slaves,
quite filled the house, which was but a small one, the little
court before it, and a small garden behind. The genie asked if he
had any other commands, and Alla ad Deen telling him that he
wanted nothing farther, he disappeared.</p>

<p id="id02970">When Alla ad Deen's mother came from market, she was much
surprised to see so many people and such vast riches. As soon as
she had laid down her provisions, she was going to pull off her
veil; but he prevented her, and said, "Mother, let us lose no
time; before the sultan and the divan rise, I would have you
return to the palace with this present as the dowry demanded for
the princess, that he may judge by my diligence and exactness of
the ardent and sincere desire I have to procure myself the honour
of this alliance." Without waiting for his mother's reply, Alla
ad Deen opened the street-door, and made the slaves walk out;
each white slave followed by a black with a tray upon his head.
When they were all out, the mother followed the last black slave;
he shut the door, and then retired to his chamber, full of hopes
that the sultan, after this present, which was such as he
required, would receive him as his son-in-law.</p>

<p id="id02971">The first white slave who went out made all the people who were
going by stop; and before they were all clear of the house, the
streets were crowded with spectators, who ran to see so
extraordinary and magnificent a procession. The dress of each
slave was so rich, both for the stuff and the jewels, that those
who were dealers in them valued each at no less than a million of
money; besides the neatness and propriety of the dress, the noble
air, fine shape and proportion of each slave were unparalleled;
their grave walk at an equal distance from each other, the lustre
of the jewels curiously set in their girdles of gold, in
beautiful symmetry, and the egrets of precious stones in their
turbans, which were of an unusual but elegant taste, put the
spectators into such great admiration, that they could not avoid
gazing at them, and following them with their eyes as far as
possible; but the streets were so crowded with people, that none
could move out of the spot they stood on. As they had to pass
through several streets to the palace, a great part of the city
had an opportunity of seeing them. As soon as the first of these
slaves arrived at the palace gate, the porters formed themselves
into order, taking him for a prince from the richness and
magnificence of his habit, and were going to kiss the hem of his
garment; but the slave, who was instructed by the genie,
prevented them, and said, "We are only slaves, our master will
appear at a proper time."</p>

<p id="id02972">The first slave, followed by the rest, advanced into the second
court, which was very spacious, and in which the sultan's
household was ranged during the sitting of the divan. The
magnificence of the officers, who stood at the head of their
troops, was considerably eclipsed by the slaves who bore Alla ad
Deen's present, of which they themselves made a part. Nothing was
ever seen so beautiful and brilliant in the sultan's palace; and
all the lustre of the lords of his court was not to be compared
to them.</p>

<p id="id02973">As the sultan, who had been informed of their march, and approach
to the palace, had given orders for them to be admitted, they met
with no obstacle, but went into the divan in regular order, one
part filing to the right, and the other to the left. After they
were all entered, and had formed a semicircle before the sultan's
throne, the black slaves laid the golden trays on the carpet,
prostrated themselves, touching the carpet with their foreheads,
and at the same time the white slaves did the same. When they
rose, the black slaves uncovered the trays, and then all stood
with their arms crossed over their breasts.</p>

<p id="id02974">In the meantime Alla ad Deen's mother advanced to the foot of the
throne, and having paid her respects, said to the sultan, "Sir,
my son is sensible this present, which he has sent your majesty,
is much below the princess Buddir al Buddoor's worth; but hopes,
nevertheless, that your majesty will accept of it, and make it
agreeable to the princess, and with the greater confidence since
he has endeavoured to conform to the conditions you were pleased
to impose."</p>

<p id="id02975">The sultan was not able to give the least attention to this
compliment. The moment he cast his eyes on the forty trays, full
of the most precious, brilliant, and beautiful jewels he had ever
seen, and the fourscore slaves, who appeared by the elegance of
their persons, and the richness and magnificence of their dress,
like so many princes, he was so struck, that he could not recover
from his admiration. Instead of answering the compliment of Alla
ad Deen's mother, he addressed himself to the grand vizier, who
could not any more than the sultan comprehend from whence such a
profusion of richness could come. "Well, vizier," said he aloud,
"who do you think it can be that has sent me so extraordinary a
present, and neither of us know? Do you think him worthy of the
princess Buddir al Buddoor, my daughter?"</p>

<p id="id02976">The vizier, notwithstanding his envy and grief to see a stranger
preferred to be the sultan's son-in-law before his son, durst not
disguise his sentiments. It was too visible that Alla ad Deen's
present was more than sufficient to merit his being received into
royal alliance; therefore, consulting his master's feelings, he
returned this answer: "I am so far from having any thoughts that
the person who has made your majesty so noble a present is
unworthy of the honour you would do him, that I should say he
deserved much more, if I was not persuaded that the greatest
treasure in the world ought not to be put in competition with the
princess your majesty's daughter." This speech was applauded by
all the lords who were then in council.</p>

<p id="id02977">The sultan made no longer hesitation, nor thought of informing
himself whether Alla ad Deen was endowed with all the
qualifications requisite in one who aspired to be his son-in-law.
The sight alone of such immense riches, and Alla ad Deen's
quickness in satisfying his demand, without starting the least
difficulty at the exorbitant conditions he had imposed, easily
persuaded him, that he could want nothing to render him
accomplished, and such as he desired. Therefore, to send Alla ad
Deen's mother back with all the satisfaction she could desire, he
said to her, "My good lady, go and tell your son that I wait with
open arms to embrace him, and the more haste he makes to come and
receive the princess my daughter from my hands, the greater
pleasure he will do me."</p>

<p id="id02978">As soon as the tailor's widow had retired, overjoyed as a woman
in her condition must have been, to see her son raised beyond all
expectations to such exalted fortune, the sultan put an end to
the audience; and rising from his throne, ordered that the
princess's eunuchs should come and carry the trays into their
mistress's apartment, whither he went himself to examine them
with her at his leisure. The fourscore slaves were conducted in
to the palace; and the sultan, telling the princess of their
magnificent appearance, ordered them to be brought before her
apartment, that she might see through the lattices he had not
exaggerated in his account of them.</p>

<p id="id02979">In the meantime Alla ad Deen's mother got home, and shewed in her
air and countenance the good news she brought her son "My son,"
said she to him, "you have now all the reason in the world to be
pleased: you are, contrary to my expectations, arrived at the
height of your desires. Not to keep you too long in suspense, the
sultan, with the approbation of the whole court, has declared
that you are worthy to possess the princess Buddir al Buddoor,
waits to embrace you and conclude your marriage; therefore, you
must think of making some preparations for your interview, which
may answer the high opinion he has formed of your person; and
after the wonders I have seen you do, I am persuaded nothing can
be wanting. But I must not forget to tell you the sultan waits
for you with great impatience, therefore lose no time in paying
your respects."</p>

<p id="id02980">Alla ad Deen, enraptured with this news, and full of the object
which possessed his soul, made his mother very little reply, but
retired to his chamber. There, after he had rubbed his lamp,
which had never failed him in whatever he wished for, the
obedient genie appeared. "Genie," said Alla ad Deen, "I want to
bathe immediately, and you must afterwards provide me the richest
and most magnificent habit ever worn by a monarch." No sooner
were the words out of his mouth than the genie rendered him, as
well as himself, invisible, and transported him into a hummum of
the finest marble of all sorts of colours; where he was
undressed, without seeing by whom, in a magnificent and spacious
hall. From the hall he was led to the bath, which was of a
moderate heat, and he was there rubbed and washed with various
scented waters. After he had passed through several degrees of
heat, he came out, quite a different man from what he was before.
His skin was clear white and red, his body lightsome and free;
and when he returned into the hall, he found, instead of his own,
a suit, the magnificence of which astonished him. The genie
helped him to dress, and when he had done, transported him back
to his own chamber, where he asked him if he had any other
commands. "Yes," answered Alla ad Deen, "I expect you to bring me
as soon as possible a charger, that surpasses in beauty and
goodness the best in the sultan's stables, with a saddle, bridle,
and other caparisons worth a million of money. I want also twenty
slaves, as richly clothed as those who carried the present to the
sultan, to walk by my side and follow me, and twenty more to go
before me in two ranks. Besides these, bring my mother six women
slaves to attend her, as richly dressed at least as any of the
princess Buddir al Buddoor's, each carrying a complete dress fit
for any sultaness. I want also ten thousand pieces of gold in ten
purses; go, and make haste."</p>

<p id="id02981">As soon as Alla ad Deen had given these orders, the genie
disappeared, but presently returned with the horse, the forty
slaves, ten of whom carried each a purse containing ten thousand
pieces of gold, and six women slaves, each carrying on her head a
different dress for Alla ad Deen's mother, wrapped up in a piece
of silver tissue, and presented them all to Alla ad Deen.</p>

<p id="id02982">Of the ten purses Alla ad Deen took four, which he gave to his
mother, telling her, those were to supply her with necessaries;
the other six he left in the hands of the slaves who brought
them, with an order to throw them by handfuls among the people as
they went to the sultan's palace. The six slaves who carried the
purses he ordered likewise to march before him, three on the
right hand and three on the left. Afterwards he presented the six
women slaves to his mother, telling her they were her slaves, and
that the dresses they had brought were for her use.</p>

<p id="id02983">When Alla ad Deen had thus settled matters, he told the genie he
would call for him when he wanted him, and thereupon the genie
disappeared. Alla ad Deen's thoughts now were only upon
answering, as soon as possible, the desire the sultan had shown
to see him. He dispatched one of the forty slaves to the palace,
with an order to address himself to the chief of the porters, to
know when he might have the honour to come and throw himself at
the sultan's feet. The slave soon acquitted himself of his
commission, and brought for answer, that the sultan waited for
him with impatience.</p>

<p id="id02984">Alla ad Deen immediately mounted his charger, and began his
march, in the order we have already described; and though he
never was on horseback before, appeared with such extraordinary
grace, that the most experienced horseman would not have taken
him for a novice. The streets through which he was to pass were
almost instantly filled with an innumerable concourse of people,
who made the air echo with acclamations, especially every time
the six slaves who carried the purses threw handfuls of gold
among the populace. Neither did these acclamations and shouts of
joy come from those alone who scrambled for the money, but from a
superior rank of people, who could not forbear applauding Alla ad
Deen's generosity. Not only those who knew him when he played in
the streets like a vagabond did not recollect him, but those who
saw him but a little while before hardly recognised him, so much
were his features altered: such were the effects of the lamp, as
to procure by degrees to those who possessed it perfections
suitable to the rank to which the right use of it advanced them.
Much more attention was paid to Alla ad Deen's person than to the
pomp and magnificence of his attendants, as a similar show had
been seen the day before when the slaves walked in procession
with the present to the sultan. Nevertheless the horse was much
admired by good judges, who knew how to discern his beauties,
without being dazzled by the jewels and richness of the
furniture. When the report was everywhere spread, that the sultan
was going to give the princess in marriage to Alla ad Deen,
nobody regarded his birth, nor envied his good fortune, so worthy
he seemed of it in the public opinion.</p>

<p id="id02985">When he arrived at the palace, everything was prepared for his
reception; and when he came to the gate of the second court, he
would have alighted from his horse, agreeably to the custom
observed by the grand vizier, the commander in chief of the
empire, and governors of provinces of the first rank; but the
chief of the mace-bearers who waited on him by the sultan's order
prevented him, and attended him to the grand hall of audience,
where he helped him to dismount; though Alla ad Deen endeavoured
to prevent him, but could not prevail. The officers formed
themselves into two ranks at the entrance of the hall. The chief
put Alla ad Deen on his right hand, and through the midst of them
led him to the sultan's throne.</p>

<p id="id02986">As soon as the sultan perceived Alla ad Deen, he was no less
surprised to see him more richly and magnificently habited than
ever he had been himself, than struck at his good mien, fine
shape, and a certain air of unexpected dignity, very different
from the meanness of his mother's late appearance.</p>

<p id="id02987">But, notwithstanding, his amazement and surprise did not hinder
him from rising off his throne, and descending two or three
steps, quick enough to prevent Alla ad Deen's throwing himself at
his feet. He embraced him with all the demonstrations of joy at
his arrival. After this civility Alla ad Deen would have thrown
himself at his feet again; but he held him fast by the hand, and
obliged him to sit close to the throne.</p>

<p id="id02988">Alla ad Deen then addressed the sultan, saying, "I receive the
honour which your majesty out of your great condescension is
pleased to confer; but permit me to assure you, that I have not
forgotten that I am your slave; that I know the greatness of your
power, and that I am not in sensible how much my birth is below
the splendour and lustre of the high rank to which I am raised.
If any way," continued he, "I could have merited so favourable a
reception, I confess I owe it merely to the boldness which chance
inspired in me to raise my eyes, thoughts, and desires to the
divine princess, who is the object of my wishes. I ask your
majesty's pardon for my rashness, but I cannot dissemble, that I
should die with grief were I to lose my hopes of seeing them
accomplished."</p>

<p id="id02989">"My son," answered the sultan, embracing him a second time, "you
would wrong me to doubt for a moment of my sincerity: your life
from this moment is too dear to me not to preserve it, by
presenting you with the remedy which is at my disposal. I prefer
the pleasure of seeing and hearing you before all your treasure
added to my own."</p>

<p id="id02990">After these words, the sultan gave a signal, and immediately the
air echoed with the sound of trumpets, hautboys, and other
musical instruments: and at the same time the sultan led Alla ad
Deen into a magnificent hall, where was laid out a most splendid
collation. The sultan and Alla ad Deen ate by themselves, while
the grand vizier and the great lords of the court, according to
their dignity and rank, sat at different tables. The conversation
turned on different subjects; but all the while the sultan took
so much pleasure in looking at his intended son-in-law, that he
hardly ever took his eyes off him; and throughout the whole of
their conversation Alla ad Deen showed so much good sense, as
confirmed the sultan in the high opinion he had formed of him.</p>

<p id="id02991">After the feast, the sultan sent for the chief judge of his
capital, and ordered him to draw up immediately a contract of
marriage between the princess Buddir al Buddoor his daughter and
Alla ad Deen. In the mean time the sultan and he entered into
another conversation on various subjects, in the presence of the
grand vizier and the lords of the court, who all admired the
solidity of his wit, the great ease and freedom wherewith he
delivered himself, the justness of his remarks, and his energy in
expressing them.</p>

<p id="id02992">When the judge had drawn up the contract in all the requisite
forms, the sultan asked Alla ad Deen if he would stay in the
palace, and solemnize the ceremonies of marriage that day. To
which he answered, "Sir, though great is my impatience to enjoy
your majesty's goodness, yet I beg of you to give me leave to
defer it till I have built a palace fit to receive the princess;
therefore I petition you to grant me a convenient spot of ground
near your palace, that I may the more frequently pay my respects,
and I will take care to have it finished with all diligence."
"Son," said the sultan, "take what ground you think proper, there
is space enough on every quarter round my palace; but consider, I
cannot see you too soon united with my daughter, which alone is
wanting to complete my happiness." After these words he embraced
Alla ad Deen again, who took his leave with as much politeness as
if he had been bred up and had always lived at court.</p>

<p id="id02993">Alla ad Deen returned home in the order he had come, amidst the
acclamations of the people, who wished him all happiness and
prosperity. As soon as he dismounted, he retired to his own
chamber, took the lamp, and called the genie as before, who in
the usual manner made him a tender of his service. "Genie," said
Alla ad Deen, "I have every reason to commend your exactness in
executing hitherto punctually whatever I have demanded; but now
if you have any regard for the lamp your protector, you must
show, if possible, more zeal and diligence than ever. I would
have you build me, as soon as you can, a palace opposite, but at
a proper distance from the sultan's, fit to receive my spouse the
princess Buddir al Buddoor. I leave the choice of the materials
to you, that is to say, porphyry, jasper, agate, lapis lazuli, or
the finest marble of various colours, and also the architecture
of the building. But I expect that on the terraced roof of this
palace you will build me a large hall crowned with a dome, and
having four equal fronts; and that instead of layers of bricks,
the walls be formed of massive gold and silver, laid alternately;
that each front shall contain six windows, the lattices of all
which, except one, which must be left unfinished, shall be so
enriched in the most tasteful workmanship, with diamonds, rubies,
and emeralds, that they shall exceed every thing of the kind ever
seen in the world. I would have an inner and outer court in front
of the palace, and a spacious garden; but above all things, take
care that there be laid in a place which you shall point out to
me a treasure of gold and silver coin. Besides, the edifice must
be well provided with kitchens and offices, storehouses, and
rooms to keep choice furniture in, for every season of the year.
I must have stables full of the finest horses, with their
equerries and grooms, and hunting equipage. There must be
officers to attend the kitchens and offices, and women slaves to
wait on the princess. You understand what I mean; therefore go
about it, and come and tell me when all is finished."</p>

<p id="id02994">By the time Alla ad Deen had instructed the genie resetting the
building of his palace, the sun was set. The next morning, before
break of day, our bridegroom, whose love for the princess would
not let him sleep, was up, when the genie presented himself, and
said, "Sir, your palace is finished, come and see how you like
it." Alla ad Deen had no sooner signified his consent, than the
genie transported him thither in an instant, and he found it so
much beyond his expectation, that he could not enough admire it.
The genie led him through all the apartments, where he met with
nothing but what was rich and magnificent, with officers and
slaves, all habited according to their rank and the services to
which they were appointed. The genie then showed him the
treasury, which was opened by a treasurer, where Alla ad Deen saw
heaps of purses, of different sizes, piled up to the top of the
ceiling, and disposed in most excellent order. The genie assured
him of the treasurer's fidelity, and thence led him to the
stables, where he showed him some of the finest horses in the
world, and the grooms busy in dressing them; from thence they
went to the store-houses, which were filled with all things
necessary, both for food and ornament.</p>

<p id="id02995">When Alla ad Deen had examined the palace from top to bottom, and
particularly the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, and found
it much beyond whatever he could have imagined, he said, "Genie,
no one can be better satisfied than I am; and indeed I should be
much to blame if I found any fault. There is only one thing
wanting which I forgot to mention; that is, to lay from the
sultan's palace to the door of the apartment designed for the
princess, a carpet of fine velvet for her to walk upon." The
genie immediately disappeared, and Alla ad Deen saw what he
desired executed in an instant. The genie then returned, and
carried him home before the gates of the sultan's palace were
opened.</p>

<p id="id02996">When the porters, who had always been used to an open prospect,
came to open the gates, they were amazed to find it obstructed,
and to see a carpet of velvet spread from the grand entrance.
They did not immediately look how far it extended; but when they
could discern Alla ad Deen's palace distinctly, their surprise
was increased. The news of so extraordinary a wonder was
presently spread through the palace. The grand vizier, who
arrived soon after the gates were open, being no less amazed than
others at this novelty, ran and acquainted the sultan, but
endeavoured to make him believe it to be all enchantment.
"Vizier," replied the sultan, "why will you have it to be
enchantment? You know as well as I that it must be Alla ad Deen's
palace, which I gave him leave to build, for the reception of my
daughter. After the proof we have had of his riches, can we think
it strange, that he should raise a palace in so short a time? He
wished to surprise us, and let us see what wonders are to be done
with money in only one night. Confess sincerely that the
enchantment you talk of proceeds from a little envy on account of
your son's disappointment." The hour of going to council put an
end to the conversation.</p>

<p id="id02997">When Alla ad Deen had been conveyed home, and had dismissed the
genie, he found his mother up, and dressing herself in one of
those suits which had been brought her. By the time the sultan
rose from the council, Alla ad Deen had prepared his mother to go
to the palace with her slaves, and desired her, if she saw the
sultan, to tell him she should do herself the honour to attend
the princess towards evening to her palace. Accordingly she went;
but though she and the women slaves who followed her were all
dressed like sultanesses, yet the crowd was not near so great as
the preceding day, because they were all veiled, and had each an
upper garment on agreeable to the richness and magnificence of
their habits. Alla ad Deen mounted his horse, and took leave of
his paternal house forever, taking care not to forget his
wonderful lamp, by the assistance of which he had reaped such
advantages, and arrived at the utmost height of his wishes, and
went to the palace in the same pomp as the day before.</p>

<p id="id02998">As soon as the porters of the sultan's palace saw Alla ad Deen's
mother, they went and informed the sultan, who immediately
ordered the bands of trumpets, cymbals, drums, fifes and
hautboys, placed in different parts of the palace, to play, so
that the air resounded with concerts which inspired the whole
city with joy: the merchants began to adorn their shops and
houses with fine carpets and silks, and to prepare illuminations
against night. The artisans of every description left their work,
and the populace repaired to the great space between the royal
palace and that of Alla ad Deen; which last drew all their
attention, not only because it was new to them, but because there
was no comparison between the two buildings. But their amazement
was to comprehend by what unheard-of miracle so magnificent a
palace could have been so soon erected, it being apparent to all
that there were no prepared materials, or any foundations laid
the day before.</p>

<p id="id02999">Alla ad Deen's mother was received in the palace with honour, and
introduced into the princess Buddir al Buddoor's apartment by the
chief of the eunuchs. As soon as the princess saw her, she rose,
saluted, and desired her to sit down on a sofa; and while her
women finished dressing and adorning her with the jewels which
Alla ad Deen had presented to her, a collation was served up. At
the same time the sultan, who wished to be as much with his
daughter as possible before he parted with her, came in and paid
the old lady great respect. Alla ad Deen's mother had talked to
the sultan in public, but he had never seen her with her veil
off, as she was then; and though she was somewhat advanced in
years, she had the remains of a good face, which showed what she
had been in her youth. The sultan, who had always seen her
dressed very meanly, not to say poorly, was surprised to find her
as richly and magnificently attired as the princess his daughter.
This made him think Alla ad Deen equally prudent and wise in
whatever he undertook.</p>

<p id="id03000">When it was night, the princess took her leave of the sultan her
father: their adieus were tender, and accompanied with tears.
They embraced each other several times, and at last the princess
left her own apartment for Alla ad Deen's palace, with his mother
on her left hand carried in a superb litter, followed by a
hundred women slaves, dressed with surprising magnificence. All
the bands of music, which had played from the time Alla ad Deen's
mother arrived, being joined together, led the procession,
followed by a hundred state ushers, and the like number of black
eunuchs, in two files, with their officers at their head. Four
hundred of the sultan's young pages carried flambeaux on each
side, which, together with the illuminations of the sultan's and
Alla ad Deen's palaces, made it as light as day.</p>

<p id="id03001">In this order the princess proceeded in her litter on the carpet,
which was spread from the sultan's palace, preceded by bands of
musicians, who, as they advanced, joining with those on the
terraces of Alla ad Deen's palace, formed a concert, which
increased the joyful sensations not only of the crowd assembled
in the great square, but of the metropolis and its environs.</p>

<p id="id03002">At length the princess arrived at the new palace. Alla ad Deen
ran with all imaginable joy to receive her at the grand entrance.
His mother had taken care to point him out to the princess, in
the midst of the officers who surrounded him, and she was charmed
with his person. "Adorable princess," said Alla ad Deen,
accosting her, and saluting her respectfully, as soon as she had
entered her apartment, "if I have the misfortune to have
displeased you by my boldness in aspiring to the possession of so
lovely a princess, and my sultan's daughter, I must tell you,
that you ought to blame your bright eyes and charms, not me."
"Prince (as I may now call you)," answered the princess, "I am
obedient to the will of my father; and it is enough for me to
have seen you to tell you that I obey without reluctance."</p>

<p id="id03003">Alla ad Deen, charmed with so agreeable and satisfactory an
answer, would not keep the princess standing; but took her by the
hand, which he kissed with the greatest demonstration of joy, and
led her into a large hall, illuminated with an infinite number of
wax candles, where, by the care of the genie, a noble feast was
served up. The dishes were of massive gold, and contained the
most delicate viands. The vases, basins, and goblets, were gold
also, and of exquisite workmanship, and all the other ornaments
and embellishments of the hall were answerable to this display.
The princess, dazzled to see so much riches collected in one
place, said to Alla ad Deen, "I thought, prince, that nothing in
the world was so beautiful as the sultan my father's palace, but
the sight of this hall alone is sufficient to show I was
deceived."</p>

<p id="id03004">Alla ad Deen led the princess to the place appointed for her, and
as soon as she and his mother were seated, a band of the most
harmonious instruments, accompanied with the voices of beautiful
ladies, began a concert, which lasted without intermission to the
end of the repast. The princess was so charmed, that she declared
she had never heard anything like it in the sultan her father's
court; but she knew not that these musicians were fairies chosen
by the genie, the slave of the lamp.</p>

<p id="id03005">When the supper was ended, there entered a company of female
dancers, who performed, according to the custom of the country,
several figure dances, singing at the same time verses in praise
of the bride and bridegroom. About midnight Alla ad Deen's mother
conducted the bride to the nuptial apartment, and he soon after
retired.</p>

<p id="id03006">The next morning when Alla ad Deen left the bridal chamber, his
attendants presented themselves to dress him, and brought him
another habit as rich and magnificent as that worn the day
before. He then ordered one of the horses appointed for his use
to be got ready, mounted him, and went in the midst of a large
troop of slaves to the sultan's palace. The sultan received him
with the same honours as before, embraced him, placed him on the
throne near him, and ordered a collation. Alla ad Deen said, "I
beg your majesty will dispense with my eating with you to-day; I
came to entreat you to take a repast in the princess's palace,
attended by your grand vizier, and all the lords of your court."
The sultan consented with pleasure, rose up immediately, and,
preceded by the principal officers of his palace, and followed by
all the great lords of his court, accompanied Alla ad Deen.</p>

<p id="id03007">The nearer the sultan approached Alla ad Deen's palace, the more
he was struck with its beauty, but was much more amazed when he
entered it; and could not forbear breaking out into exclamations
of approbation. But when he came into the hall, and cast his eyes
on the windows, enriched with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, all
large perfect stones, he was so much surprised, that he remained
some time motionless. After he recovered himself, he said to his
vizier, "Is it possible that there should be such a stately
palace so near my own, and I be an utter stranger to it till
now?" "Sir," replied the grand vizier, "your majesty may remember
that the day before yesterday you gave Alla ad Deen, whom you
accepted for your son-in-law, leave to build a palace opposite
your own, and that very day at sunset there was no palace on this
spot, but yesterday I had the honour first to tell you that the
palace was built and finished." "I remember," replied the sultan,
"but never imagined that the palace was one of the wonders of the
world; for where in all the world besides shall we find walls
built of massive gold and silver, instead of brick, stone, or
marble; and diamonds, rubies, and emeralds composing the
windows!"</p>

<p id="id03008">The sultan would examine and admire the beauty of all the windows, and
counting them, found that there were but three-and-twenty so richly
adorned, and he was greatly astonished that the twenty-fourth was left
imperfect. "Vizier," said he, for that minister made a point of never
leaving him, "I am surprised that a hall of this magnificence should
be left thus imperfect." "Sir," replied the grand vizier, "without
doubt Alla ad Deen only wanted time to finish this window like the
rest; for it is not to be supposed but that he has sufficient jewels
for the purpose, or that he will not complete it the first
opportunity."</p>

<p id="id03009">Alla ad Deen, who had left the sultan to go and give some orders,
returned just as the vizier had finished his remark. "Son," said
the sultan to him, "this hall is the most worthy of admiration of
any in the world; there is only one thing that surprises me,
which is to find one of the windows unfinished. Is it from the
forgetfulness or negligence of the workmen, or want of time, that
they have not put the finishing stroke to so beautiful a piece of
architecture?" "Sir," answered Alla ad Deen, "it was for none of
these reasons that your majesty sees it in this state. The
omission was by design, it was by my orders that the workmen left
it thus, since I wished that your majesty should have the glory
of finishing this hall, and of course the palace." "If you did it
with this intention," replied the sultan, "I take it kindly, and
will give orders about it immediately." He accordingly sent for
the most considerable jewellers and goldsmiths in his capital.</p>

<p id="id03010">Alla ad Deen then conducted the sultan into the saloon where he
had regaled his bride the preceding night. The princess entered
immediately afterwards, and received the sultan her father with
an air that showed how happy she was with her marriage. Two
tables were immediately spread with the most delicious meats, all
served up in gold dishes. The sultan, princess, Alla ad Deen, his
mother, and the grand vizier, sat down at the first, and all the
lords of the court at the second, which was very long. The sultan
was much pleased with the cookery, and owned he had never eaten
anything more excellent. He said the same of the wines, which
were delicious; but what he most of all admired, were four large
sideboards, profusely furnished with large flagons, basins, and
cups, all of massive gold, set with jewels. He was besides
charmed with several bands of music, which were ranged along the
hall, and formed most agreeable concerts.</p>

<p id="id03011">When the sultan rose from table, he was informed that the
jewellers and goldsmiths attended; upon which he returned to the
hall, and showed them the window which was unfinished. "I sent
for you," said he, "to fit up this window in as great perfection
as the rest; examine them well and make all the dispatch you
can."</p>

<p id="id03012">The jewellers and goldsmiths examined the three-and-twenty
windows with great attention, and after they had consulted
together, to know what each could furnish, they returned, and
presented themselves before the sultan, whose principal jeweller,
undertaking to speak for the rest, said, "Sir, we are all willing
to exert our utmost care and industry to obey your majesty; but
among us all we cannot furnish jewels enough for so great a
work." "I have more than are necessary," said the sultan; "come
to my palace, and you shall choose what may answer your purpose."</p>

<p id="id03013">When the sultan returned to his palace, he ordered his jewels to
be brought out, and the jewellers took a great quantity,
particularly those Alla ad Deen had made him a present of, which
they soon used, without making any greet advance in their work.
They came again several times for more, and in a month's time had
not finished half their work. In short, they used all the jewels
the sultan had, and borrowed of the vizier, but yet the work was
not half done.</p>

<p id="id03014">Alla ad Deen, who knew that all the sultan's endeavours to make
this window like the rest were in vain, sent for the jewellers
and goldsmiths, and not only commanded them to desist from their
work, but ordered them to undo what they had begun, and to carry
all their jewels back to the sultan and to the vizier. They undid
in a few hours what they had been six weeks about, and retired,
leaving Alla ad Deen alone in the hall. He took the lamp which he
carried about him, rubbed it, and presently the genie appeared.
"Genie," said Alla ad Deen, "I ordered thee to leave one of the
four-and-twenty windows of this hall imperfect, and thus hast
executed my commands punctually; now I would have thee make it
like the rest." The genie immediately disappeared. Alla ad Deen
went out of the hall, and returning soon after, found the window,
as he wished it to be, like the others.</p>

<p id="id03015">In the meantime, the jewellers and goldsmiths repaired to the palace,
and were introduced into the sultan's presence; where the chief
jeweller, presenting the precious stones which he had brought back,
said, in the name of all the rest, "Your majesty knows how long we
have been upon the work you were pleased to set us about, in which we
used all imaginable industry. It was far advanced, when prince Alla ad
Deen commanded us not only to leave off, but to undo what we had
already begun, and bring your majesty your jewels back." The sultan
asked them if Alla ad Deen had given them any reason for so doing, and
they answering that he had given them none, he ordered a horse to be
brought, which he mounted, and rode to his son-in law's palace, with
some few attendants on foot. When he came there, he alighted at the
stair-case, which led up to the hall with the twenty-four windows, and
went directly up to it, without giving previous notice to Alla ad
Deen; but it happened that at that very juncture Alla ad Deen was
opportunely there, and had just time to receive him at the door.</p>

<p id="id03016">The sultan, without giving Alla ad Deen time to complain
obligingly of his not having given notice, that he might have
acquitted himself with the more becoming respect, said to him,
"Son, I come myself to know the reason why you commanded the
jewellers to desist from work, and take to pieces what they had
done."</p>

<p id="id03017">Alla ad Deen disguised the true reason, which was, that the
sultan was not rich enough in jewels to be at so great an
expense, but said, "I beg of you now to see if any thing is
wanting."</p>

<p id="id03018">The sultan went directly to the window which was left imperfect,
and when he found it like the rest, fancied that he was mistaken,
examined the two windows on each side, and afterwards all the
four-and-twenty; but when he was convinced that the window which
several workmen had been so long about was finished in so short a
time, he embraced Alla ad Deen, and kissed him between his eyes.
"My son," said he, "what a man you are to do such surprising
things always in the twinkling of an eye; there is not your
fellow in the world; the more I know, the more I admire you."</p>

<p id="id03019">Alla ad Deen received these praises from the sultan with modesty,
and replied in these words: "Sir, it is a great honour to me to
deserve your majesty's good-will and approbation, and I assure
you, I shall study to deserve them more."</p>

<p id="id03020">The sultan returned to his palace, but would not let Alla ad Deen
attend him. When he came there, he found his grand vizier
waiting, to whom he related the wonder he had witnessed, with the
utmost admiration, and in such terms as left the minister no room
to doubt but that the facet was as the sultan related it; though
he was the more confirmed in his belief, that Alla ad Deen's
palace was the effect of enchantment, as he had told the sultan
the first moment he saw it. He was going to repeat the
observation, but the sultan interrupted him, and said, "You told
me so once before; I see, vizier, you have not forgotten your
son's espousals to my daughter." The frank vizier plainly saw how
much the sultan was prepossessed, therefore avoided disputes and
let him remain in his own opinion. The sultan as soon as he rose
every morning went into the closet, to look at Alla ad Deen's
palace, and would go many times in a day to contemplate and
admire it.</p>

<p id="id03021">Alla ad Deen did not confine himself in his palace; but took care
to shew himself once or twice a week in the town, by going
sometimes to one mosque, and sometimes to another, to prayers, or
to visit the grand vizier, who affected to pay his court to him
on certain days, or to do the principal lords of the court the
honour to return their visits after he had regaled them at his
palace. Every time he went out, he caused two slaves, who walked
by the side of his horse, to throw handfuls of money among the
people as he passed through the streets and squares, which were
generally on those occasions crowded. Besides, no one came to his
palace gates to ask alms, but returned satisfied with his
liberality. In short, he so divided his time, that not a week
passed but he went either once or twice a hunting, sometimes in
the environs of the city, sometimes farther off; at which time
the villages through which he passed felt the effects of his
generosity, which gained him the love and blessings of the
people: and it was common for them to swear by his head. Thus,
without giving the least umbrage to the sultan, to whom he paid
all imaginable respect, Alla ad Deen, by his affable behaviour
and liberality, had won the affections of the people, and was
more beloved than the sultan himself. With all these good
qualities he shewed a courage and a zeal for the public good
which could not be sufficiently applauded. He gave sufficient
proofs of both in a revolt on the borders of the kingdom; for he
no sooner understood that the sultan was levying an army to
disperse the rebels than he begged the command of it, which he
found not difficult to obtain. As soon as he was empowered, he
marched with so much expedition, that the sultan heard of the
defeat of the rebels before he had received an account of his
arrival in the army. And though this action rendered his name
famous throughout the kingdom, it made no alteration in his
disposition; but he was as affable after his victory as before.</p>

<p id="id03022">Alla ad Deen had conducted himself in this manner several years,
when the African magician, who undesignedly had been the
instrument of raising him to so high a pitch of prosperity,
recalled him to his recollection in Africa, whither, after his
expedition, he had returned. And though he was almost persuaded
that Alla ad Deen must have died miserably in the subterraneous
abode where he had left him, yet he had the curiosity to inform
himself about his end with certainty; and as he was a great
geomancer, he took out of a cupboard a square covered box, which
he used in his geomantic observations: then sat himself down on
the sofa, set it before him, and uncovered it. After he had
prepared and levelled the sand which was in it, with an intention
to discover whether or no Alla ad Deen had died in the
subterraneous abode, he cast the points, drew the figures, and
formed a horoscope, by which, when he came to examine it, he
found that Alla ad Deen, instead of dying in the cave, had made
his escape, lived splendidly, was in possession of the wonderful
lamp, had married a princess, and was much honoured and
respected.</p>

<p id="id03023">The magician no sooner understood by the rules of his diabolical
art, that Alla ad Deen had arrived to this height of good
fortune, than his face became inflamed with anger, and he cried
out in a rage, "This sorry tailor's son has discovered the secret
and virtue of the lamp! I believed his death to be certain; but
find that he enjoys the fruit of my labour and study! I will,
however, prevent his enjoying it long, or perish in the attempt."
He was not a great while deliberating on what he should do, but
the next morning mounted a barb, set forwards, and never stopped
but to refresh himself and horse, till he arrived at the capital
of China. He alighted, took up his lodging in a khan, and stayed
there the remainder of the day and the night, to refresh himself
after so long a journey.</p>

<p id="id03024">The next day, his first object was to inquire what people said of
Alla ad Deen; and, taking a walk through the town, he went to the
most public and frequented places, where persons of the best
distinction met to drink a certain warm liquor, which he had
drunk often during his former visit.</p>

<p id="id03025">As soon as he had seated himself, he was presented with a cup of
it, which he took; but listening at the same time to the
discourse of the company on each side of him, he heard them
talking of Alla ad Deen's palace. When he had drunk off his
liquor, he joined them, and taking this opportunity, inquired
particularly of what palace they spoke with so much commendation.
"From whence come you?" said the person to whom he addressed
himself; "you must certainly be a stranger not to have seen or
heard talk of Prince Alla ad Deen's palace" (for he was called so
after his marriage with the princess). "I do not say," continued
the man, "that it is one of the wonders of the world, but that it
is the only wonder of the world; since nothing so grand, rich,
and magnificent was ever beheld. Certainly you must have come
from a great distance, or some obscure corner, not to have heard
of it, for it must have been talked of all over the world. Go and
see it, and then judge whether I have told you more than the
truth." "Forgive my ignorance," replied the African magician; "I
arrived here but yesterday, and came from the farthest part of
Africa, where the fame of this palace had not reached when I came
away. The business which brought me hither was so urgent, that my
sole objets was to arrive as soon as I could, without stopping
anywhere, or making any acquaintance. But I will not fail to go
and see it; my impatience is so great, I will go immediately and
satisfy my curiosity, if you will do me the favour to shew me the
way thither."</p>

<p id="id03026">The person to whom the African magician addressed himself took a
pleasure in shewing him the way to Alla ad Deen's palace, and he
got up and went thither instantly. When he came to the palace,
and had examined it on all sides, he doubted not but that Alla ad
Deen had made use of the lamp to build it. Without attending to
the inability of a poor tailor's son, he knew that none but the
genii, the slaves of the lamp, the attaining of which he had
missed, could have performed such wonders; and piqued to the
quick at Alla ad Deen's happiness and splendour, he returned to
the khan where he lodged.</p>

<p id="id03027">The next point was to ascertain where the lamp was; whether Alla
ad Deen carried it about with him, or where he kept it; and this
he was to discover by an operation of geomancy. As soon as he
entered his lodging, he took his square box of sand, which he
always carried with him when he travelled, and after he had
performed some operations, he found that the lamp was in Alla ad
Deen's palace, and so great was his joy at the discovery that he
could hardly contain himself. "Well," said he, "I shall have the
lamp, and defy Alla ad Deen's preventing my carrying it off, and
making him sink to his original meanness, from which he has taken
so high a flight."</p>

<p id="id03028">It was Alla ad Deen's misfortune at that time to be absent in the
chase for eight days, and only three were expired, which the
magician came to know by this means. After he had performed the
magical operation, which gave him so much joy, he went to the
superintendent of the khan, entered into conversation with him on
indifferent subjects, and among the rest, told him he had been to
see Alla ad Deen's palace; and after exaggerating on all that he
had seen most worthy of observation, added, "But my curiosity
leads me farther, and I shall not be satisfied till I have seen
the person to whom this wonderful edifice belongs." "That will be
no difficult matter," replied the master of the khan, "there is
not a day passes but he gives an opportunity when he is in town,
but at present he is not at the palace, and has been gone these
three days on a hunting-match, which will last eight."</p>

<p id="id03029">The magician wanted to know no more; he took his leave of the
superintendent of the khan, and returning to his own chamber,
said to himself, "This is an opportunity I ought by no means to
neglect, but must make the best use of it." To that end, he went
to a coppersmith, and asked for a dozen copper lamps: the master
of the shop told him he had not so many by him, but if he would
have patience till the next day, he would have them ready. The
magician appointed his time, and desired him to take care that
they should be handsome and well polished. After promising to pay
him well, he returned to his inn.</p>

<p id="id03030">The next day the magician called for the twelve lamps, paid the
man his full price, put them into a basket which he bought on
purpose, and with the basket hanging on his arm, went directly to
Alla ad Deen's palace: as he approached he began crying, "Who
will change old lamps for new ones?" As he went along, a crowd of
children collected, who hooted, and thought him, as did all who
chanced to be passing by, a madman or a fool, to offer to change
new lamps for old ones.</p>

<p id="id03031">The African magician regarded not their scoffs, hootings, or all
they could say to him, but still continued crying, "Who will
change old lamps for new?" He repeated this so often, walking
backwards and forwards in front of the palace, that the princess,
who was then in the hall with the four-and-twenty windows,
hearing a man cry something, and not being able to distinguish
his words, owing to the hooting of the children and increasing
mob about him, sent one of her women slaves to know what he
cried.</p>

<p id="id03032">The slave was not long before she returned, and ran into the
hall, laughing so heartily, that the princess could not forbear
herself. "Well, giggler," said the princess, "will you tell me
what you laugh at?" "Madam," answered the slave, laughing still,
"who can forbear laughing, to see a fool with a basket on his
arm, full of fine new lamps, ask to change them for old ones; the
children and mob, crowding about him so that he can hardly stir,
make all the noise they can in derision of him."</p>

<p id="id03033">Another female slave hearing this, said, "Now you speak of lamps,
I know not whether the princess may have observed it, but there
is an old one upon a shelf of the prince's robing-room, and
whoever owns it will not be sorry to find a new one in its stead.
If the princess chooses, she may have the pleasure of trying if
this fool is so silly as to give a new lamp for an old one,
without taking any thing for the exchange."</p>

<p id="id03034">The lamp this slave spoke of was the wonderful lamp, which Alla
ad Deen had laid upon the shelf before he departed for the chase;
this he had done several times before; but neither the princess,
the slaves, nor the eunuchs, had ever taken notice of it. At all
other times except when hunting he carried it about his person.</p>

<p id="id03035">The princess, who knew not the value of this lamp, and the
interest that Alla ad Deen, not to mention herself, had to keep
it safe, entered into the pleasantry, and commanded a eunuch to
take it, and make the exchange. The eunuch obeyed, went out of
the hall, and no sooner got to the palace gates than he saw the
African magician, called to him, and shewing him the old lamp,
said, "Give me a new lamp for this."</p>

<p id="id03036">The magician never doubted but this was the lamp he wanted. There
could be no other such in this palace, where every utensil was
gold or silver. He snatched it eagerly out of the eunuch's hand,
and thrusting it as far as he could into his breast, offered him
his basket, and bade him choose which he liked best. The eunuch
picked out one, and carried it to the princess; but the exchange
was no sooner made than the place rung with the shouts of the
children, deriding the magician's folly.</p>

<p id="id03037">The African magician gave everybody leave to laugh as much as
they pleased; he stayed not long near the palace, but made the
best of his way, without crying any longer, "New lamps for old
ones." His end was answered, and by his silence he got rid of the
children and the mob.</p>

<p id="id03038">As soon as he was out of the square between the two palaces, he
hastened down the streets which were the least frequented; and
having no more occasion for his lamps or basket, set all down in
an alley where nobody saw him: then going down another street or
two, he walked till he came to one of the city gates, and
pursuing his way through the suburbs, which were very extensive,
at length reached a lonely spot, where he stopped for a time to
execute the design he had in contemplation, never caring for his
horse which he had left at the khan, but thinking himself
perfectly compensated by the treasure he had acquired.</p>

<p id="id03039">In this place the African magician passed the remainder of the
day, till the darkest time of night, when he pulled the lamp out
of his breast and rubbed it. At that summons the genie appeared,
and said, "What wouldst thou have? I am ready to obey thee as thy
slave, and the slave of all those who have that lamp in their
hands; both I and the other slaves of the lamp." "I command
thee," replied the magician, "to transport me immediately and the
palace which thou and the other slaves of the lamp have built in
this city, with all the people in it, to Africa." The genie made
no reply, but with the assistance of the other genii, the slaves
of the lamp immediately transported him and the palace entire, to
the spot whither he was desired to convey it.</p>

<p id="id03040">As soon as the sultan rose the next morning, according to custom,
he went into his closet, to have the pleasure of contemplating
and admiring Alla ad Deen's palace; but when he first looked that
way, and instead of a palace saw an empty space such as it was
before the palace was built, he thought he was mistaken, and
rubbed his eyes; but when he looked again, he still saw nothing
more the second time than the first, though the weather was fine,
the sky clear, and the dawn advancing had made all objects very
distinct. He looked again in front, to the right and left, but
beheld nothing more than he had formerly been used to see from
his window. His amazement was so great, that he stood for some
time turning his eyes to the spot where the palace had stood, but
where it was no longer to be seen. He could not comprehend how so
large a palace as Alla ad Deen's, which he had seen plainly every
day for some years, and but the day before, should vanish so
soon, and not leave the least remains behind. "Certainly," said
he to himself, "I am not mistaken; it stood there: if it had
fallen, the materials would have lain in heaps; and if it had
been swallowed up by an earthquake, there would be some mark
left." At last, though he was convinced that no palace stood now
opposite his own, he could not help staying some time at his
window, to see whether he might not be mistaken. At last he
retired to his apartment, not without looking behind him before
he quitted the spot ordered the grand vizier to be sent for with
expedition, and in the meantime sat down, his mind agitated by so
many different conjectures that he knew not what to resolve.</p>

<p id="id03041">The grand vizier did not make the sultan wait long for him, but
came with so much precipitation, that neither he nor his
attendants, as they passed, missed Alla ad Deen's palace; neither
did the porters, when they opened the palace gates observe any
alteration.</p>

<p id="id03042">When he came into the sultan's presence, he said to him, "the
haste in which your majesty sent for me makes me believe
something extraordinary has happened, since you know that this is
a day of public audience, and I should not have failed of
attending at the usual time." "Indeed," said the sultan, "it is
something very extraordinary, as you say, and you will allow it
to be so: tell me what is become of Alla ad Deen's palace?" "His
palace!" replied the grand vizier, in amazement, "I thought as I
passed it stood in its usual place; such substantial buildings
are not so easily removed." "Go into my closet," said the sultan,
"and tell me if you can see it."</p>

<p id="id03043">The grand vizier went into the closet, where he was struck with
no less amazement than the sultan had been. When he was well
assured that there was not the least appearance of this palace,
he returned to the sultan. "Well," said the sultan, "have you
seen Alla ad Deen's palace?" "No," answered the vizier; "but your
majesty may remember that I had the honour to tell you, that
palace, which was the subject of your admiration, with all its
immense riches, was only the work of magic and a magician; but
your majesty would not pay the least attention to what I said."</p>

<p id="id03044">The sultan, who could not deny what the grand vizier had
represented to him, flew into the greater passion: "Where is that
impostor, that wicked wretch," said he, "that I may have his head
taken off immediately?" "Sir," replied the grand vizier, "it is
some days since he came to take his leave of your majesty, on
pretence of hunting; he ought to be sent for, to know what is
become of his palace, since he cannot be ignorant of what has
been transacted." "That is too great an indulgence," replied the
sultan: "command a detachment of horse to bring him to me loaded
with chains." The grand vizier gave orders for a detachment, and
instructed the officer who commanded them how they were to act,
that Alla ad Deen might not escape. The detachment pursued their
orders; and about five or six leagues from the town met him
returning from the chase. The officer advanced respectfully, and
informed him the sultan was so impatient to see him, that he had
sent his party to accompany him home.</p>

<p id="id03045">Alla ad Deen had not the least suspicion of the true reason of
their meeting him; but when he came within half a league of the
city, the detachment surrounded him, when the officer addressed
himself to him, and said, "Prince, it is with great regret that I
declare to you the sultan's order to arrest you, and to carry you
before him as a criminal: I beg of you not to take it ill that we
acquit ourselves of our duty, and to forgive us."</p>

<p id="id03046">Alla ad Deen, who felt himself innocent, was much surprised at
this declaration, and asked the officer if he knew what crime he
was accused of; who replied, he did not. Then Alla ad Deen,
finding that his retinue was much interior to this detachment,
alighted off his horse, and said to the officers, "Execute your
orders; I am not conscious that I have committed any offence
against the sultan's person or government." A heavy chain was
immediately put about his neck, and fastened round his body, so
that both his arms were pinioned down; the officer then put
himself at the head of the detachment, and one of the troopers
taking hold of the end of the chain and proceeding after the
officer, led Alla ad Deen, who was obliged to follow him on foot,
into the city.</p>

<p id="id03047">When this detachment entered the suburbs, the people, who saw
Alla ad Deen thus led as a state criminal, never doubted but that
his head was to be cut off; and as he was generally beloved, some
took sabres and other arms; and those who had none gathered
stones, and followed the escort. The last division faced about to
disperse them; but their numbers presently increased so much,
that the soldiery began to think it would be well if they could
get into the sultan's palace before Alla ad Deen was rescued; to
prevent which, according to the different extent of the streets,
they took care to cover the ground by extending or closing. In
this manner they with much difficulty arrived at the palace
square, and there drew up in a line, till their officer and
troopers with Alla ad Deen had got within the gates, which were
immediately shut.</p>

<p id="id03048">Alla ad Deen was carried before the sultan, who waited for him,
attended by the grand vizier, in a balcony; and as soon as he saw
him, he ordered the executioner, who waited there for the
purpose, to strike off his head without hearing him or giving him
leave to clear himself.</p>

<p id="id03049">As soon as the executioner had taken off the chain that was
fastened about Alla ad Deen's neck and body, and laid down a skin
stained with the blood of the many he had executed, he made the
supposed criminal kneel down, and tied a bandage over his eyes.
Then drawing his sabre, took his aim by flourishing it three
times in the air, waiting for the sultan's giving the signal to
strike.</p>

<p id="id03050">At that instant the grand vizier perceiving that the populace had
forced the guard of horse, crowded the great square before the
palace, and were scaling the walls in several places, and
beginning to pull them down to force their way in; he said to the
sultan, before he gave the signal, "I beg of your majesty to
consider what you are going to do, since you will hazard your
palace being destroyed; and who knows what fatal consequence may
follow?" "My palace forced!" replied the sultan; "who can have
that audacity?" "Sir," answered the grand vizier, "if your
majesty will but cast your eyes towards the great square, and on
the palace walls, you will perceive the truth of what I say."</p>

<p id="id03051">The sultan was so much alarmed when he saw so great a crowd, and
how enraged they were, that he ordered the executioner to put his
sabre immediately into the scabbard, to unbind Alla ad Deen, and
at the same time commanded the porters to declare to the people
that the sultan had pardoned him, and that they might retire.</p>

<p id="id03052">Those who had already got upon the walls, and were witnesses of
what had passed, abandoned their design and got quickly down,
overjoyed that they had saved the life of a man they dearly
loved, and published the news amongst the rest, which was
presently confirmed by the mace-bearers from the top of the
terraces. The justice which the sultan had done to Alla ad Deen
soon disarmed the populace of their rage; the tumult abated, and
the mob dispersed.</p>

<p id="id03053">When Alla ad Deen found himself at liberty, he turned towards the
balcony, and perceiving the sultan, raised his voice, and said to
him in a moving manner, "I beg of your majesty to add one favour
more to that which I have already received, which is, to let me
know my crime?" "Your crime," answered the sultan; "perfidious
wretch! Do you not know it? Come hither, and I will shew it you."</p>

<p id="id03054">Alla ad Deen went up, when the sultan, going before him without
looking at him, said, "Follow me;" and then led him into his
closet. When he came to the door, he said, "Go in; you ought to
know whereabouts your palace stood: look round and tell me what
is become of it?"</p>

<p id="id03055">Alla ad Deen looked, but saw nothing. He perceived the spot upon
which his palace had stood; but not being able to divine how it
had disappeared, was thrown into such great confusion and
amazement, that he could not return one word of answer.</p>

<p id="id03056">The sultan growing impatient, demanded of him again, "Where is
your palace, and what is become of my daughter?" Alla ad Deen,
breaking silence, replied, "Sir, I perceive and own that the
palace which I have built is not in its place, but is vanished;
neither can I tell your majesty where it may be, but can assure
you I had no concern in its removal."</p>

<p id="id03057">"I am not so much concerned about your palace," replied the
sultan, "I value my daughter ten thousand times more, and would
have you find her out, otherwise I will cause your head to be
struck off, and no consideration shall divert me from my
purpose."</p>

<p id="id03058">"I beg of your majesty," answered Alla ad Deen, "to grant me
forty days to make my inquiries; and if in that time I have not
the success I wish, I will offer my head at the foot of your
throne, to be disposed of at your pleasure." "I give you the
forty days you ask," said the sultan; "but think not to abuse the
favour I shew you, by imagining you shall escape my resentment;
for I will find you out in whatsoever part of the world you may
conceal yourself."</p>

<p id="id03059">Alla ad Deen went out of the sultan's presence with great
humiliation, and in a condition worthy of pity. He crossed the
courts of the palace, hanging down his head, and in such great
confusion, that he durst not lift up his eyes. The principal
officers of the court, who had all professed themselves his
friends, and whom he had never disobliged, instead of going up to
him to comfort him, and offer him a retreat in their houses,
turned their backs to avoid seeing him. But had they accosted him
with a word of comfort or offer of service, they would have no
more known Alla ad Deen. He did not know himself, and was no
longer in his senses, as plainly appeared by his asking everybody
he met, and at every house, if they had seen his palace, or could
tell him any news of it.</p>

<p id="id03060">These questions made the generality believe that Alla ad Deen was
mad. Some laughed at him, but people of sense and humanity,
particularly those who had had any connection of business or
friendship with him, really pitied him. For three days he rambled
about the city in this manner, without coming to any resolution,
or eating anything but what some compassionate people forced him
to take out of charity.</p>

<p id="id03061">At last, as he could no longer in his unhappy condition stay in a
city where he had lately been next to the sultan, he took the
road to the country; and after he had traversed several fields in
wild uncertainty, at the approach of night came to the bank of a
river. There, possessed by his despair, he said to himself,
"Where shall I seek my palace? In what province, country, or part
of the world, shall I find that and my dear princess, whom the
sultan expects from me? I shall never succeed; I had better free
myself at once from fruitless endeavours, and such bitter grief
as preys upon me." He was just going to throw himself into the
river, but, as a good Moosulmaun, true to his religion, he
thought he should not do it without first saying his prayers.
Going to prepare himself, he went to the river's brink, in order
to perform the usual ablutions. The place being steep and
slippery, from the water beating against it, he slid down, and
had certainly fallen into the river, but for a little rock which
projected about two feet out of the earth. Happily also for him
he still had on the ring which the African magician had put on
his finger before he went down into the subterraneous abode to
fetch the precious lamp. In slipping down the bank he rubbed the
ring so hard by holding on the rock, that immediately the same
genie appeared whom he had seen in the cave where the magician
had left him. "What wouldst thou have?" said the genie. "I am
ready to obey thee as thy slave, and the slave of all those that
have that ring on their finger; both I and the other slaves of
the ring."</p>

<p id="id03062">Alla ad Deen, agreeably surprised at an apparition he so little
expected in his present calamity, replied, "Save my life, genie,
a second time, either by shewing me to the place where the palace
I caused to be built now stands, or immediately transporting it
back where it first stood." "What you command me," answered the
genie, "is not wholly in my power; I am only the slave of the
ring; you must address yourself to the slave of the lamp." "If
that be the case," replied Alla ad Deen, "I command thee, by the
power of the ring, to transport me to the spot where my palace
stands, in what part of the world soever it may be, and set me
down under the window of the princess Buddir al Buddoor." These
words were no sooner out of his mouth, than the genie transported
him into Africa, to the midst of a large plain, where his palace
stood, at no great distance from a city, and placing him exactly
under the window of the princess's apartment, left him. All this
was done almost in an instant.</p>

<p id="id03063">Alla ad Deen, notwithstanding the darkness of the night, knew his
palace and the princess Buddir al Buddoor's apartment again; but
as the night was far advanced, and all was quiet in the palace,
he retired to some distance, and sat down at the foot of a large
tree. There, full of hopes, and reflecting on his happiness, for
which he was indebted to chance, he found himself in a much more
comfortable situation than when he was arrested and carried
before the sultan; being now delivered from the immediate danger
of losing his life. He amused himself for some time with these
agreeable thoughts; but not having slept for two days, was not
able to resist the drowsiness which came upon him, but fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p id="id03064">The next morning, as soon as day appeared, Alla ad Deen was
agreeably awakened by the singing not only of the birds which had
roosted in the tree under which he had passed the night, but also
of those which frequented the thick groves of the palace garden.
When he cast his eyes on that wonderful edifice, he felt
inexpressible joy at thinking he might possibly soon be master of
it again, and once more possess his dear princess Buddir al
Buddoor. Pleased with these hopes, he immediately arose, went
towards the princess's apartment, and walked some time under her
window in expectation of her rising, that he might see her.
During this expectation, he began to consider with himself whence
the cause of his misfortune had proceeded; and after mature
reflection, no longer doubted that it was owing to having trusted
the lamp out of his sight. He accused himself of negligence in
letting it be a moment away from him. But what puzzled him most
was, that he could not imagine who had been so envious of his
happiness. He would soon have guessed this, if he had known that
both he and his palace were in Africa, the very name of which
would soon have made him remember the magician his declared
enemy; but the genie, the slave of the ring, had not made the
least mention of the name of the country, nor had Alla ad Deen
inquired.</p>

<p id="id03065">The princess rose earlier that morning than she had done since
her transportation into Africa by the magician, whose presence
she was forced to support once a day, because he was master of
the palace; but she had always treated him so harshly that he
dared not reside in it. As she was dressing, one of the women
looking through the window, perceived Alla ad Deen, and instantly
told her mistress. The princess, who could not believe the joyful
tidings, hastened herself to the window, and seeing Alla ad Deen,
immediately opened it. The noise of opening the window made Alla
ad Deen turn his head that way, and perceiving the princess he
saluted her with an air that expressed his joy. "To lose no
time," said she to him, "I have sent to have the private door
opened for you; enter, and come up."</p>

<p id="id03066">The private door, which was just under the princess's apartment,
was soon opened, and Alla ad Deen conducted up into the chamber.
It is impossible to express the joy of both at seeing each other,
after so cruel a separation. After embracing and shedding tears
of joy, they sat down, and Alla ad Deen said, "I beg of you,
princess, in God's name, before we talk of anything else, to tell
me, both for your own sake, the sultan your father's, and mine,
what is become of an old lamp which I left upon a shelf in my
robing-chamber, when I departed for the chase."</p>

<p id="id03067">"Alas! dear husband," answered the princess, "I was afraid our
misfortune might be owing to that lamp: and what grieves me most
is, that I have been the cause of it." "Princess," replied Alla
ad Deen, "do not blame yourself, since it was entirely my fault,
for I ought to have taken more care of it. But let us now think
only of repairing the loss; tell me what has happened, and into
whose hands it has fallen."</p>

<p id="id03068">The princess then related how she had changed the old lamp for a
new one, which she ordered to be fetched, that he might see it,
and how the next morning she found herself in the unknown country
they were then in, which she was told was Africa, by the traitor,
who had transported her thither by his magic art.</p>

<p id="id03069">"Princess," said Alla ad Deen, interrupting her, "you have
informed me who the traitor is, by telling me we are in Africa.
He is the most perfidious of men; but this is neither a time nor
place to give you a full account of his villainies. I desire you
only to tell me what he has done with the lamp, and where he has
put it?" "He carries it carefully wrapped up in his bosom," said
the princess; "and this I can assure you, because he pulled it
out before me, and shewed it to me in triumph."</p>

<p id="id03070">"Princess," said Alla ad Deen, "do not be displeased that I
trouble you with so many questions, since they are equally
important to us both. But to come to what most particularly
concerns me; tell me, I conjure you, how so wicked and perfidious
a man treats you?" "Since I have been here," replied the
princess, "he repairs once every day to see me; and I am
persuaded the little satisfaction he receives from his visits
makes him come no oftener. All his addresses tend to persuade me
to break that faith I have pledged to you, and to take him for my
husband; giving me to understand, I need not entertain hopes of
ever seeing you again, for that you were dead, having had your
head struck off by the sultan my father's order. He added, to
justify himself, that you were an ungrateful wretch; that your
good fortune was owing to him, and a great many other things of
that nature which I forbear to repeat: but as he received no
other answer from me but grievous complaints and tears, he was
always forced to retire with as little satisfaction as he came. I
doubt not his intention is to allow me time to overcome my grief,
in hopes that afterwards I may change my sentiments; and if I
persevere in an obstinate refusal, to use violence. But my dear
husband's presence removes all my apprehensions."</p>

<p id="id03071">"I am confident my attempts to punish the magician will not be in
vain," replied Alla ad Deen, "since my princess's fears are
removed, and I think I have found the means to deliver you from
both your enemy and mine; to execute this design, it is necessary
for me to go to the town. I shall return by noon, will then
communicate my design, and what must be done by you to ensure
success. But that you may not be surprised, I think it proper to
acquaint you, that I shall change my apparel, and beg of you to
give orders that I may not wait long at the private door, but
that it may be opened at the first knock;" all which the princess
promised to observe.</p>

<p id="id03072">When Alla ad Deen was out of the palace, he looked round him on
all sides, and perceiving a peasant going into the country,
hastened after him; and when he had overtaken him, made a
proposal to him to change habits, which the man agreed to. When
they had made the exchange, the countryman went about his
business, and Alla ad Deen to the city. After traversing several
streets, he came to that part of the town where all descriptions
of merchants and artisans had their particular streets, according
to their trades. He went into that of the druggists; and going
into one of the largest and best furnished shops, asked the
druggist if he had a certain powder which he named.</p>

<p id="id03073">The druggist, judging Alla ad Deen by his habit to be very poor,
and that he had not money enough to pay for it, told him he had
it, but that it was very dear; upon which Alla ad Deen penetrated
his thoughts, pulled out his purse, and shewing him some gold,
asked for half a dram of the powder; which the druggist weighed,
wrapped up in paper, and gave him, telling him the price was a
piece of gold. Alla ad Deen put the money into his hand, and
staying no longer in the town than just to get a little
refreshment, returned to the palace, where he waited not long at
the private door. When he came into the princess's apartment, he
said to her, "Princess, perhaps the aversion you tell me you have
for your ravisher may be an objection to your executing what I am
going to propose; but permit me to say it is proper that you
should at this juncture dissemble a little, and do violence to
your inclinations, if you would deliver yourself from him, and
give my lord the sultan your father the satisfaction of seeing
you again." "If you will take my advice," continued he, "dress
yourself this moment in one of your richest habits, and when the
African magician comes, make no difficulty to give him the best
reception; receive him with a cheerful countenance, so that he
may imagine time has removed your affliction and disgust at his
addresses. In your conversation, let him understand that you
strive to forget me; and that he may be the more fully convinced
of your sincerity, invite him to sup with you, and tell him you
should be glad to taste of some of the best wines of his country.
He will presently go to fetch you some. During his absence, put
into one of the cups you are accustomed to drink out of this
powder, and setting it by, charge the slave you may order that
night to attend you, on a signal you shall agree upon, to bring
that cup to you. When the magician and you have eaten and drunk
as much as you choose, let her bring you the cup, and then change
cups with him. He will esteem it so great a favour that he will
not refuse, but eagerly quaff it off; but no sooner will he have
drunk, than you will see him fall backwards. If you have any
reluctance to drink out of his cup, you may pretend only to do
it, without fear of being discovered; for the effect of the
powder is so quick, that he will not have time to know whether
you drink or not."</p>

<p id="id03074">When Alla ad Deen had finished, "I own," answered the princess,
"I shall do myself great violence in consenting to make the
magician such advances as I see are absolutely necessary; but
what cannot one resolve to do against a cruel enemy? I will
therefore follow your advice, since both my repose and yours
depend upon it." After the princess had agreed to the measures
proposed by Alla ad Deen, he took his leave, and went and spent
the rest of the day in the neighbourhood of the palace till it
was night, and he might safely return to the private door.</p>

<p id="id03075">The princess, who had remained inconsolable at being separated
not only from her husband, whom she had loved from the first
moment, and still continued to love more out of inclination than
duty, but also from the sultan her father, who had always showed
the most tender and paternal affection for her, had, ever since
their cruel separation, lived in great neglect of her person. She
had almost forgotten the neatness so becoming persons of her sex
and quality, particularly after the first time the magician paid
her a visit; and she had understood by some of the women, who
knew him again, that it was he who had taken the old lamp in
exchange for a new one, which rendered the sight of him more
abhorred. However, the opportunity of taking the revenge he
deserved made her resolve to gratify Alla ad Deen. As soon,
therefore, as he was gone, she sat down to dress, and was attired
by her women to the best advantage in the richest habit of her
wardrobe. Her girdle was of the finest and largest diamonds set
in gold, her necklace of pearls, six on a side, so well
proportioned to that in the middle, which was the largest ever
seen, and invaluable, that the greatest sultanesses would have
been proud to have been adorned with only two of the smallest.
Her bracelets, which were of diamonds and rubies intermixed,
corresponded admirably to the richness of the girdle and
necklace.</p>

<p id="id03076">When the princess Buddir al Buddoor was completely dressed, she
consulted her glass and women upon her adjustment; and when she
found she wanted no charms to flatter the foolish passion of the
African magician, she sat down on a sofa expecting his arrival.</p>

<p id="id03077">The magician came at the usual hour, and as soon as he entered
the great hall where the princess waited to receive him, she rose
with an enchanting grace and smile, and pointed with her hand to
the most honourable place, waiting till he sat down, that she
might sit at the same time which was a civility she had never
shown him before.</p>

<p id="id03078">The African magician, dazzled more with the lustre of the
princess's eyes than the glittering of the jewels with which she
was adorned, was much surprised. The smiling and graceful air
with which she received him, so opposite to her former behaviour,
quite fascinated his heart.</p>

<p id="id03079">When he was seated, the princess, to free him from his
embarrassment, broke silence first, locking at him all the time
in such a manner as to make him believe that he was not so odious
to her as she had given him to understand hitherto and said, "You
are doubtless amazed to find me so much altered to-day; but your
surprise will not be so great when I acquaint you, that I am
naturally of a disposition so opposite to melancholy and grief,
sorrow and uneasiness, that I always strive to put them as far
away as possible when I find the subject of them is past. I have
reflected on what you told me of Alla ad Deen's fate, and know my
father's temper so well, that I am persuaded with you he could
not escape the terrible effects of the sultan's rage; therefore,
should I continue to lament him all my life, my tears cannot
recall him. For this reason, since I have paid all the duties
decency requires of me to his memory, now he is in the grave I
think I ought to endeavour to comfort myself. These are the
motives of the change you see in me; I am resolved to banish
melancholy entirely; and, persuaded that you will bear me company
tonight, I have ordered a supper to be prepared; but as I have no
wines but those of China, I have a great desire to taste of the
produce of Africa, and doubt not your procuring some of the
best."</p>

<p id="id03080">The African magician, who had looked upon the happiness of
getting so soon and so easily into the princess Buddir al
Buddoor's good graces as impossible, could not think of words
expressive enough to testify how sensible he was of her favours:
but to put an end the sooner to a conversation which would have
embarrassed him, if he had engaged farther in it, he turned it
upon the wines of Africa, and said, "Of all the advantages Africa
can boast, that of producing the most excellent wines is one of
the principal. I have a vessel of seven years old, which has
never been broached; and it is indeed not praising it too much to
say it is the finest wine in the world. If my princess," added
he, "will give me leave, I will go and fetch two bottles, and
return again immediately." "I should be sorry to give you that
trouble," replied the princess; "you had better send for them."
"It is necessary I should go myself," answered the African
magician; "for nobody but myself knows where the key of the
cellar is laid, or has the secret to unlock the door." "If it be
so," said the princess, "make haste back; for the longer you
stay, the greater will be my impatience, and we shall sit down to
supper as soon as you return."</p>

<p id="id03081">The African magician, full of hopes of his expected happiness,
rather flew than ran, and returned quickly with the wine. The
princess, not doubting but he would make haste, put with her own
hand the powder Alla ad Deen had given her into the cup set apart
for that purpose. They sat down at the table opposite to each
other, the magician's back towards the sideboard. The princess
presented him with the best at the table, and said to him, "If
you please, I will entertain you with a concert of vocal and
instrumental music; but, as we are only two, I think conversation
maybe more agreeable." This the magician took as a new favour.</p>

<p id="id03082">After they had eaten some time, the princess called for some
wine, drank the magician's health, and afterwards said to him,
"Indeed you had a full right to commend your wine, since I never
tasted any so delicious." "Charming princess," said he, holding
in his hand the cup which had been presented to him, "my wine
becomes more exquisite by your approbation." "Then drink my
health," replied the princess; "you will find I understand
wines." He drank the princess's health, and returning the cup,
said, "I think myself fortunate, princess, that I reserved this
wine for so happy an occasion; and own I never before drank any
in every respect so excellent."</p>

<p id="id03083">When they had each drunk two or three cups more, the princess,
who had completely charmed the African magician by her civility
and obliging behaviour, gave the signal to the slave who served
them with wine, bidding her bring the cup which had been filled
for her, and at the same time bring the magician a full goblet.
When they both had their cups in their hands, she said to him, "I
know not how you express your loves in these parts when drinking
together? With us in China the lover and his mistress
reciprocally exchange cups, and drink each other's health." At
the same time she presented to him the cup which was in her hand,
and held out her hand to receive his. He hastened to make the
exchange with the more pleasure, because he looked upon this
favour as the most certain token of an entire conquest over the
princess, which raised his rapture to the highest pitch. Before
he drank, he said to her, with the cup in his hand, "Indeed,
princess, we Africans are not so refined in the art of love as
you Chinese: and your instructing me in a lesson I was ignorant
of, informs me how sensible I ought to be of the favour done me.
I shall never, lovely princess, forget my recovering, by drinking
out of your cup, that life, which your cruelty, had it continued,
must have made me despair of."</p>

<p id="id03084">The princess, who began to be tired with this impertinent
declaration of the African magician, interrupted him, and said,
"Let us drink first, and then say what you will afterwards;" at
the same time she set the cup to her lips, while the African
magician, who was eager to get his wine off first, drank up the
very last drop. In finishing it, he had reclined his head back to
shew his eagerness, and remained some time in that state. The
princess kept the cup at her lips, till she saw his eyes turn in
his head, when he fell backwards lifeless on the sofa.</p>

<p id="id03085">The princess had no occasion to order the private door to be
opened to Alla ad Deen; for her women were so disposed from the
great hall to the foot of the staircase, that the word was no
sooner given that the African magician was fallen backwards, than
the door was immediately opened.</p>

<p id="id03086">As soon as Alla ad Deen entered the hall, he saw the magician
stretched backwards on the sofa. The princess rose from her seat,
and ran overjoyed to embrace him; but he stopped her, and said,
"Princess, it is not yet time; oblige me by retiring to your
apartment; and let me be left alone a moment, while I endeavour
to transport you back to China as speedily as you were brought
from thence."</p>

<p id="id03087">When the princess, her women and eunuchs, were gone out of the
hall, Alla ad Deen shut the door, and going directly to the dead
body of the magician, opened his vest, took out the lamp, which
was carefully wrapped up, as the princess had told him, and
unfolding and rubbing it, the genie immediately appeared.
"Genie," said Alla ad Deen, "I have called to command thee, on
the part of thy good mistress this lamp, to transport this palace
instantly into China, to the place from whence it was brought
hither." The genie bowed his head in token of obedience, and
disappeared. Immediately the palace was transported into China,
and its removal was only felt by two little shocks, the one when
it was lifted up, the other when it was set down, and both in a
very short interval of time.</p>

<p id="id03088">Alla ad Deen went to the princess's apartment, and embracing her,
said, "I can assure you, princess, that your joy and mine will be
complete tomorrow morning." The princess, guessing that Alla ad
Deen must be hungry, ordered the dishes, served up in the great
hall, to be brought down. The princess and Alla ad Deen ate as
much as they thought fit, and drank of the African magician's old
wine; during which time their conversation could not be otherwise
than satisfactory, and then they retired to their own chamber.</p>

<p id="id03089">From the time of the transportation of Alla ad Deen's palace,
the princess's father had been inconsolable for the loss of her.
He could take no rest, and instead of avoiding what might
continue his affliction, he indulged it without restraint. Before
the disaster he used to go every morning into his closet to
please himself with viewing the palace, he went now many times in
the day to renew his tears, and plunge himself into the deepest
melancholy, by the idea of no more seeing that which once gave
him so much pleasure, and reflecting how he had lost what was
most dear to him in this world.</p>

<p id="id03090">The very morning of the return of Alla ad Deen's palace, the sultan
went, by break of day, into his closet to indulge his sorrows.
Absorbed in himself, and in a pensive mood, he cast his eyes towards
the spot, expecting only to see an open space; but perceiving the
vacancy filled up, he at first imagined the appearance to be the
effect of a fog; looking more attentively, he was convinced beyond the
power of doubt it was his son-in-law's palace. Joy and gladness
succeeded to sorrow and grief. He returned immediately into his
apartment, and ordered a horse to be saddled and brought to him
without delay, which he mounted that instant, thinking he could not
make haste enough to the palace.</p>

<p id="id03091">Alla ad Deen, who foresaw what would happen, rose that morning by
day-break, put on one of the most magnificent habits his wardrobe
afforded, and went up into the hall of twenty-four windows, from
whence he perceived the sultan approaching, and got down soon
enough to receive him at the foot of the great staircase, and to
help him to dismount. "Alla ad Deen," said the sultan, "I cannot
speak to you till I have seen and embraced my daughter."</p>

<p id="id03092">He led the sultan into the princess's apartment. The happy father
embraced her with his face bathed in tears of joy; and the
princess, on her side, shewed him all the testimonies of the
extreme pleasure the sight of him afforded her.</p>

<p id="id03093">The sultan was some time before he could open his lips, so great
was his surprise and joy to find his daughter again, after he had
given her up for lost; and the princess, upon seeing her father,
let fall tears of rapture and affection.</p>

<p id="id03094">At last the sultan broke silence, and said, "I would believe,
daughter, your joy to see me makes you seem as little changed as
if no misfortune had befallen you; yet I cannot be persuaded but
that you have suffered much alarm; for a large palace cannot be
so suddenly transported as yours has been, without causing great
fright and apprehension I would have you tell me all that has
happened, and conceal nothing from me."</p>

<p id="id03095">The princess, who took great pleasure in giving the sultan the
satisfaction he demanded, said, "If I appear so little altered, I
beg of your majesty to consider that I received new life
yesterday morning by the presence of my dear husband and
deliverer Alla ad Deen, whom I looked upon and bewailed as lost
to me; and the happiness of seeing and embracing of whom has
almost recovered me to my former state of health. My greatest
suffering was only to find myself forced from your majesty and my
dear husband; not only from the love I bore my husband, but from
the uneasiness I laboured under through fear that he, though
innocent, might feel the effects of your anger, to which I knew
he was left exposed. I suffered but little from the insolence of
the wretch who had carried me off; for having secured the
ascendant over him, I always put a stop to his disagreeable
overtures, and was as little constrained as I am at present.</p>

<p id="id03096">"As to what relates to my transportation, Alla ad Deen had no
concern in it; I was myself the innocent cause of it." To
persuade the sultan of the truth of what she said, she gave him a
full account of how the African magician had disguised himself,
and offered to change new lamps for old ones; how she had amused
herself in making that exchange, being entirely ignorant of the
secret and importance of the wonderful lamp; how the palace and
herself were carried away and transported into Africa, with the
African magician, who was recognised by two of her women and the
eunuch who made the exchange of the lamp, when he had the
audacity, after the success of his daring enterprise, to propose
himself for her husband; how he persecuted her till Alla ad
Deen's arrival; how they had concerted measures to get the lamp
from him again, and the success they had fortunately met with by
her dissimulation in inviting him to supper, and giving him the
cup with the powder prepared for him. "For the rest," added she,
"I leave it to Alla ad Deen to recount."</p>

<p id="id03097">Alla ad Deen had not much to tell the sultan, but only said,
"When the private door was opened I went up into the great hall,
where I found the magician lying dead on the sofa, and as I
thought it not proper for the princess to stay there any longer,
I desired her to go down into her own apartment, with her women
and eunuchs. As soon as I was alone, and had taken the lamp out
of the magician's breast, I made use of the same secret he had
done, to remove the palace, and carry off the princess; and by
that means the palace was re-conveyed to the place where it stood
before; and I have the happiness to restore the princess to your
majesty, as you commanded me. But that your majesty may not think
that I impose upon you, if you will give yourself the trouble to
go up into the hall, you may see the magician punished as he
deserved."</p>

<p id="id03098">The sultan, to be assured of the truth, rose instantly, and went
into the hall, where, when he saw the African magician dead, and
his face already livid by the strength of the poison, he embraced
Alla ad Deen with great tenderness, and said, "My son, be not
displeased at my proceedings against you; they arose from my
paternal love; and therefore you ought to forgive the excesses to
which it hurried me." "Sir," replied Alla ad Deen, "I have not
the least reason to complain of your majesty's conduct, since you
did nothing but what your duty required. This infamous magician,
the basest of men, was the sole cause of my misfortune. When your
majesty has leisure, I will give you an account of another
villanous action he was guilty of towards me, which was no less
black and base than this, from which I was preserved by the
providence of God in a very miraculous way." "I will take an
opportunity, and that very shortly," replied the sultan, "to hear
it; but in the mean time let us think only of rejoicing, and the
removal of this odious object."</p>

<p id="id03099">Alla ad Deen ordered the magician's corpse to be removed and
thrown upon a dunghill, for birds and beasts to prey upon. In the
mean time, the sultan commanded the drums, trumpets, cymbals, and
other instruments of music to announce his joy to the public, and
a festival of ten days to be proclaimed for the return of the
princess and Alla ad Deen.</p>

<p id="id03100">Thus Alla ad Deen escaped once more the almost inevitable danger
of losing his life; but this was not the last, since he ran as
great a hazard a third time.</p>

<p id="id03101">The African magician had a younger brother, who was equally
skilful as a necromancer, and even surpassed him in villany and
pernicious designs. As they did not live together, or in the same
city, but oftentimes when one was in the east, the other was in
the west, they failed not every year to inform themselves, by
their art, each where the other resided, and whether they stood
in need of one another's assistance.</p>

<p id="id03102">Some time after the African magician had failed in his enterprise
against Alla ad Deen, his younger brother, who had heard no
tidings of him, and was not in Africa, but in a distant country,
had the wish to know in what part of the world he sojourned, the
state of his health, and what he was doing; and as he, as well as
his brother, always carried a geomantic square instrument about
him, he prepared the sand, cast the points, and drew the figures.
On examining the planetary mansions, he found that his brother
was no longer living, but had been poisoned; and by another
observation, that he was in the capital of the kingdom of China;
also that the person who had poisoned him was of mean birth,
though married to a princess, a sultan's daughter.</p>

<p id="id03103">When the magician had informed himself of his brother's fate, he
lost no time in useless regret, which could not restore him to
life; but resolving immediately to revenge his death, departed
for China; where, after crossing plains, rivers, mountains,
deserts, and a long tract of country without delay, he arrived
after incredible fatigues.</p>

<p id="id03104">When he came to the capital of China, he took a lodging. The next
day he walked through the town, not so much to observe the
beauties, which were indifferent to him, as to take proper
measures to execute his pernicious designs. He introduced himself
into the most frequented places, where he listened to everybody's
discourse. In a place where people resort to divert themselves
with games of various kinds, and where some were conversing,
while others played, he heard some persons talk of the virtue and
piety of a woman called Fatima, who was retired from the world,
and of the miracles she wrought. As he fancied that this woman
might be serviceable to him in the project he had conceived, he
took one of the company aside, and requested to be informed more
particularly who that holy woman was, and what sort of miracles
she performed.</p>

<p id="id03105">"What!" said the person whom he addressed, "have you never seen
or heard of her? She is the admiration of the whole town, for her
fasting, her austerities, and her exemplary life. Except Mondays
and Fridays, she never stirs out of her little cell; and on those
days on which she comes into the town she does an infinite deal
of good; for there is not a person that has the headache but is
cured by her laying her hand upon them."</p>

<p id="id03106">The magician wanted no further information. He only asked the
person in what part of the town this holy woman's cell was
situated. After he had informed himself on this head, he
determined on the detestable design of murdering her and assuming
her character. With this view he watched all her steps the first
day she went out after he had made this inquiry, without losing
sight of her till evening, when he saw her re-enter her cell.
When he had fully observed the place, he went to one of those
houses where they sell a certain hot liquor, and where any person
may pass the night, particularly in the great heats, when the
people of that country prefer lying on a mat to a bed. About
midnight, after the magician had satisfied the master of the
house for what little he had called for, he went out, and
proceeded directly to the cell of Fatima. He had no difficulty to
open the door, which was only fastened with a latch, and he shut
it again after he had entered, without any noise. When he entered
the cell, he perceived Fatima by moonlight lying in the air on a
sofa covered only by an old mat, with her head leaning against
the wall. He awakened her, and clapped a dagger to her breast.</p>

<p id="id03107">The pious Fatima opening her eyes, was much surprised to see a
man with a dagger at her breast ready to stab her, and who said
to her, "If you cry out, or make the least noise, I will kill
you; but get up, and do as I shall direct you."</p>

<p id="id03108">Fatima, who had lain down in her habit, got up, trembling with fear.
"Do not be so much frightened," said the magician; "I only want your
habit, give it me and take mine." Accordingly Fatima and he changed
clothes. He then said to her, "Colour my face, that I may be like
you;" but perceiving that the poor creature could not help trembling,
to encourage her he said, "I tell you again you need not fear
anything: I swear by the name of God I will not take away your life."
Fatima lighted her lamp, led him into the cell, and dipping a soft
brush in a certain liquor, rubbed it over his face, assured him the
colour would not change, and that his face was of the same hue as her
own: after which, she put her own head-dress on his head, also a veil,
with which she shewed him how to hide his face as he passed through
the town. After this, she put a long string of beads about his neck,
which hung down to the middle of his body, and giving him the stick
she used to walk with in his hand, brought him a looking-glass, and
bade him look if he was not as like her as possible. The magician
found himself disguised as he wished to be; but he did not keep the
oath he so solemnly swore to the good Fatima; but instead of stabbing
her, for fear the blood might discover him, he strangled her; and when
he found she was dead, threw her body into a cistern just by the cell.</p>

<p id="id03109">The magician, thus disguised like the holy woman Fatima, spent
the remainder of the night in the cell. The next morning, two
hours after sunrise, though it was not a day the holy woman used
to go out on, he crept out of the cell, being well persuaded that
nobody would ask him any questions; or, if they should, he had an
answer ready for them. As one of the first things he did after
his arrival was to find out Alla ad Deen's palace, where he was
to complete his designs, he went directly thither.</p>

<p id="id03110">As soon as the people saw the holy woman, as they imagined him to
be, they presently gathered about him in a great crowd. Some
begged his blessing, others kissed his hand, and others, more
reserved, only the hem of his garment; while others, whether
their heads ached, or they wished to be preserved against that
disorder, stooped for him to lay his hands upon them; which he
did, muttering some words in form of prayer; and, in short,
counterfeited so well, that everybody took him for the holy
woman.</p>

<p id="id03111">After frequently stopping to satisfy people of this description, who
received neither good nor harm from this imposition of hands, he came
at last to the square before Alla ad Deen's palace. The crowd was so
great that the eagerness to get at him increased in proportion. Those
who were the most zealous and strong forced their way through the
crowd. There were such quarrels, and so great a noise, that the
princess, who was in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, heard it,
and asked what was the matter; but nobody being able to give her an
answer, she ordered them to inquire and inform her. One of her women
looked out of a window, and then told her it was a great crowd of
people collected about the holy woman to be cured of the headache by
the imposition of her hands.</p>

<p id="id03112">The princess, who had long heard of this holy woman, but had
never seen her, was very desirous to have some conversation with
her, which the chief of the eunuchs perceiving, told her it was
an easy matter to bring her to her, if she desired and commanded
it; and the princess expressing her wishes, he immediately sent
four eunuchs for the pretended holy woman.</p>

<p id="id03113">As soon as the crowd saw the eunuchs, they made way, and the
magician perceiving also that they were coming for him, advanced
to meet them, overjoyed to find his plot proceeded so well. "Holy
woman," said one of the eunuchs, "the princess wants to see you,
and has sent us for you." "The princess does me too great an
honour," replied the false Fatima; "I am ready to obey her
command," and at the same time followed the eunuchs to the
palace.</p>

<p id="id03114">When the magician, who under a holy garment disguised a wicked
heart, was introduced into the great hall, and perceived the
princess, he began a prayer, which contained a long enumeration
of vows and good wishes for the princess's health and prosperity,
and that she might have every thing she desired. He then
displayed all his hypocritical rhetoric, to insinuate himself
into the princess's favour under the cloak of piety, which it was
no hard matter for him to do; for as the princess herself was
naturally good, she was easily persuaded that all the world were
like her, especially those who made profession of serving God in
solitude.</p>

<p id="id03115">When the pretended Fatima had finished his long harangue, the
princess said to him, "I thank you, good mother, for your
prayers: I have great confidence in them, and hope God will hear
them. Come, and sit by me." The false Fatima sat down with
affected modesty: the princess then resuming her discourse, said,
"My good mother, I have one thing to request, which you must not
refuse me; it is to stay with me, that you may edify me with your
way of living; and that I may learn from your good example how to
serve God." "Princess," said the counterfeit Fatima, "I beg of
you not to ask what I cannot consent to, without neglecting my
prayers and devotion." "That shall be no hinderance to you,"
answered the princess; "I have a great many apartments
unoccupied; you shall choose which you like best, and have as
much liberty to perform your devotions as if you were in your own
cell."</p>

<p id="id03116">The magician, who desired nothing more than to introduce himself
into the palace, where it would be a much easier matter for him
to execute his designs, under the favour and protection of the
princess, than if he had been forced to come and go from the cell
to the palace, did not urge much to excuse himself from accepting
the obliging offer which the princess made him. "Princess," said
he, "whatever resolution a poor wretched woman as I am may have
made me renounce the pomp and grandeur of this world, I dare not
presume to oppose the will and commands of so pious and
charitable a princess."</p>

<p id="id03117">Upon this the princess, rising up, said, "Come with me, I will
shew you what vacant apartments I have, that you may make choice
of that you like best." The magician followed the princess, and
of all the apartments she shewed him, made choice of that which
was the worst furnished, saying it was too good for him, and that
he only accepted of it to please her.</p>

<p id="id03118">Afterwards the princess would have brought him back again into
the great hall to make him dine with her; but he considering that
he should then be obliged to shew his face, which he had always
taken care to conceal; and fearing that the princess should find
out that he was not Fatima, he begged of her earnestly to excuse
him, telling her that he never ate anything but bread and dried
fruits, and desiring to eat that slight repast in his own
apartment. The princess granted his request, saying, "You may be
as free here, good mother, as if you were in your own cell: I
will order you a dinner, but remember I expect you as soon as you
have finished your repast."</p>

<p id="id03119">After the princess had dined, and the false Fatima had been
informed by one of the eunuchs that she was risen from table, he
failed not to wait upon her. "My good mother," said the princess,
"I am overjoyed to have the company of so holy a woman as
yourself, who will confer a blessing upon this palace. But now I
am speaking of the palace, pray how do you like it? And before I
shew it all to you, tell me first what you think of this hall."</p>

<p id="id03120">Upon this question, the counterfeit Fatima, who, to act his part
the better, affected to hang down his head, without so much as
ever once lifting it, at last looked up, and surveyed the hall
from one end to the other. When he had examined it well, he said
to the princess, "As far as such a solitary being as I am, who am
unacquainted with what the world calls beautiful, can judge, this
hall is truly admirable and most beautiful; there wants but one
thing." "What is that, good mother?" demanded the princess; "tell
me, I conjure you. For my part, I always believed, and have heard
say, it wanted nothing; but if it does, it shall be supplied."</p>

<p id="id03121">"Princess," said the false Fatima, with great dissimulation,
"forgive me the liberty I have taken; but my opinion is, if it
can be of any importance, that if a roe's egg were hung up in the
middle of the dome, this hall would have no parallel in the four
quarters of the world, and your palace would be the wonder of the
unit verse."</p>

<p id="id03122">"My good mother," said the princess, "what bird is a roe, and
where may one get an egg?" "Princess," replied the pretended
Fatima, "it is a bird of prodigious size, which inhabits the
summit of mount Caucasus; the architect who built your palace can
get you one."</p>

<p id="id03123">After the princess had thanked the false Fatima for what she
believed her good advice, she conversed with her upon other
matters; but could not forget the roe's egg, which she resolved
to request of Alla ad Deen when he returned from hunting. He had
been gone six days, which the magician knew, and therefore took
advantage of his absence; but he returned that evening after the
false Fatima had taken leave of the princess, and retired to his
apartment. As soon as he arrived, he went directly to the
princess's apartment, saluted and embraced her, but she seemed to
receive him coldly. "My princess," said he, "I think you are not
so cheerful as you used to be; has any thing happened during my
absence, which has displeased you, or given you any trouble or
dissatisfaction In the name of God, do not conceal it from me; I
will leave nothing undone that is in my power to please you." "It
is a trifling matter," replied the princess, "which gives me so
little concern that I could not have thought you could have
perceived it in my countenance; but since you have unexpectedly
discovered some alteration, I will no longer disguise a matter of
so little consequence from you."</p>

<p id="id03124">"I always believed," continued the princess, "that our palace was
the most superb, magnificent, and complete in the world: but I
will tell you now what I find fault with, upon examining the hall
of four-and-twenty windows. Do not you think with me, that it
would be complete if a roe's egg were hung up in the midst of the
dome?" "Princess," replied Alla ad Deen, "it is enough that you
think there wants such an ornament; you shall see by the
diligence used to supply that deficiency, that there is nothing
which I would not do for your sake."</p>

<p id="id03125">Alla ad Deen left the princess Buddir al Buddoor that moment, and
went up into the hall of four-and-twenty windows, where pulling
out of his bosom the lamp, which, after the danger he had been
exposed to, he always carried about him, he rubbed it; upon which
the genie immediately appeared. "Genie," said Alla ad Deen,
"there wants a roe's egg to be hung up in the midst of the dome;
I command thee, in the name of this lamp, to repair the
deficiency." Alla ad Deen had no sooner pronounced these words,
than the genie gave so loud and terrible a cry, that the hall
shook, and Alla ad Deen could scarcely stand upright. "What!
wretch," said the genie, in a voice that would have made the most
undaunted man tremble, "is it not enough that I and my companions
have done every thing for you, but you, by an unheard-of
ingratitude, must command me to bring my master, and hang him up
in the midst of this dome? This attempt deserves that you, your
wife, and your palace, should be immediately reduced to ashes:
but you are happy that this request does not come from yourself.
Know then, that the true author is the brother of the African
magician, your enemy, whom you have destroyed as he deserved. He
is now in your palace, disguised in the habit of the holy woman
Fatima, whom he has murdered; and it is he who has suggested to
your wife to make this pernicious demand. His design is to kill
you, therefore take care of yourself." After these words, the
genie disappeared.</p>

<p id="id03126">Alla ad Deen lost not a word of what the genie had said. He had
heard talk of the holy woman Fatima, and how she pretended to
cure the headache. He returned to the princess's apartment, and
without mentioning a word of what had happened, sat down, and
complained of a great pain which had suddenly seized his head;
upon which the princess ordered the holy woman to be called, and
then told him how she had invited her to the palace, and that she
had appointed her an apartment.</p>

<p id="id03127">When the pretended Fatima came, Alla ad Deen said, "Come hither,
good mother; I am glad to see you here at so fortunate a time; I
am tormented with a violent pain in my head, and request your
assistance, by the confidence I have in your good prayers, and
hope you will not refuse me that favour which you do to so many
persons afflicted with this complaint." So saying, he arose, but
held down his head. The counterfeit Fatima advanced towards him,
with his hand all the time on a dagger concealed in his girdle
under his gown; which Alla ad Deen observing, he seized his hand
before he had drawn it, pierced him to the heart with his own
dagger, and then pushed him down on the floor.</p>

<p id="id03128">"My dear husband, what have you done?" cried the princess in
surprise. "You have killed the holy woman." "No, my princess,"
answered Alla ad Deen, with emotion, "I have not killed Fatima,
but a villain, who would have assassinated me, if I had not
prevented him. This wicked wretch," added he, uncovering his
face, "has strangled Fatima, whom you accuse me of killing, and
disguised himself in her clothes with intent to murder me: but
that you may know him better, he is brother to the African
magician." Alla ad Deen then informed her how he came to know
these particulars, and afterwards ordered the dead body to be
taken away.</p>

<p id="id03129">Thus was Alla ad Deen delivered from the persecution of two
brothers, who were magicians. Within a few years afterwards, the
sultan died in a good old age, and as he left no male children,
the princess Buddir al Buddoor, as lawful heir of the throne,
succeeded him, and communicating the power to Alla ad Deen, they
reigned together many years, and left a numerous and illustrious
posterity.</p>
