<p id="id00740">One of the blacks, who understood Arabic, hearing me speak thus,
came towards me, and said, "Brother, be not surprised to see us,
we are inhabitants of this country, and came hither to-day to
water our fields, by digging little canals from this river, which
comes out of the neighbouring mountain. We observed something
floating upon the water, went to see what it was, and, perceiving
your raft, one of us swam into the river, and brought it thither,
where we fastened it, as you see, until you should awake. Pray
tell us your history, for it must be extraordinary; how did you
venture yourself into this river, and whence did you come?" "I
begged of them first to give me something to eat, and then I
would satisfy their curiosity. They gave me several sorts of
food, and when I had satisfied my hunger, I related all that had
befallen me, which they listened to with attentive surprise. As
soon as I had finished, they told me, by the person who spoke
Arabic and interpreted to them what I said, that it was one of
the most wonderful stories they had ever heard, and that I must
go along with them, and tell it their king myself; it being too
extraordinary to be related by any other than the person to whom
the events had happened. I assured them that I was ready to do
whatever they pleased."</p>

<p id="id00741">They immediately sent for a horse, which was brought in a little
time; and having helped me to mount, some of them walked before
to shew the way, while the rest took my raft and cargo and
followed.</p>

<p id="id00742">We marched till we came to the capital of Serendib, for it was in
that island I had landed. The blacks presented me to their king;
I approached his throne, and saluted him as I used to do the
kings of the Indies; that is to say, I prostrated myself at his
feet. The prince ordered me to rise, received me with an obliging
air, and made me sit down near him. He first asked me my name,
and I answered, "People call me Sinbad the voyager, because of
the many voyages I have undertaken, and I am a citizen of
Bagdad." "But," resumed he, "how came you into my dominions, and
from whence came you last?"</p>

<p id="id00743">I concealed nothing from the king; I related to him all that I
have told you, and his majesty was so surprised and pleased, that
he commanded my adventures to be written in letters of gold, and
laid up in the archives of his kingdom. At last my raft was
brought in, and the bales opened in his presence; he admired the
quantity of wood of aloes and ambergris, but, above all, the
rubies and emeralds, for he had none in his treasury that
equalled them.</p>

<p id="id00744">Observing that he looked on my jewels with pleasure, and viewed
the most remarkable among them one after another, I fell
prostrate at his feet, and took the liberty to say to him, "Sir,
not only my person is at your majesty's service, but the cargo of
the raft, and I would beg of you to dispose of it as your own."
He answered me with a smile, "Sinbad, I will take care not to
covet any thing of yours, or to take any thing from you that God
has given you; far from lessening your wealth, I design to
augment it, and will not let you quit my dominions without marks
of my liberality." All the answer I returned were prayers for the
prosperity of that nobly minded prince, and commendations of his
generosity and bounty. He charged one of his officers to take
care of me, and ordered people to serve me at his own expence.
The officer was very faithful in the execution of his commission,
and caused all the goods to be carried to the lodgings provided
for me.</p>

<p id="id00745">I went every day at a set hour to make my court to the king, and
spent the rest of my time in viewing the city, and what was most
worthy of notice.</p>

<p id="id00746">The isle of Serendib is situated just under the equinoctial line;
so that the days and nights there are always of twelve hours
each, and the island is eighty parasangs in length, and as many
in breadth.</p>

<p id="id00747">The capital stands at the end of a fine valley, in the middle of
the island, encompassed by mountains the highest in the world.
They are seen three days' sail off at sea. Rubies and several
sorts of minerals abound, and the rocks are for the most part
composed of a metalline stone made use of to cut and polish other
precious stones. All kinds of rare plants and trees grow there,
especially cedars and cocoa-nut. There is also a pearl-fishing in
the mouth of its principal river; and in some of its valleys are
found diamonds. I made, by way of devotion, a pilgrimage to the
place where Adam was confined after his banishment from Paradise,
and had the curiosity to go to the top of the mountain.</p>

<p id="id00748">When I returned to the city, I prayed the king to allow me to
return to my own country, and he granted me permission in the
most obliging and most honourable manner. He would needs force a
rich present upon me; and when I went to take my leave of him, he
gave me one much more considerable, and at the same time charged
me with a letter for the commander of the faithful, our
sovereign, saying to me, "I pray you give this present from me,
and this letter to the caliph, and assure him of my friendship."
I took the present and letter in a very respectful manner, and
promised his majesty punctually to execute the commission with
which he was pleased to honour me. Before I embarked, this prince
sent for the captain and the merchants who were to go with me,
and ordered them to treat me with all possible respect.</p>

<p id="id00749">The letter from the king of Serendib was written on the skin of a
certain animal of great value, because of its being so scarce,
and of a yellowish colour. The characters of this letter were of
azure, and the contents as follows:</p>

<p id="id00750">"The king of the Indies, before whom march one hundred elephants,
who lives in a palace that shines with one hundred thousand
rubies, and who has in his treasury twenty thousand crowns
enriched with diamonds, to caliph Haroon al Rusheed.</p>

<p id="id00751">"Though the present we send you be inconsiderable, receive it
however as a brother and a friend, in consideration of the hearty
friendship which we bear for you, and of which we are willing to
give you proof. We desire the same part in your friendship,
considering that we believe it to be our merit, being of the same
dignity with yourself. We conjure you this in quality of a
brother. Adieu."</p>

<p id="id00752">The present consisted first, of one single ruby made into a cup,
about half a foot high, an inch thick, and filled with round
pearls of half a drachm each. 2. The skin of a serpent, whose
scales were as large as an ordinary piece of gold, and had the
virtue to preserve from sickness those who lay upon it. 3. Fifty
thousand drachms of the best wood of aloes, with thirty grains of
camphire as big as pistachios. 4. A female slave of ravishing
beauty, whose apparel was all covered over with jewels.</p>

<p id="id00753">The ship set sail, and after a very successful navigation we
landed at Bussorah, and from thence I went to Bagdad, where the
first thing I did was to acquit myself of my commission.</p>

<p id="id00754">Scheherazade stopped, because day appeared, and next night
proceeded thus.</p>

<p id="id00755">I took the king of Serendib's letter, and went to present myself
at the gate of the commander of the faithful, followed by the
beautiful slave, and such of my own family as carried the
presents. I stated the reason of my coming, and was immediately
conducted to the throne of the caliph. I made my reverence, and,
after a short speech, gave him the letter and present. When he
had read what the king of Serendib wrote to him, he asked me, if
that prince were really so rich and potent as he represented
himself in his letter? I prostrated myself a second time, and
rising again, said, "Commander of the faithful, I can assure your
majesty he doth not exceed the truth. I bear him witness. Nothing
is more worthy of admiration than the magnificence of his palace.
When the prince appears in public, he has a throne fixed on the
back of an elephant, and marches betwixt two ranks of his
ministers, favourites, and other people of his court; before him,
upon the same elephant, an officer carries a golden lance in his
hand; and behind the throne there is another, who stands upright,
with a column of gold, on the top of which is an emerald half a
foot long, and an inch thick; before him march a guard of one
thousand men, clad in cloth of gold and silk, and mounted on
elephants richly caparisoned.</p>

<p id="id00756">"While the king is on his march, the officer, who is before him on the
same elephant, cries from time to time, with a loud voice, 'Behold the
great monarch, the potent and redoubtable sultan of the Indies, whose
palace is covered with one hundred thousand rubies, and who possesses
twenty thousand crowns of diamonds. Behold the monarch greater than
Solomon, and the powerful Maha-raja.' After he has pronounced those
words, the officer behind the throne cries in his turn, 'This monarch,
so great and so powerful, must die, must die, must die.' And the
officer before replies, 'Praise be to him who lives for ever.'</p>

<p id="id00757">"Farther, the king of Serendib is so just, that there are no
judges in his dominions. His people have no need of them. They
understand and observe justice rigidly of themselves."</p>

<p id="id00758">The caliph was much pleased with my account. "The wisdom of that
king," said he, "appears in his letter, and after what you tell
me, I must confess, that his wisdom is worthy of his people, and
his people deserve so wise a prince." Having spoken thus, he
dismissed me, and sent me home with a rich present.</p>

<p id="id00759">Sinbad left off, and his company retired, Hindbad having first
received one hundred sequins; and next day they returned to hear
the relation of his seventh and last voyage.</p>

<h6 id="id00760" style="margin-top: 4em">The Seventh and Last Voyage.</h6>

<p id="id00761" style="margin-top: 3em">Being returned from my sixth voyage, said Sinbad, I absolutely
laid aside all thoughts of travelling; for, besides that my age
now required rest, I was resolved no more to expose myself to
such risks as I had encountered; so that I thought of nothing but
to pass the rest of my days in tranquillity. One day as I was
treating my friends, one of my servants came and told me that an
officer of the caliph's enquired for me. I rose from table, and
went to him. "The caliph," he said, "has sent me to tell you,
that he must speak with you." I followed the officer to the
palace, where being presented to the caliph, I saluted him by
prostrating myself at his feet. "Sinbad," said he to me, "I stand
in need of your service; you must carry my answer and present to
the king of Serendib. It is but just I should return his
civility."</p>

<p id="id00762">This command of the caliph was to me like a clap of thunder.
"Commander of the faithful," I replied, "I am ready to do
whatever your majesty shall think fit to command; but I beseech
you most humbly to consider what I have undergone. I have also
made a vow never to go out of Bagdad." Hence I took occasion to
give him a full and particular account of all my adventures,
which he had the patience to hear out.</p>

<p id="id00763">As soon as I had finished, "I confess," said he, "that the things
you tell me are very extraordinary, yet you must for my sake
undertake this voyage which I propose to you. You will only have
to go to the isle of Serendib, and deliver the commission which I
give you. After that you are at liberty to return. But you must
go; for you know it would not comport with my dignity, to be
indebted to the king of that island." Perceiving that the caliph
insisted upon my compliance, I submitted, and told him that I was
willing to obey. He was very well pleased, and ordered me one
thousand sequins for the expences of my journey.</p>

<p id="id00764">I prepared for my departure in a few days, and as soon as the
caliph's letter and present were delivered to me, I went to
Bussorah, where I embarked, and had a very happy voyage. Having
arrived at the isle of Serendib, I acquainted the king's
ministers with my commission, and prayed them to get me speedy
audience. They did so, and I was conducted to the palace in an
honourable manner, where I saluted the king by prostration,
according to custom. That prince knew me immediately, and
testified very great joy at seeing me. "Sinbad," said he, "you
are welcome; I have many times thought of you since you departed;
I bless the day on which we see one another once more." I made my
compliment to him, and after having thanked him for his kindness,
delivered the caliph's letter and present, which he received with
all imaginable satisfaction.</p>

<p id="id00765">The caliph's present was a complete suit of cloth of gold, valued
at one thousand sequins; fifty robes of rich stuff, a hundred of
white cloth, the finest of Cairo, Suez, and Alexandria; a vessel
of agate broader than deep, an inch thick, and half a foot wide,
the bottom of which represented in bass relief a man with one
knee on the ground, who held bow and an arrow, ready to discharge
at a lion. He sent him also a rich tablet, which, according to
tradition, belonged to the great Solomon. The caliph's letter was
as follows:</p>

<p id="id00766">"Greeting, in the name of the sovereign guide of the right way,
from the dependent on God, Haroon al Rusheed, whom God hath set
in the place of vicegerent to his prophet, after his ancestors of
happy memory, to the potent and esteemed Raja of Serendib.</p>

<p id="id00767">"We received your letter with joy, and send you this from our
imperial residence, the garden of superior wits. We hope when you
look upon it, you will perceive our good intention and be pleased
with it. Adieu."</p>

<p id="id00768">The king of Serendib was highly gratified that the caliph
answered his friendship. A little time after this audience, I
solicited leave to depart, and had much difficulty to obtain it.
I procured it however at last, and the king, when he dismissed
me, made me a very considerable present. I embarked immediately
to return to Bagdad, but had not the good fortune to arrive there
so speedily as I had hoped. God ordered it otherwise.</p>

<p id="id00769">Three or four days after my departure, we were attacked by
corsairs, who easily seized upon our ship, because it was no
vessel of force. Some of the crew offered resistance, which cost
them their lives. But for myself and the rest, who were not so
imprudent, the corsairs saved us on purpose to make slaves of us.</p>

<p id="id00770">We were all stripped, and instead of our own clothes, they gave
us sorry rags, and carried us into a remote island, where they
sold us.</p>

<p id="id00771">I fell into the hands of a rich merchant, who, as soon as he
bought me, carried me to his house, treated me well, and clad me
handsomely for a slave. Some days after, not knowing who I was,
he asked me if I understood any trade? I answered, that I was no
mechanic, but a merchant, and that the corsairs, who sold me, had
robbed me of all I possessed. "But tell me," replied he, "can you
shoot with a bow?" I answered, that the bow was one of my
exercises in my youth. He gave me a bow and arrows, and, taking
me behind him upon an elephant, carried me to a thick forest some
leagues from the town. We penetrated a great way into the wood,
and when he thought fit to stop, he bade me alight; then shewing
me a great tree, "Climb up that," said he, "and shoot at the
elephants as you see them pass by, for there is a prodigious
number of them in this forest, and if any of them fall, come and
give me notice." Having spoken thus, he left me victuals, and
returned to the town, and I continued upon the tree all night.</p>

<p id="id00772">I saw no elephant during that time, but next morning, as soon as
the sun was up, I perceived a great number. I shot several arrows
among them, and at last one of the elephants fell, when the rest
retired immediately, and left me at liberty to go and acquaint my
patron with my booty. When I had informed him, he gave me a good
meal, commended my dexterity, and caressed me highly. We went
afterwards together to the forest, where we dug a hole for the
elephant; my patron designing to return when it was rotten, and
take his teeth to trade with.</p>

<p id="id00773">I continued this employment for two months, and killed an
elephant every day, getting sometimes upon one tree, and
sometimes upon another. One morning, as I looked for the
elephants, I perceived with extreme amazement, that, instead of
passing by me across the forest as usual, they stopped, and came
to me with a horrible noise, in such number that the plain was
covered, and shook under them. They encompassed the tree in which
I was concealed, with their trunks extended, and all fixed their
eyes upon. At this alarming spectacle I continued immoveable, and
was so much terrified, that my bow and arrows fell out of my
hand.</p>

<p id="id00774">My fears were not without cause; for after the elephants had
stared upon me some time, one of the largest of them put his
trunk round the foot of the tree, plucked it up, and threw it on
the ground; I fell with the tree, and the elephant taking me up
with his trunk, laid me on his back, where I sat more like one
dead than alive, with my quiver on my shoulder. He put himself
afterwards at the head of the rest, who followed him in troops,
carried me a considerable way, then laid me down on the ground,
and retired with all his companions. Conceive, if you can, the
condition I was in: I thought myself in a dream. After having
lain some time, and seeing the elephants gone, I got up, and
found I was upon a long and broad hill, almost covered with the
bones and teeth of elephants. I confess to you, that this object
furnished me with abundance of reflections. I admired the
instinct of those animals; I doubted not but that was their
burying place, and that they carried me thither on purpose to
tell me that I should forbear to persecute them, since I did it
only for their teeth. I did not stay on the hill, but turned
towards the city, and, after having travelled a day and a night,
I came to my patron. I met no elephant in my way, which made me
think they had retired farther into the forest, to leave me at
liberty to come back to the hill without any obstacle.</p>

<p id="id00775">As soon as my patron saw me; "Ah, poor Sinbad," exclaimed he, "I
was in great trouble to know what was become of you. I have been
at the forest, where I found a tree newly pulled up, and a bow
and arrows on the ground, and after having sought for you in
vain, I despaired of ever, seeing you more. Pray tell me what
befell you, and by what good chance thou art still alive." I
satisfied his curiosity, and going both of us next morning to the
hill, he found to his great joy that what I had told him was
true. We loaded the elephant which had carried us with as many
teeth as he could bear; and when we were returned, "Brother,"
said my patron, "for I will treat you no more as my slave, after
having made such a discovery as will enrich me, God bless you
with all happiness and prosperity. I declare before him, that I
give you your liberty. I concealed from you what I am now going
to tell you.</p>

<p id="id00776">"The elephants of our forest have every year killed us a great
many slaves, whom we sent to seek ivory. For all the cautions we
could give them, those crafty animals destroyed them one time or
other. God has delivered you from their fury, and has bestowed
that favour upon you only. It is a sign that he loves you, and
has some use for your service in the world. You have procured me
incredible wealth. Formerly we could not procure ivory but by
exposing the lives of our slaves, and now our whole city is
enriched by your means. Do not think I pretend to have rewarded
you by giving you your liberty, I will also give you considerable
riches. I could engage all our city to contribute towards making
your fortune, but I will have the glory of doing it myself."</p>

<p id="id00777">To this obliging declaration I replied, "Patron, God preserve
you. Your giving me my liberty is enough to discharge what you
owe me, and I desire no other reward for the service I had the
good fortune to do to you and your city, but leave to return to
my own country." "Very well," said he, "the monsoon will in a
little time bring ships for ivory. I will then send you home, and
give you wherewith to bear your charges." I thanked him again for
my liberty and his good intentions towards me. I staid with him
expecting the monsoon; and during that time, we made so many
journeys to the hill, that we filled all our warehouses with
ivory. The other merchants, who traded in it, did the same, for
it could not be long concealed from them.</p>

<p id="id00778">The ships arrived at last, and my patron, himself having made
choice of the ship wherein I was to embark, loaded half of it
with ivory on my account, laid in provisions in abundance for my
passage, and besides obliged me to accept a present of some
curiosities of the country of great value. After I had returned
him a thousand thanks for all his favours, I went aboard. We set
sail, and as the adventure which procured me this liberty was
very extraordinary, I had it continually in my thoughts.</p>

<p id="id00779">We stopped at some islands to take in fresh provisions. Our
vessel being come to a port on the main land in the Indies, we
touched there, and not being willing to venture by sea to
Bussorah, I landed my proportion of the ivory, resolving to
proceed on my journey by land. I made vast sums of my ivory,
bought several rarities, which I intended for presents, and when
my equipage was ready, set out in company with a large caravan of
merchants. I was a long time on the way, and suffered much, but
endured all with patience, when I considered that I had nothing
to fear from the seas, from pirates, from serpents, or from the
other perils to which I had been exposed.</p>

<p id="id00780">All these fatigues ended at last, and I arrived safe at Bagdad. I
went immediately to wait upon the caliph, and gave him an account
of my embassy. That prince said he had been uneasy, as I was so
long in returning, but that he always hoped God would preserve
me. When I told him the adventure of the elephants, he seemed
much surprised, and would never have given any credit to it had
he not known my veracity. He deemed this story, and the other
relations I had given him, to be so curious, that he ordered one
of his secretaries to write them in characters of gold, and lay
them up in his treasury. I retired well satisfied with the
honours I received, and the presents which he gave me; and ever
since I have devoted myself wholly to my family, kindred, and
friends.</p>

<p id="id00781">Sinbad here finished the relation of his seventh and last voyage,
and then addressing himself to Hindbad, "Well, friend," said he,
"did you ever hear of any person that suffered so much as I have
done, or of any mortal that has gone through so many
vicissitudes? Is it not reasonable that, after all this I should
enjoy a quiet and pleasant life?" As he said this, Hindbad drew
near to him, and kissing his hand, said, "I must acknowledge,
sir, that you have gone through many imminent dangers; my
troubles are not comparable to yours: if they afflict me for a
time, I comfort myself with the thoughts of the profit I get by
them. You not only deserve a quiet life, but are worthy of all
the riches you enjoy, because you make of them such a good and
generous use. May you therefore continue to live in happiness and
joy till the day of your death!" Sinbad gave him one hundred
sequins more, received him into the number of his friends,
desired him to quit his porter's employment, and come and dine
every day with him, that he might have reason to remember Sinbad
the voyager.</p>

<h2 id="id00782" style="margin-top: 4em">                       THE THREE APPLES.</h2>

<p id="id00783" style="margin-top: 3em">The Caliph Haroon al Rusheed one day commanded the grand vizier
Jaffier to come to his palace the night following. "Vizier," said
he, "I will take a walk round the town, to inform myself what
people say, and particularly how they are pleased with my
officers of justice. If there be any against whom they have cause
of just complaint, we will turn them out, and put others in their
stead, who shall officiate better. If, on the contrary, there be
any that have gained their applause, we will have that esteem for
them which they deserve." The grand vizier being come to the
palace at the hour appointed, the caliph, he, and Mesrour the
chief of the eunuchs, disguised themselves so that they could not
be known, and went out all three together.</p>

<p id="id00784">They passed through several places, and by several markets. As
they entered a small street, they perceived by the light of the
moon, a tall man, with a white beard, who carried nets on his
head, and a staff in his hand. "To judge from his appearance,"
said the caliph, "that old man is not rich; let us go to him and
inquire into his circumstances." "Honest man," said the vizier,
"who art thou?" The old man replied, "Sir, I am a fisher, but one
of the poorest and most miserable of the trade. I went from my
house about noon a fishing, and from that time to this I have not
been able to catch one fish; at the same time I have a wife and
small children, and nothing to maintain them."</p>

<p id="id00785">The caliph, moved with compassion, said to the fisherman, "Hast
thou the courage to go back and cast thy net once more? We will
give thee a hundred sequins for what thou shalt bring up." At
this proposal, the fisherman, forgetting all his day's toil, took
the caliph at his word, and returned to the Tigris, accompanied
by the caliph, Jaaffier, and Mesrour; saying to himself as he
went, "These gentlemen seem too honest and reasonable not to
reward my pains; and if they give me the hundredth part of what
they promise, it will be an ample recompence."</p>

<p id="id00786">They came to the bank of the river, and the fisherman, having
thrown in his net, when he drew it again, brought up a trunk
close shut, and very heavy. The caliph made the grand vizier pay
him one hundred sequins immediately, and sent him away. Mesrour,
by his master's order, carried the trunk on his shoulder, and the
caliph was so very eager to know what it contained, that he
returned to the palace with all speed. When the trunk was opened,
they found in it a large basket made of palm-leaves, shut up, and
the covering of it sewed with red thread. To satisfy the caliph's
impatience, they would not take time to undo it, but cut the
thread with a knife, and took out of the basket a package wrapt
up in a sorry piece of hanging, and bound about with a rope;
which being untied, they found, to their great amazement, the
corpse of a young lady, whiter than snow, all cut in pieces.</p>

<p id="id00787">The astonishment of the caliph was great at this dreadful
spectacle. His surprise was instantly changed into passion, and
darting an angry look at the vizier, "Thou wretch," said he, "is
this your inspection into the actions of my people? Do they
commit such impious murders under thy ministry in my capital, and
throw my subjects into the Tigris, that they may cry for
vengeance against me at the day of judgment? If thou dost not
speedily avenge the murder of this woman, by the death of her
murderer, I swear by heaven, that I will cause thee and forty
more of thy kindred to be impaled." "Commander of the faithful,"
replied the grand vizier, "I beg your majesty to grant me time to
make enquiry." "I will allow thee no more," said the caliph,
"than three days."</p>

<p id="id00788">The vizier Jaaffier went home in great perplexity. "Alas!" said
he "how is it possible that in such a vast and populous city as
Bagdad, I should be able to detect a murderer, who undoubtedly
committed the crime without witness, and perhaps may be already
gone from hence? Any other vizier than I would take some wretched
person out of prison, and cause him to be put to death to satisfy
the caliph; but I will not burden my conscience with such a
barbarous action; I will rather die than preserve my life by the
sacrifice of another innocent person."</p>

<p id="id00789">He ordered the officers of the police and justice to make strict
search for the criminal. They sent their servants about, and they
were not idle themselves, for they were no less concerned in this
matter than the vizier. But all their endeavours were to no
purpose; what pains soever they took they could not discover the
murderer; so that the vizier concluded his life to be lost.</p>

<p id="id00790">The third day being arrived, an officer came to the unfortunate
minister, with a summons to follow him, which the vizier obeyed.
The caliph asked him for the murderer. He answered, "Commander of
the faithful, I have not found any person that could give me the
least account of him." The caliph, full of fury and rage, gave
him many reproachful words, and ordered that he and forty
Bermukkees should be impaled at the gate of the palace.</p>

<p id="id00791">In the mean while the stakes were preparing, and orders were sent
to seize forty Bermukkees in their houses; a public crier was
sent about the city by the caliph's order, to cry thus: "Those
who have a desire to see the grand vizier Jaaffier impaled, with
forty of his kindred, let them come to the square before the
palace."</p>

<p id="id00792">When all things were ready, the criminal judge, and many officers
belonging to the palace, having brought out the grand vizier with
the forty Bermukkees, set each by the stake designed for him. The
multitude of people that filled the square could not without
grief and tears behold this tragical sight; for the grand vizier
and the Bermukkees were loved and honoured on account of their
probity, bounty, and impartiality, not only in Bagdad, but
through all the dominions of the caliph.</p>

<p id="id00793">Nothing could prevent the execution of this prince's severe and
irrevocable sentence, and the lives of the most deserving people
in the city were just going to be sacrificed, when a young man of
handsome mien pressed through the crowd till he came up to the
grand vizier, and after he had kissed his hand, said, "Most
excellent vizier, chief of the emirs of this court, and comforter
of the poor, you are not guilty of the crime for which you stand
here. Withdraw, and let me expiate the death of the lady that was
thrown into the Tigris. It is I who murdered her, and I deserve
to be punished for my offence."</p>

<p id="id00794">Though these words occasioned great joy to the vizier, yet he
could not but pity the young man, in whose look he saw something
that instead of evincing guilt was engaging: but as he was about
to answer him, a tall man advanced in years, who had likewise
forced his way through the crowd, came up to him, saying, "Do not
believe what this young man tells you, I killed that lady who was
found in the trunk, and this punishment ought only to fall upon
me. I conjure you in the name of God not to punish the innocent
for the guilty." "Sir," said the young man to the vizier, "I do
protest that I am he who committed this vile act, and nobody else
had any concern in it." "My son," said the old man, "it is
despair that brought you hither, and you would anticipate your
destiny. I have lived a long while in the world, and it is time
for me to be gone; let me therefore sacrifice my life for yours."
"Sir," said he again to the vizier, "I tell you once more I am
the murderer; let me die without delay."</p>

<p id="id00795">The controversy between the old and the young man induced the
grand vizier to carry them both before the caliph, to which the
judge criminal consented, being glad to serve the vizier. When he
came before the prince, he kissed the ground seven times, and
spake after this manner: "Commander of the faithful, I have
brought here before your majesty this old and this young man,
each of whom declares himself to be the sole murderer of the
lady." The caliph asked the criminals which of them it was that
so cruelly murdered the lady, and threw her into the Tigris? The
young man assured him it was he, but the old man maintained the
contrary. "Go," said the caliph to the grand vizier, "and cause
them both to be impaled." "But, Sir," said the vizier, "if only
one of them be guilty, it would be unjust to take the lives of
both." At these words the young man spoke again, "I swear by the
great God, who has raised the heavens so high, that I am the man
who killed the lady, cut her in pieces, and about four days ago
threw her into the Tigris. I renounce my part of happiness
amongst the just at the day of judgment, if what I say be not
truth; therefore I am he that ought to suffer." The caliph being
surprised at this oath, believed him; especially since the old
man made no answer. Whereupon, turning to the young man,
"Wretch," said he, "what made thee commit that detestable crime,
and what is it that moves thee to offer thyself voluntarily to
die?" "Commander of the faithful," said he, "if all that has past
between that lady and me were set down in writing, it would be a
history that might be useful to other men." "I command thee then
to relate it," said the caliph. The young man obeyed, and began
his history.</p>

<p id="id00796" style="margin-top: 4em">&#160;&#160;The Story of the Lady who was Murdered, and of the Young Man her<br/>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Husband.<br/></p>

<p id="id00797" style="margin-top: 3em">Commander of the faithful, this murdered lady was my wife,
daughter of this old man, who is my uncle by the father's side.
She was not above twelve years old, when eleven years ago he gave
her to me. I have three children by her, all boys, yet alive, and
I must do her the justice to say, that she never gave me the
least occasion for offence; she was chaste, of good behaviour,
and made it her whole business to please me. And on my part I
ardently loved her, and in every thing rather anticipated than
opposed her wishes.</p>

<p id="id00798">About two months ago she fell sick; I took all imaginable care of
her, and spared nothing that could promote her speedy recovery.
After a month thus passed she began to grow better, and expressed
a wish to go to the bath. Before she went, "Cousin," said she
(for so she used to call me out of familiarity), "I long for some
apples; if you would get me any, you would greatly please me. I
have longed for them a great while, and I must own it is come to
that height, that if I be not satisfied very soon, I fear some
misfortune will befall me." "I will cheerfully try," said I, "and
do all in my power to make you easy."</p>

<p id="id00799">I went immediately round all the markets and shops in the town to
seek for apples, but I could not get one, though I offered to pay
a sequin a piece. I returned home much dissatisfied at my
failure; and for my wife, when she returned from the bagnio, and
saw no apples, she became so very uneasy, that she could not
sleep all night. I got up by times in the morning, and went
through all the gardens, but had no better success than the day
before; only I happened to meet an old gardener, who told me,
that all my pains would signify nothing, for I could not expect
to find apples any where but in your majesty's garden at
Bussorah. As I loved my wife passionately, and would not neglect
to satisfy her, I dressed myself in a traveller's habit, and
after I had told her my design, went to Bussorah, and made my
journey with such speed, that I returned at the end of fifteen
days with three apples, which cost me a sequin apiece, for as
there were no more left, the gardener would not let me have them
for less. As soon as I came home, I presented them to my wife,
but her longing had ceased, she satisfied herself with receiving
them, and laid them down by her. In the mean time she continued
sickly, and I knew not what remedy to procure for her relief.</p>

<p id="id00800">Some few days after I returned from my journey, sitting in my
shop in the public place where all sorts of fine stuffs are sold,
I saw an ugly, tall, black slave come in, with an apple in his
hand, which I knew to be one of those I had brought from
Bussorah. I had no reason to doubt it, because I was certain
there was not one to be had in Bagdad, nor in any of the gardens
in the vicinity. I called to him, and said, "Good slave, pr'ythee
tell me where thou hadst this apple?" "It is a present" (said he,
smiling) "from my mistress. I went to see her to-day, and found
her out of order. I saw three apples lying by her, and asked her
where she had them. She told me the good man, her husband, had
made a fortnight's journey on purpose, and brought them to her.
We had a collation together; and, when I took my leave of her, I
brought away this apple."</p>

<p id="id00801">This account rendered me distracted. I rose, shut up my shop, ran
home with all speed, and going to my wife's chamber, looked
immediately for the apples, and seeing only two, asked what was
become of the third. My wife, turning her head to the place where
the apples lay, and perceiving there were but two, answered me
coldly, "Cousin, I know not what is become of it." At this reply
I was convinced what the slave had told me was true; and giving
myself up to madness and jealousy, drew my knife from my girdle,
and thrust it into the unfortunate creature's throat. I
afterwards cut off her head, and divided her body into four
quarters, which I packed up in a bundle, sewed it up with a
thread of red yarn, put all together in a trunk, and when night
came, carried it on my shoulder down to the Tigris, where I sunk
it.</p>

<p id="id00802">The two youngest of my children were asleep, the third was out;
but at my return, I found him sitting by my gate, weeping. I
asked him the reason; "Father," said he, "I took this morning
from my mother, without her knowledge, one of those three apples
you brought her, and kept it a long while; but, as I was playing
some time ago with my little brother in the street, a tall slave
passing by snatched it out of my hands, and carried it away. I
ran after him, demanding it back, and besides told him, that it
belonged to my mother, who was sick; and that you had made a
fortnight's journey to procure it; but all to no purpose, he
would not restore it. And as I still followed him, crying out, he
turned and beat me, and then ran away as fast as he could from
one lane to another, till at length I lost sight of him. I have
since been walking without the town expecting your return, to
pray you, dear father, not to tell my mother of it, lest it
should make her worse!" When he had thus spoken he fell a weeping
again more bitterly than before.</p>

<p id="id00803">My son's account afflicted me beyond measure. I then found myself
guilty of an enormous crime, and repented too late of having so
easily believed the calumnies of a wretched slave, who, from what
he had learnt of my son, had invented that fatal falsehood.</p>

<p id="id00804">My uncle here present came just at that time to see his daughter,
but instead of finding her alive, understood from me that she was
dead, for I concealed nothing from him; and without staying for
his censure, declared myself the greatest criminal in the world.</p>

<p id="id00805">Upon this, instead of reproaching me, he joined his tears with
mine, and we together wept three days without intermission, he
for the loss of a daughter whom he had loved tenderly; and I for
the loss of a beloved wife, of whom I had deprived myself in so
cruel a manner by giving too easy credit to the report of a lying
slave.</p>

<p id="id00806">This, commander of the faithful, is the sincere confession your
majesty required from me. You have now heard all the
circumstances of my crime, and I must humbly beg of you to order
the punishment due for it; how severe soever it may be, I shall
not in the least complain, but esteem it too easy and light.</p>

<p id="id00807">The caliph was much astonished at the young man's relation. But
this just prince, finding he was rather to be pitied than
condemned, began to speak in his favour: "This young man's
crime," said he, "is pardonable before God, and excusable with
men. The wicked slave is the sole cause of this murder; it is he
alone that must be punished: wherefore," continued he, looking
upon the grand vizier, "I give you three days' time to find him
out; if you do not bring him within that space, you shall die in
his stead." The unfortunate Jaaffier, had thought himself out of
danger, was perplexed at this order of the caliph; but as he
durst not return any answer to the prince, whose hasty temper he
knew too well, he departed from his presence, and retired
melancholy to his house, convinced that he had but three days to
live; for he was so fully persuaded that he should not find the
slave, that he made not the least enquiry after him. "Is it
possible," said he, "that in such a city as Bagdad, where there
is an infinite number of negro slaves, I should be able to find
him out that is guilty? Unless God be pleased to interpose as he
hath already to detest the murderer, nothing can save my life."</p>

<p id="id00808">He spent the first two days in mourning with his family, who sat
round him weeping and complaining of the caliph's cruelty. The
third day being arrived, he prepared himself to die with courage,
as an honest minister, and one who had nothing to trouble his
conscience; he sent for notaries and witnesses' who signed his
will. After which he took leave of his wife and children, and
bade them farewell. All his family were drowned in tears, so that
there never was a more sorrowful spectacle. At last a messenger
came from the caliph to tell him that he was out of all patience,
having heard nothing from him concerning the negro slave whom he
had commanded him to search for; "I am therefore ordered," said
the messenger, "to bring you before his throne." The afflicted
vizier, obeyed the mandate, but as he was going out, they brought
him his youngest daughter, about five or six years of age, to
receive his last blessing.</p>

<p id="id00809">As he had a particular affection for that child, he prayed the
messenger to give him leave to stop a moment, and taking his
daughter in his arms, kissed her several times: as he kissed her,
he perceived she had something in her bosom that looked bulky,
and had a sweet scent. "My dear little one," said he, "what hast
thou in thy bosom?" "My dear father," she replied, "it is an
apple which our slave Rihan sold me for two sequins."</p>

<p id="id00810">At these words apple and slave, the grand vizier, uttered an
exclamation of surprise, intermixed with joy, and putting his
hand into the child's bosom, pulled out the apple. He caused the
slave, who was not far off, to be brought immediately, and when
he came, "Rascal," said he, "where hadst thou this apple?" "My
lord," replied the slave, "I swear to you that I neither stole it
in your house, nor out of the commander of the faithful's garden;
but the other day, as I was passing through a street where three
or four children were at play, one of them having it in his hand,
I snatched it from him, and carried it away. The child ran after
me, telling me it was not his own, but belonged mother, who was
sick; and that his father, to satisfy her longing, had made a
long journey, and brought home three apples, whereof this was
one, which he had taken from his mother without her knowledge. He
said all he could to prevail upon me to give it him back, but I
refused, and so brought it home, and sold it for two sequins to
the little lady your daughter."</p>

<p id="id00811">Jaaffier could not reflect without astonishment that the
mischievousness of a slave had been the cause of an innocent
woman's death, and nearly of his own. He carried the slave along
with him, and when he came before the caliph, gave the prince an
exact account of what the slave had told him, and the chance
which led him to the discovery of his crime.</p>

<p id="id00812">Never was any surprise so great as that of the caliph, yet he
could not refrain from falling into excessive fits of laughter.
At last he recovered himself, and with a serious air told the
vizier, that since his slave had been the occasion of murder, he
deserved an exemplary punishment. "I must own it," said the
vizier, "but his guilt is not unpardonable: I remember the
wonderful history of a vizier, of Cairo, and am ready to relate
it, upon condition that if your majesty finds it more astonishing
than that which gives me occasion to tell it, you will be pleased
to pardon my slave." "I consent," said the caliph; "but you
undertake a hard task, for I do not believe you can save your
slave, the story of the apples being so very singular." Upon
this, Jaaffier began his story thus:</p>

<p id="id00813" style="margin-top: 4em">   The Story of Noor ad Deen Ali and Buddir ad Deen Houssun.</p>

<p id="id00814" style="margin-top: 3em">Commander of the faithful, there was formerly a sultan of Egypt,
a strict observer of justice, gracious, merciful, and liberal,
and his valour made him terrible to his neighbours. He loved the
poor, and protected the learned, whom he advanced to the highest
dignities. This sultan had a vizier, who was prudent, wise,
sagacious, and well versed in all sciences. This minister had two
sons, who in every thing followed his footsteps. The eldest was
called Shumse ad Deen Mahummud, and the younger Noor ad Deen Ali.
The latter was endowed with all the good qualities that man could
possess.</p>

<p id="id00815">The vizier their father being dead, the sultan caused them both
to put on the robes of a vizier, "I am as sorry," said he, "as
you are for the loss of your father; and because I know you live
together, and love one another cordially, I will bestow his
dignity upon you conjointly; go, and imitate your father's
conduct."</p>

<p id="id00816">The two new viziers humbly thanked the sultan, and retired to
make due preparation for their father's interment. They did not
go abroad for a month, after which they repaired to court, and
attended their duties. When the sultan hunted, one of the
brothers accompanied him, and this honour they had by turns. One
evening as they were conversing together after a cheerful meal,
the next day being the elder brother's turn to hunt with the
sultan, he said to his younger brother, "Since neither of us is
yet married, and we live so affectionately together, let us both
wed the same day sisters out of some family that may suit our
quality. What do you think of this plan?" "Brother," answered the
other vizier, "there cannot be a better thought; for my part, I
will agree to any thing you approve." "But this is not all," said
the elder; "my fancy carries me farther: Suppose both our wives
should conceive the first night of our marriage, and should
happen to be brought to bed on one day, yours of a son, and mine
of a daughter, we will give them to each other in marriage."
"Nay," said Noor ad Deen aloud, "I must acknowledge that this
prospect is admirable; such a marriage will perfect our union,
and I willingly consent to it. But then, brother," said he
farther, "if this marriage should happen, would you expect that
my son should settle a jointure on your daughter?" "There is no
difficulty in that," replied the other; "for I am persuaded, that
besides the usual articles of the marriage contract, you will not
fail to promise in his name at least three thousand sequins,
three landed estates, and three slaves." "No," said the younger
"I will not consent to that; are we not brethren, and equal in
title and dignity? Do not you and I know what is just? The male
being nobler than the female, it is your part to give a large
dowry with your daughter. By what I perceive, you are a man that
would have your business done at another's charge."</p>

<p id="id00817">Although Noor ad Deen spoke these words in jest, his brother
being of a hasty temper, was offended, and falling into a passion
said, "A mischief upon your son, since you prefer him before my
daughter. I wonder you had so much confidence as to believe him
worthy of her; you must needs have lost your judgment to think
you are my equal, and say we are colleagues. I would have you to
know, that since you are so vain, I would not marry my daughter
to your son though you would give him more than you are worth."
This pleasant quarrel between two brothers about the marriage of
their children before they were born went so far, that Shumse ad
Deen concluded by threatening: "Were I not to-morrow," said he,
"to attend the sultan, I would treat you as you deserve; but at
my return, I will make you sensible that it does not become a
younger brother to speak so insolently to his elder as you have
done to me." Upon this he retired to his apartment in anger.</p>

<p id="id00818">Shumse ad Deen rising early next morning, attended the sultan,
who went to hunt near the pyramids. As for Noor ad Deen, he was
very uneasy all night, and supposing it would not be possible to
live longer with a brother who had treated him with so much
haughtiness, he provided a stout mule, furnished himself with
money and jewels, and having told his people that he was going on
a private journey for two or three days, departed.</p>

<p id="id00819">When out of Cairo, he rode by way of the desert towards Arabia;
but his mule happening to tire, was forced to continue his
journey on foot. A courier who was going to Bussorah, by good
fortune overtaking him, took him up behind him. As soon as the
courier reached that city, Noor ad Deen alighted, and returned
him thanks for his kindness. As he went about to seek for a
lodging, he saw a person of quality with a numerous retinue, to
whom all the people shewed the greatest respect, and stood still
till he had passed. This personage was grand vizier, to the
sultan of Bussorah, who was passing through the city to see that
the inhabitants kept good order and discipline.</p>

<p id="id00820">This minister casting his eyes by chance on Noor ad Deen Ali,
perceiving something extraordinary in his aspect, looked very
attentively upon him, and as he saw him in a traveller's habit,
stopped his train, asked him who he was, and from whence he came?
"Sir," said Noor ad Deen, "I am an Egyptian, born at Cairo, and
have left my country, because of the unkindness of a near
relation, resolved to travel through the world, and rather to die
than return home." The grand vizier, who was a good-natured man,
after hearing these words, said to him, "Son, beware; do not
pursue your design; you are not sensible of the hardships you
must endure. Follow me; I may perhaps make you forget the
misfortunes which have forced you to leave your own country."</p>

<p id="id00821">Noor ad Deen followed the grand vizier, who soon discovered his
good qualities, and conceived for him so great an affection, that
one day he said to him in private, "My son, I am, as you see, so
far gone in years, that it is not probable I shall live much
longer. Heaven has bestowed on me only one daughter, who is as
beautiful as you are handsome, and now fit for marriage. Several
nobles of the highest rank at this court have sought her for
their sons, but I would not grant their request. I have an
affection for you, and think you so worthy to be received into my
family, that, preferring you before all those who have demanded
her, I am ready to accept you for my son-in-law. If you like the
proposal, I will acquaint the sultan my master that I have
adopted you by this marriage, and intreat him to grant you the
reversion of my dignity of grand vizier in the kingdom of
Bussorah. In the mean time, nothing being more requisite for me
than ease in my old age, I will not only put you in possession of
great part of my estate, but leave the administration of public
affairs to your management."</p>

<p id="id00822">When the grand vizier had concluded this kind and generous
proposal, Noor ad Deen fell at his feet, and expressing himself
in terms that demonstrated his joy and gratitude, assured him,
that he was at his command in every way. Upon this the vizier
sent for his chief domestics, ordered them to adorn the great
hall of his palace, and prepare a splendid feast. He afterwards
sent to invite the nobility of the court and city, to honour him
with their company; and when they were all met (Noor ad Deen
having made known his quality), he said to the noblemen present,
for he thought it proper to speak thus on purpose to satisfy
those to whom he had refused his alliance, "I am now, my lords,
to discover a circumstance which hitherto I have keep a secret. I
have a brother, who is grand vizier to the sultan of Egypt. This
brother has but one son, whom he would not marry in the court of
Egypt, but sent him hither to wed my daughter in order that both
branches of our family may be united. His son, whom I knew to be
my nephew as soon as I saw him, is the young man I now present to
you as my son-in-law. I hope you will do me the honour to be
present at his wedding, which I am resolved to celebrate this
day." The noblemen, who could not be offended at his preferring
his nephew to the great matches that had been proposed, allowed
that he had very good reason for his choice, were willing to be
witnesses to the ceremony, and wished that God might prolong his
days to enjoy the satisfaction of the happy match.</p>

<p id="id00823">The lords met at the vizier of Bussorah's palace, having
testified their satisfaction at the marriage of his daughter with
Noor ad Deen Ali, sat down to a magnificent repast, after which,
notaries came in with the marriage contrast, and the chief lords
signed it; and when the company had departed, the grand vizier
ordered his servants to have every thing in readiness for Noor ad
Deen Ali, to bathe. He had fine new linen, and rich vestments
provided for him in the greatest profusion. Having bathed and
dressed, he was perfumed with the most odoriferous essences, and
went to compliment the vizier, his father-in-law, who was
exceedingly pleased with his noble demeanour. Having made him sit
down, "My son," said he, "you have declared to me who you are,
and the office you held at the court of Egypt. You have also told
me of a difference betwixt you and your brother, which occasioned
you to leave your country. I desire you to make me your entire
confidant, and to acquaint me with the cause of your quarrel; for
now you have no reason either to doubt my affection, or to
conceal any thing from me."</p>

<p id="id00824">Noor ad Deen informed him of every circumstance of the quarrel; at
which the vizier, burst out into a fit of laughter, and said, "This is
one of the strangest occurrences I ever heard. Is it possible, my son,
that your quarrel should rise so high about an imaginary marriage? I
am sorry you fell out with your elder brother upon such a frivolous
matter; but he was also wrong in being angry at what you only spoke in
jest, and I ought to thank heaven for that difference which has
procured me such a son-in-law. But," continued the vizier, "it is
late, and time for you to retire; go to your bride, my son, she
expects you: to-morrow, I will present you to the sultan, and hope he
will receive you in such a manner as shall satisfy us both." Noor ad
Deen Ali took leave of his father-in-law, and retired to his bridal
apartment.</p>

<p id="id00825">It is remarkable that Shumse ad Deen Mahummud happened also to
marry at Cairo the very same day that this marriage was
solemnized at Bussorah, the particulars of which are as follow:</p>

<p id="id00826">After Noor ad Deen Ali left Cairo, with an intention never to
return, his elder brother, who was hunting with the sultan of
Egypt, was absent for a month; for the sultan being fond of the
chase, continued it often for so long a period. At his return,
Shumse ad Deen was much surprised when he understood, that under
presence of taking a short journey his brother departed from
Cairo on a mule the same day as the sultan, and had never
appeared since. It vexed him so much the more, because he did not
doubt but the harsh words he had used had occasioned his flight.
He sent a messenger in search of him, who went to Damascus, and
as far as Aleppo, but Noor ad Deen was then at Bussorah. When the
courier returned and brought no news of him, Shumse ad Deen
intended to make further inquiry after him in other parts; but in
the meantime matched with the daughter of one of the greatest
lords in Cairo, upon the same day in which his brother married
the daughter of the grand vizier, of Bussorah.</p>

<p id="id00827">At the end of nine months the wife of Shumse ad Deen was brought<br/>

to bed of a daughter at Cairo, and on the same day the lady of<br/>

Noor ad Deen was delivered of a son at Bussorah, who was called<br/>

Buddir ad Deen Houssun.<br/></p>

<p id="id00828">The grand vizier, of Bussorah testified his joy for the birth of
his grandson by gifts and public entertainments. And to shew his
son-in-law the great esteem he had for him, he went to the
palace, and most humbly besought the sultan to grant Noor ad Deen
Ali his office, that he might have the comfort before his death
to see his son in-law made grand vizier, in his stead.</p>

<p id="id00829">The sultan, who had conceived a distinguished regard for Noor ad
Deen when the vizier, had presensed him upon his marriage, and
had ever since heard every body speak well of him, readily
granted his father-in-law's request, and caused Noor ad Deen
immediately to be invested with the robe and insignia of the
vizarut, such as state drums, standards, and writing apparatus of
gold richly enamelled and set with jewels.</p>

<p id="id00830">The next day, when the father saw his son-in-law preside in
council, as he himself had done, and perform all the offices of
grand vizier, his joy was complete. Noor ad Deen Ali conducted
himself with that dignity and propriety which shewed him to have
been used to state affairs, and engaged the approbation of the
sultan, and reverence and affection of the people.</p>

<p id="id00831">The old vizier of Bussorah died about four years afterwards with
great satisfaction, seeing a branch of his family that promised
so fair to support its future consequence and respectability.</p>

<p id="id00832">Noor ad Deen Ali, performed his last duty to him with all
possible love and gratitude. And as soon as his son Buddir ad
Deen Houssun had attained the age of seven years, provided him an
excellent tutor, who taught him such things as became his birth.
The child had a ready wit, and a genius capable of receiving all
the good instructions that could be given.</p>

<p id="id00833">After Buddir ad Deen had been two years under the tuition of his
master, who taught him perfectly to read, he learnt the Koran by
heart. His father put him afterwards to other tutors, by whom his
mind was cultivated to such a degree, that when he was twelve
years of age he had no more occasion for them. And then, as his
physiognomy promised wonders, he was admired by all who saw him.</p>

<p id="id00834">Hitherto his father had kept him to study, but now he introduced
him to the sultan, who received him graciously. The people who
saw him in the streets were charmed with his demeanour, and gave
him a thousand blessings.</p>

<p id="id00835">His father proposing to render him capable of supplying his
place, accustomed him to business of the greatest moment, on
purpose to qualify him betimes. In short, he omitted nothing to
advance a son he loved so well. But as he began to enjoy the
fruits of his labour, he was suddenly seized by a violent fit of
sickness; and finding himself past recovery, disposed himself to
die a good Mussulmaun.</p>

<p id="id00836">In that last and precious moment he forgot not his son, but
called for him, and said, "My son, you see this world is
transitory; there is nothing durable but in that to which I shall
speedily go. You must therefore from henceforth begin to fit
yourself for this change, as I have done; you must prepare for it
without murmuring, so as to have no trouble of conscience for not
having acted the part of a really honest man. As for your
religion, you are sufficiently instructed in it, by what you have
learnt from your tutors, and your own study; and as to what
belongs to an upright man, I shall give you some instructions, of
which I hope you will make good use. As it is a necessary thing
to know one's self, and you cannot come to that knowledge without
you first understand who I am, I shall now inform you.</p>

<p id="id00837">"I am a native of Egypt; my father, your grandfather, was first
minister to the sultan of that kingdom. I had myself the honour
to be vizier, to that sultan, and so has my brother, your uncle,
who I suppose is yet alive; his name is Shumse ad Deen Mahummud.
I was obliged to leave him, and come into this country, where I
have raised myself to the high dignity I now enjoy. But you will
understand all these matters more fully by a manuscript that I
shall give you."</p>

<p id="id00838">At the same time, Noor ad Deen Ali gave to his son a memorandum
book, saying, "Take and read it at your leisure; you will find,
among other things, the day of my marriage, and that of your
birth. These are circumstances which perhaps you may hereafter
have occasion to know, therefore you must keep it very
carefully."</p>

<p id="id00839">Buddir ad Deen Houssun being sincerely afflicted to see his
father in this condition, and sensibly touched with his
discourse, could not but weep when he received the memorandum
book, and promised at the same time never to part with it.</p>

<p id="id00840">That very moment Noor ad Deen fainted, so that it was thought he
would have expired; but he came to himself again, and spoke as
follows:</p>

<p id="id00841">"My son, the first instruction I give you, is, Not to make
yourself familiar with all sorts of people. The way to live happy
is to keep your mind to yourself, and not to tell your thoughts
too easily.</p>

<p id="id00842">"Secondly, Not to do violence to any body whatever, for in that
case you will draw every body's hatred upon you. You ought to
consider the world as a creditor, to whom you owe moderation,
compassion, and forbearance.</p>

<p id="id00843">"Thirdly, Not to say a word when you are reproached; for, as the
proverb says, 'He that keeps silence is out of danger.' And in
this case particularly you ought to practice it. You also know
what one of our poets says upon this subject, 'That silence is
the ornament and safe-guard of life'; That our speech ought not
to be like a storm of hail that spoils all. Never did any man yet
repent of having spoken too little, whereas many have been sorry
that they spoke so much.</p>

<p id="id00844">"Fourthly, To drink no wine, for that is the source of all vices.</p>

<p id="id00845">"Fifthly, To be frugal in your way of living; if you do not
squander your estate, it will maintain you in time of necessity.
I do not mean you should be either profuse or niggardly; for
though you have little, if you husband it well, and lay it out on
proper occasions, you will have many friends; but if on the
contrary you have great riches, and make but a bad use of them,
all the world will forsake you, and leave you to yourself."</p>

<p id="id00846">In short, the virtuous Noor ad Deen continued till the last
aspiration of his breath to give good advice to his son; and when
he was dead he was magnificently interred.</p>

<p id="id00847">Noor ad Deen was buried with all the honours due to his rank.
Buddir ad Deen Houssun of Bussorah, for so he was called, because
born in that city, was with grief for the death of his father,
that instead of a month's time to mourn, according to custom, he
kept himself shut up in tears and solitude about two months,
without seeing any body, or so much as going abroad to pay his
duty to his sovereign. The sultan being displeased at his
neglect, and looking upon it as a alight, suffered his passion to
prevail, and in his anger, called for the new grand vizier, (for
he had created another on the death of Noor ad Deen), commanded
him to go to the house of the deceased, and seize upon it, with
all his other houses, lands, and effects, without leaving any
thing for Buddir ad Deen Houssun, and to confine his person.</p>

<p id="id00848">The new grand vizier, accompanied by his officers, went
immediately to execute his commission. But one of Buddir ad Deen
Houssun's slaves happening accidentally to come into the crowd,
no sooner understood the vizier's errand, than he ran before to
give his master warning. He found him sitting in the vestibule of
his house, as melancholy as if his father had been but newly
dead. He fell down at his feet out of breath, and alter he had
kissed the hem of his garment, cried out, "My lord, save yourself
immediately." The unfortunate youth lifting up his head,
exclaimed, "What news dost thou bring?" "My lord," said he,
"there is no time to be lost; the sultan is incensed against you,
has sent to confiscate your estates, and to seize your person."</p>

<p id="id00849">The words of this faithful and affectionate slave occasioned
Buddir ad Deen Houssun great alarm. "May not I have so much
time," said he, "as to take some money and jewels along with me?"
"No, Sir," replied the slave, "the grand vizier, will be here
this moment; be gone immediately, save yourself." The unhappy
youth rose hastily from his sofa, put his feet in his sandals,
and after he had covered his head with the skirt of his vest,
that his face might not be known, fled, without knowing what way
to go, to avoid the impending danger.</p>

<p id="id00850">He ran without stopping till he came to the public burying-ground, and
as it was growing dark, resolved to pass that night in his father's
tomb. It was a large edifice, covered by a dome, which Noor ad Deen
Ali, as is common with the Mussulmauns, had erected for his sepulture.
On the way Buddir ad Deen met a Jew, who was a banker and merchant,
and was returning from a place where his affairs had called him, to
the city.</p>

<p id="id00851">The Jew, knowing Buddir ad Deen, stopped, and saluted him very
courteously.</p>

<p id="id00852">Isaac the Jew, after he had paid his respects to Buddir ad Deen
Houssun, by kissing his hand, said, "My lord, dare I be so bold
as to ask whither you are going at this time of night alone, and
so much troubled? Has any thing disquieted you?" "Yes," said
Buddir ad Deen, "a while ago I was asleep, and my father appeared
to me in a dream, looking very fiercely upon me, as if much
displeased. I started out of my sleep in alarm, and came out
immediately to go and pray upon his tomb."</p>

<p id="id00853">"My lord," said the Jew (who did not know the true reason why
Buddir ad Deen had left the town), "your father of happy memory,
and my good lord, had store of merchandize in several vessels,
which are yet at sea, and belong to you; I beg the favour of you
to grant me the refusal of them before any other merchant. I am
able to pay down ready money for all the goods that are in your
ships: and to begin, if you will give me those that happen to
come in the first that arrives in safety, I will pay you down in
part of payment a thousand sequins," and drawing out a bag from
under his vest, he shewed it him sealed up with one seal.</p>

<p id="id00854">Buddir ad Deen Houssun being banished from home, and dispossessed
of all that he had in the world, looked on this proposal of the
Jew as a favour from heaven, and therefore accepted it with joy.
"My lord," said the Jew, "then you sell me for a thousand sequins
the lading of the first of your ships that shall arrive in port?"
"Yes," answered Buddir ad Deen, "I sell it to you for a thousand
sequins; it is done." Upon this the Jew delivered him the bag of
a thousand sequins, and offered to count them, but Buddir ad Deen
said he would trust his word. "Since it is so, my lord," said he,
"be pleased to favour me with a small note of the bargain we have
made." As he spoke, he pulled the inkhorn from his girdle, and
taking a small reed out of it neatly cut for writing, presented
it to him with a piece of paper. Buddir ad Deen Houssun wrote
these words:</p>

<p id="id00855">"This writing is to testify, that Buddir ad Deen Houssun of
Bussorah, has sold to Isaac the Jew, for the sum of one thousand
sequins, received in hand, the lading of the first of his ships
that shall arrive in this port."</p>

<p id="id00856">This note he delivered to the Jew, after having stamped it with
his seal, and then took his leave of him.</p>

<p id="id00857">While Isaac pursued his journey to the city, Buddir ad Deen made
the best of his way to his father's tomb. When he came to it, he
prostrated himself to the ground, and, with his eyes full of
tears, deplored his miserable condition. "Alas!" said he,
"unfortunate Buddir ad Deen, what will become of thee? Whither
canst thou fly for refuge against the unjust prince who
persecutes thee? Was it not enough to be afflicted by the death
of so dear a father? Must fortune needs add new misfortunes to
just complaints?" He continued a long time in this posture, but
at last rose up, and leaning his head upon his father's
tombstone, his sorrows returned more violently than before; so
that he sighed and mourned, till, overcome with heaviness, he
sunk upon the floor, and drops asleep.</p>

<p id="id00858">He had not slept long, when a genie, who had retired to the
cemetery during the day, and was intending, according to his
custom, to range about the world at night, entered the sepulchre,
and finding Buddir ad Deen lying on his back, was surprised at
his beauty.</p>

<p id="id00859">When the genie had attentively considered Buddir ad Deen Houssun,
he said to himself, "To judge of this creature by his beauty, he
would seem to be an angel of the terrestrial paradise, whom God
has sent to put the world in a flame by his charms." At last,
after he had satisfied himself with looking at him, he tool; a
flight into the air, where meeting by chance with a perie, they
saluted one another; after which he said to her, "Pray descend
with me into the cemetery, where I dwell, and I will shew you a
beauty worthy your admiration." The perie consented, and both
descended in an instant; they came into the tomb. "Look," said
the genie, shewing her Buddir ad Deen Houssun, "did you ever see
a youth more beautiful?"</p>

<p id="id00860">The perie having attentively observed Buddir ad Deen, replied, "I
must confess that he is a very handsome man, but I am just come
from seeing an objets at Cairo, more admirable than this; and if
you will hear me, I will relate her unhappy fate." "You will very
much oblige me," answered the genie. "You must know then," said
the perie, "that the sultan of Egypt has a vizier, Shumse ad Deen
Mahummud, who has a daughter most beautiful and accomplished. The
sultan having heard of this young lady's beauty, sent the other
day for her father, and said, 'I understand you have a daughter
to marry; I would have her for my bride: will not you consent?'
The vizier, who did not expect this proposal, was troubled, and
instead of accepting it joyfully, which another in his place
would certainly have done, he answered the sultan: 'May it please
your majesty, I am not worthy of the honour you would confer upon
me, and I most humbly beseech you to pardon me, if I do not
accede to your request. You know I had a brother, who had the
honour, as well as myself, to be one of your viziers: we had some
difference together, which was the cause of his leaving me
suddenly. Since that time I have had no account of him till
within these four days, that I heard he died at Bussorah, being
grand vizier to the sultan of that kingdom.</p>

<p id="id00861">"'He has left a son, and there having been an agreement between
us to match our children together, I am persuaded he intended
that match when he died; and being desirous to fulfil the promise
on my part, I conjure your majesty to grant me permission.'</p>

<p id="id00862">"The sultan of Egypt, provoked at this denial of his vizier said
to him in anger which he could not restrain: 'Is this the way in
which you requite my condescension in stooping so low as to
desire your alliance? I know how to revenge your presumption in
daring to prefer another to me, and I swear that your daughter
shall be married to the most contemptible and ugly of my slaves.'
Having thus spoken, he angrily commanded the vizier to quit his
presence. The vizier retired to his palace full of confusion, and
overwhelmed in despair.</p>

<p id="id00863">"This very day the sultan sent for one of his grooms, who is
hump-backed, big-bellied, crook legged, and as ugly as a
hobgoblin; and after having commanded the vizier to marry his
daughter to this ghastly slave, he caused the contract to be made
and signed by witnesses in his own presence. The preparations for
this fantastical wedding are all ready, and this very moment all
the slaves belonging to the lords of the court of Egypt are
waiting at the door of a bath, each with a flambeau in his hand,
for the crook-back groom, who is bathing, to go along with them
to his bride, who is already dressed to receive him; and when I
departed from Cairo, the ladies met for that purpose were going
to conduct her in her nuptial attire to the hall, where she is to
receive her hump-backed bridegroom, and is this minute expecting
him. I have seen her, and do assure you, that no person can
behold her without admiration."</p>

<p id="id00864">When the perie left off speaking, the genie said to her, "Whatever you
think or say, I cannot be persuaded that the girl's beauty exceeds
that of this young man." "I will not dispute it with you," answered
the perie; "for I must confess he deserves to be married to that
charming creature, whom they design for hump-back; and I think it were
a deed worthy of us to obstruct the sultan of Egypt's injustice, and
put this young gentleman in the room of the slave." "You are in the
right," answered the genie; "I am extremely obliged to you for so good
a thought; let us deceive him. I consent to your revenge upon the
sultan of Egypt; let us comfort a distressed father, and make his
daughter as happy as she thinks herself miserable. I will do my utmost
endeavours to make this project succeed, and I am persuaded you will
not be backward. I will be at the pains to carry him to Cairo before
he awakes, and afterwards leave it to your care to carry him
elsewhere, when we have accomplished our design."</p>

<p id="id00865">The perie and the genie having thus concerted what they had to do, the
genie lifted up Buddir ad Deen Houssun gently, and with an
inconceivable swiftness conveyed him through the air and set him down
at the door of a building next to the bath, whence hump-back was to
come with a train of slaves that waited for him. Buddir ad Deen awoke,
and was naturally alarmed at finding himself in the middle of a city
he knew not; he was going to cry out, but the genie touched him gently
on the shoulder, and forbad him to speak. He then put a torch in his
hand, saying, "Go, and mix with the crowd at the door of the bath;
follow them till you come into a hall, where they are going to
celebrate a marriage. The bridegroom is a hump-backed fellow, and by
that you will easily know him. Put yourself at the right hand as you
go in, open the purse of sequins you have in your bosom, distribute
them among the musicians and dancers as they go along; and when you
are got into the hall, give money also to the female slaves you see
about the bride; but every time you put your hand in your purse, be
sure to take out a whole handful, and do not spare them. Observe to do
everything exactly as I have desired you; be not afraid of any person,
and leave the rest to a superior power, who will order matters as he
thinks fit."</p>

<p id="id00866">Buddir ad Deen, being well instructed in all that he was to do,
advanced towards the door of the bath. The first thing he did was
to light his torch at that of a slave; and then mixing among them
as if he belonged to some noblemen of Cairo, he marched along as
they did, and followed humpback, who came out of the bath, and
mounted a horse from the sultan's own stable.</p>

<p id="id00867">Buddir ad Deen coming near to the musicians, and men and women
dancers, who went just before the bridegroom, pulled out time
after time whole handfuls of sequins, which he distributed among
them: and as he thus gave his money with an unparalleled grace
and engaging mien, all who received it fixed their eyes upon him;
and after they had a full view of his face, they found him so
handsome that they could not withdraw their attention.</p>

<p id="id00868">At last they came to the gates of the vizier who little thought
his nephew was so near. The doorkeepers, to prevent any disorder,
kept back all the slaves that carried torches, and would not
admit them. Buddir ad Deen was likewise refused; but the
musicians, who had free entrance, stood still, and protested they
would not go in, if they hindered him from accompanying them. "He
is not one of the slaves'" said they; "look upon him, and you
will soon be satisfied. He is certainly a young stranger, who is
curious to see the ceremonies observed at marriages in this
city;" and saying thus, they put him in the midst of them, and
carried him with them in spite of the porters. They took his
torch out of his hand, gave it to the first they met, and having
brought him into the hall, placed him at the right hand of the
hump-backed bridegroom, who sat near the vizier's daughter on a
throne most richly adorned.</p>

<p id="id00869">She appeared very lovely, but in her face there was nothing to be
seen but vexation and grief. The cause of this was easily to be
guessed, when she had by her side a bridegroom so very deformed,
and so unworthy of her love. The nuptial seat was in the midst of
an estrade. The ladies of the emirs, viziers, those of the
sultan's bed-chamber, and several other ladies of the court and
city, were placed on each side, a little lower, every one
according to her rank, and richly dressed, holding a large wax
taper in her hands.</p>

<p id="id00870">When they saw Buddir ad Deen Houssun, all fixed their eyes upon
him, and admiring his shape, his behaviour, and the beauty of his
face, they could not forbear looking upon him. When he was seated
every one deft their seats, came near him to have a full view of
his face, and all found themselves moved with love and
admiration.</p>

<p id="id00871">The disparity between Buddir ad Deen Houssun and the hump-backed
groom, who made such a contemptible figure, occasioned great
murmuring among the company; insomuch that the ladies cried out,
"We must give our bride to this handsome young gentleman, and not
to this ugly humpback." Nor did they rest here, but uttered
imprecations against the sultan, who, abusing his absolute power,
would unite ugliness and beauty together. They also mocked the
bridegroom, so as to put him out of countenance, to the great
satisfaction of the spectators, whose shouts for some time put a
stop to the concert of music in the hall. At last the musicians
began again, and the women who had dressed the bride surrounded
her.</p>

<p id="id00872">Each time that the bride retired to change her dress, she on her
return passed by hump-back without giving him one look, and went
towards Buddir ad Deen, before whom she presented herself in her
new attire. On this occasion, Buddir ad Deen, according to the
instructions given him by the genie, failed not to put his hands
in his purse, and pulled out handfuls of sequins, which he
distributed among the women that followed the bride. Nor did he
forget the players and dancers, but also threw money to them. It
was pleasant to see how they pushed one another to gather it up.
They shewed themselves thankful for his liberality.</p>

<p id="id00873">When the ceremony of changing habits was passed, the music ceased
and the company retired. The bride repaired to the nuptial
chamber, whither her attendants followed to undress her, and none
remained in the hall but the hump-back groom, Buddir ad Deen, and
some of the domestics.</p>

<p id="id00874">Hump-back, who was enraged at Buddir ad Deen, suspecting him to
be his rival, gave him a cross look, and said, "And thou, what
dost thou wait for? Why art thou not gone as well as the rest?
Depart!" Buddir ad Deen having no pretence to stay, withdrew, not
knowing what to do with himself. But before he got out of the
vestibule, the genie and the perie met and stopped him. "Whither
are you going?" said the perie; "stay, hump-back is not in the
hall, return, and introduce yourself into the bride's chamber. As
soon as you are alone with her, tell her boldly that you are her
husband, that the sultan's intention was only to make sport with
the groom. In the mean time we will take care that the hump-back
shall not return, and let nothing hinder your passing the night
with your bride, for she is yours and not his."</p>

<p id="id00875">While the perie thus encouraged Buddir ad Deen, and instructed
him how he should behave himself, hump-back had really gone out
of the room for a moment. The genie went to him in the shape of a
monstrous cat, mewing at a most fearful rate. Hump-back called to
the cat, he clapped his hands to drive her away, but instead of
retreating, she stood upon her hinder feet, staring with her eyes
like fire, looking fiercely at him, mewing louder than she did at
first, and increasing in size till she was as large as an ass. At
this sight, hump-back would have cried out for help, but his fear
was so great, that he stood gaping and could not utter one word.
That he might have no time to recover, the genie changed himself
immediately into a large buffalo, and in this stripe called to
him, with a voice that redoubled his fear, "Thou hump-backed
villain!" At these words the affrighted groom cast himself upon
the ground, and covering his face with his vest, that he might
not see this dreadful beast, "Sovereign prince of buffaloes,"
said he, "what is it you want of me?" "Woe be to thee," replied
the genie, "hast thou the presumption to venture to marry my
mistress?" "O my lord," said hump-back, "I pray you to pardon me,
if I am guilty, it is through ignorance. I did not know that this
lady had a buffalo to her sweetheart: command me in anything you
please, I give you my oath that I am ready to obey you." "By
death," replied the genie; "if thou goest out from hence, or
speakest a word till the sun rises, I will crush thy head to
pieces. I warn thee to obey, for if thou hast the impudence to
return, it shall cost thee thy life." When the genie had done
speaking, he transformed himself into the shape of a man, took
hump-back by the legs, and after having set him against the wall
with his head downwards, "If thou stir," said he, "before the sun
rise, as I have told thee already, I will take thee by the heels
again, and dash thy head in a thousand pieces against the wall."</p>

<p id="id00876">To return to Buddir ad Deen. Prompted by the genie and the
presence of the perie, he returned to the hall, from whence he
slips into the bride-chamber, where he sat down, expecting the
success of his adventure. After a while the bride arrived,
conducted by an old matron, who came no farther than the door,
without looking in to see whether it were hump-back or another
that was there, and then retired.</p>

<p id="id00877">The beautiful bride was agreeably surprised to find instead of
hump-back a handsome youth, who gracefully addressed her. "What!
my dear friend," said she, "by your being here at this time of
night you must be my husband's comrade?" "No, madam," said Buddir
ad Deen, "I am of another quality than that ugly hump-back."
"But," said she, "you do not consider that you speak degradingly
of my husband." "He your husband," replied he: "can you retain
those thoughts so long? Be convinced of your mistake, for so much
beauty must never be sacrificed to the most contemptible of
mankind. It is I that am the happy mortal for whom it is
reserved. The sultan had a mind to make himself merry, by putting
this trick upon the vizier your father, but he chose me to be
your real husband. You might have observed how the ladies, the
musicians, the dancers, your women, and all the servants of your
family, were pleased with this comedy. We have sent hump-back to
his stable again."</p>

<p id="id00878">At this discourse the vizier's daughter (who was more like one
dead than alive when she came into the bride-chamber) put on a
gay air, which made her so handsome, that Buddir ad Deen was
charmed with her graces.</p>

<p id="id00879">"I did not expect," said she, "to meet with so pleasing a
surprise; and I had condemned myself to live unhappy all my days.
But my good fortune is so much the greater, that I possess in you
a man worthy of my tenderest affection."</p>

<p id="id00880">Buddir ad Deen, overjoyed to see himself possessor of so many
charms, retired with his bride, and laid his vesture aside, with
the bag that he had from the Jew; which, notwithstanding all the
money he had dispersed, was still full.</p>

<p id="id00881">Towards morning, while the two lovers were asleep, the genie, who had
met again with the perie, said, "It is time to finish what we have so
successfully carried on; let us not be overtaken by day-light, which
will soon appear; go you and bring off the young man again without
awaking him."</p>

<p id="id00882">The perie went into the bed-chamber where the two lovers were
fast asleep, took up Buddir ad Deen in his under vest and
drawers; and in company with the genie with wonderful swiftness
fled away with him to the gates of Damascus in Syria, where they
arrived just at the time when the officers of the mosques,
appointed for that end, were calling the people to prayers at
break of day. The perie laid Buddir ad Deen softly on the ground,
close by the gate, and departed with the genie.</p>

<p id="id00883">The gate of the city being opened, and many people assembled,
they were surprised to see a youth lying in his shirt and drawers
upon the ground. One said, "He has been hard put to it to get
away from his mistress, that he could not get time to put on his
clothes." "Look," said another, "how people expose themselves;
sure enough he has spent most part of the night in drinking with
his friends, till he has got drunk, and then, perhaps, having
occasion to go out, instead of returning, is come this length,
and not having his senses about him, was overtaken with sleep."
Others were of another opinion; but nobody could guess what had
been the real occasion of his coming thither.</p>

<p id="id00884">A small puff of wind happening to blow at this time, uncovered
his breast, which was whiter than snow. Every one being struck
with admiration at the fineness of his complexion, they spoke so
loud that they awaked him.</p>

<p id="id00885">His surprise was as great as theirs, when he found himself at the
gate of a city where he had never been before, and encompassed by
a crowd of people gazing at him. "Inform me," said he, "for God's
sake, where I am, and what you would have?" One of the crowd
spoke to him saying, "Young man, the gates of the city were just
now opened, and as we came out we found you lying here in this
condition: have you lain here all night? and do not you know that
you are at one of the gates of Damascus?" "At one of the gates of
Damascus!" answered Buddir ad Deen, "surely you mock me. When I
lay down to sleep last night I was at Cairo." When he had said
this, some of the people, moved with compassion for him,
exclaimed, "It is a pity that such a handsome young man should
have lost his senses;" and so went away.</p>

<p id="id00886">"My son," said an old man to him, "you know not what you say. How
is it possible that you, being this morning at Damascus, could be
last night at Cairo?" "It is true," said Buddir ad Deen, "and I
swear to you, that I was all day yesterday at Bussorah." He had
no sooner said this than all the people fell into a fit of
laughter, and cried out, "He's a fool, he's a madman." There were
some, however, that pitied him because of his youth; and one
among the company said to him, "My son, you must certainly be
crazed, you do not consider what you say. Is it possible that a
man could yesterday be at Bussorah, the same night at Cairo, and
this morning at Damascus? Surely you are asleep still, come rouse
up your spirits." "What I say," answered Buddir ad Deen Houssun,
"is so true that last night I was married in the city of Cairo."
All those who laughed before, could not forbear again at this
declaration. "Recollect yourself," said the same person who spoke
before; "you must have dreamt all this, and the fancy still
possesses your brain." "I am sensible of what I say," answered
the young man. "Pray can you tell me how it was possible for me
to go in a dream to Cairo, where I am very certain I was in
person, and where my bride was seven times brought before me,
each time dressed in a different habit, and where I saw an ugly
hump backed fellow, to whom they intended to give her? Besides, I
want to know what is become of my vest, my turban, and the bag of
sequins I had at Cairo?"</p>

<p id="id00887">Though he assured them that all these things were matters of
fact, yet they could not forbear to laugh at him: which put him
into such confusion, that he knew not what to think of all those
adventures.</p>

<p id="id00888">After Buddir ad Deen Houssun had confidently affirmed all that he
said to be true, he rose up to go into the town, and every one
who followed him called out, "A madman, a fool." Upon this some
looked out at their windows, some came to their doors, and others
joined with those that were about him, calling out as they did,
"A madman;" but not knowing for what. In this perplexity the
affrighted young man happened to come before a pastry-cook's
shop, and went into it to avoid the rabble.</p>

<p id="id00889">This pastry-cook had formerly been captain to a troop of Arabian
robbers, who plundered the caravans; and though he was become a
citizen of Damascus, where he behaved himself to every one's
satisfaction, yet he was dreaded by all who knew him; wherefore,
as soon as he came out to the rabble who followed Buddir ad Deen,
they dispersed.</p>

<p id="id00890">The pastry-cook asked him who he was, and what brought him
thither. Buddir ad Deen told him all, not concealing his birth,
nor the death of his father the grand vizier. He afterwards gave
him an account why he had left Bussorah; how, after he had fallen
asleep the night following upon his father's tomb, he found
himself when he awoke at Cairo, where he had married a lady; and
at last, in what amazement he was, when he found himself at
Damascus, without being able to penetrate into all those
wonderful adventures.</p>

<p id="id00891">"Your history is one of the most surprising," said the pastry-cook;
"but if you will follow my advice, you will let no man know those
matters you have revealed to me, but patiently wait till heaven thinks
fit to put an end to your misfortunes. You shall be welcome to stay
with me till then; and as I have no children, I will own you for my
son, if you consent; after you are so adopted, you may freely walk the
city, without being exposed any more to the insults of the rabble."</p>

<p id="id00892">Though this adoption was below the son of a grand vizier, Buddir ad
Deen was glad to accept of the pastry-cook's proposal, judging it the
best thing he could do, considering his circumstances. The cook
clothed him, called for witnesses, and went before a notary, where he
acknowledged him for his son. After this, Buddir ad Deen lived with
him under the name of Houssun, and learned the pastry-trade.</p>

<p id="id00893">While this passed at Damascus, the daughter of Shumse ad Deen
awoke, and finding Buddir ad Deen gone, supposed he had risen
softly for fear of disturbing her, but would soon return. As she
was in expectation of him, her father the vizier, (who was vexed
at the affront put upon him by the sultan) came and knocked at
her chamber-door, to bewail her sad destiny. He called her by her
name, and she knowing him by his voice, immediately got up, and
opened the door. She kissed his hand, and received him with so
much pleasure in her countenance, that she surprised the vizier
who expected to find her drowned in tears, and as much grieved as
himself. "Unhappy wretch!" said he in a passion, "do you appear
before me thus? after the hideous sacrifice you have just
consummated, can you see me with so much satisfaction?"</p>

<p id="id00894">The new bride seeing her father angry at her pleasant
countenance, said to him, "For God's sake, sir, do not reproach
me wrongfully; it is not the hump-back fellow, whom I abhor more
than death, it is not that monster I have married. Every body
laughed him to scorn, and put him so out of countenance, that he
was forced to run away and hide himself, to make room for a noble
youth, who is my real husband." "What fable do you tell me?" said
Shumse ad Deen, roughly. "What! Did not crook-back lie with you
tonight?" "No, sir," said she, "it was the youth I mentioned, who
has large eyes and black eyebrows." At these words the vizier,
lost all patience, and exclaimed in anger, "Ah, wicked woman! you
will make me distracted!" "It is you, father," said she, "that
put me out of my senses by your incredulity." "So, it is not
true," replied the vizier, "that hump-back&#8212;&#8212;" "Let us talk no
more of hump-back," said she, "a curse upon hump-back. Father, I
assure you once more, that I did not bed with him, but with my
dear spouse, who, I believe, is not far off."</p>

<p id="id00895">Shumse ad Deen went out to seek him, but, instead of seeing
Buddir ad Deen, was surprised to find hump-back with his head on
the ground, and his heels uppermost, as the genie had set him
against the wall. "What is the meaning of this?" said he; "who
placed you thus?" Crookback, knowing it to be the vizier
answered, "Alas! alas! it is you then that would marry me to the
mistress of a genie in the form of a buffalo."</p>

<p id="id00896">Shumse ad Deen Mahummud, when he heard hump-back speak thus,
thought he was raving, bade him move, and stand upon his legs. "I
will take care how I stir," said hump-back, "unless the sun be
risen. Know, sir, that when I came last night to your palace,
suddenly a black cat appeared to me, and in an instant grew as
big as a buffalo. I have not forgotten what he enjoined me,
therefore you may depart, and leave me here." The vizier instead
of going away, took him by the heels, and made him stand up, when
hump-back ran off, without looking behind him; and coming to the
palace presented himself to the sultan, who laughed heartily when
informed how the genie had served him.</p>

<p id="id00897">Shumse ad Deen returned to his daughter's chamber, more
astonished than before. "My abused daughter," said he, "can you
give me no farther light in this miraculous affair?" "Sir,"
replied she, "I can give you no other account than I have done
already. Here are my husband's clothes, which he put off last
night; perhaps you may find something among them that may solve
your doubt." She then shewed him Buddir ad Deen's turban, which
he examined narrowly on all sides, saying, "I should take this to
be a vizier's turban, if it were not made after the Bussorah
fashion." But perceiving something to be sewed between the stuff
and the lining, he called for scissors, and having unripped it,
found the paper which Noor ad Deen Ali had given to his son upon
his deathbed, and which Buddir ad Deen Houssun had sewn in his
turban for security.</p>

<p id="id00898">Shumse ad Deen having opened the paper, knew his brother's hand,
and found this superscription, "For my son Buddir ad Deen
Houssun." Before he could make any reflections upon it, his
daughter delivered him the bag, that lay under the garments,
which he likewise opened, and found it full of sequins: for,
notwithstanding all the liberality of Buddir ad Deen, it was
still kept full by the genie and perie. He read the following
words upon a note in the bag: "A thousand sequins belonging to
Isaac the Jew." And these lines underneath, which the Jew had
written, "Delivered to my lord Buddir ad Deen Houssun, for the
cargo of the first of those ships that formerly belonged to the
noble vizier, his father, of blessed memory, sold to me upon its
arrival in this place." He had scarcely read these words, when he
groaned heavily, and fainted away.</p>

<p id="id00899">The vizier Shumse ad Deen being recovered from his fit by the aid
of his daughter, and the women she called to her assistance;
"Daughter," said he, "do not alarm yourself at this accident,
occasioned by what is scarcely credible. Your bridegroom is your
cousin, the son of my beloved and deceased brother. The thousand
sequins in the bag reminds me of a quarrel I had with him, and is
without the dowry he gives you. God be praised for all things,
and particularly for this miraculous adventure, which
demonstrates his almighty power." Then looking again upon his
brother's writing, he kissed it several times, shedding abundance
of tears.</p>

<p id="id00900">He looked over the book from beginning to end. In it he found the
date of his brother's arrival at Bussorah, of his marriage, and
of the birth of his son; and when he compared them with the day
of his own marriage, and the birth of his daughter at Cairo, he
wondered at the exact coincidence which appeared in every
circumstance.</p>

<p id="id00901">The happy discovery put him into such a transport of joy, that he
took the book, with the ticket of the bag, and shewed them to the
sultan, who pardoned what was past, and was so much pleased with
the relation of this adventure, that he caused it with all its
circumstances to be put in writing for the information of
posterity.</p>

<p id="id00902">Meanwhile, the vizier. Shumse ad Deen could not comprehend the
reason why his nephew did not appear; he expected him every
moment, and was impatient to receive him to his arms. After he
had waited seven days in vain, he searched through all Cairo, but
could procure no intelligence of him, which threw him into great
perplexity. "This is the strangest occurrence," said he, "that
ever happened." In order to certify it, he thought fit to draw up
in writing with his own hand an account of the manner in which
the wedding had been solemnized; how the hall and his daughter's
bed-chamber were furnished, with the other circumstances. He
likewise made the turban, the bag, and the rest of Buddir ad
Deen's raiment into a bundle, and locked them up.</p>

<p id="id00903">After some days were past, the vizier's daughter perceived
herself pregnant, and after nine months was brought to bed of a
son. A nurse was provided for the child, besides other women and
slaves to wait upon him; and his grandfather called him Agib.</p>

<p id="id00904">When young Agib had attained the age of seven, the vizier,
instead of teaching him to read at home, put him to school with a
master who was in great esteem; and two slaves were ordered to
wait upon him. Agib used to play with his schoolfellows, and as
they were all inferior to him in rank, they shewed him great
respect, according to the example of their master, who many times
would pass by faults in him that he would correct in his other
pupils. This indulgence spoiled Agib; he became proud and
insolent, would have his play-fellows bear all from him, and
would submit to nothing from them, but be master every where; and
if any took the liberty to thwart him, he would call them a
thousand names, and many times beat them.</p>

<p id="id00905">In short, all the scholars grew weary of his insolence, and
complained of him to their master. He answered, "That they must
have patience." But when he saw that Agib grew still more and
more overbearing, and occasioned him much trouble, "Children,"
said he to his scholars, "I find Agib is a little insolent
gentleman; I will shew you how to mortify him, so that he shall
never torment you any more. Nay, I believe it will make him leave
the school. When he comes again to-morrow, place yourselves round
him, and let one of you call out, 'Come, let us play, but upon
condition, that every one who desires to play shall tell his own
name, and the names of his father and mother; they who refuse
shall be esteemed bastards, and not be suffered to play in our
company.'"</p>

<p id="id00906">Next day when they were gathered together, they failed not to
follow their master's instructions. They placed themselves round
Agib, and one of them called out, "Let us begin a play, but on
condition that he who cannot tell his own name, and that of his
father and mother, shall not play at all." They all cried out,
and so did Agib, "We consent." Then he that spoke first asked
every one the question, and all fulfilled the condition except
Agib, who answered, "My name is Agib, my mother is called the
lady of beauty, and my father Shumse ad Deen Mahummud, vizier to
the sultan."</p>

<p id="id00907">At these words all the children cried out, "Agib, what do you
say? That is not the name of your father, but your grandfather."
"A curse on you," said he in a passion. "What! dare you say that
the vizier is not my father?" "No, no," cried they with great
laughter, "he is your grandfather, and you shall not play with
us. Nay we will take care how we come into your company." Having
spoken thus, they all left him, scoffing him, and laughing among
themselves, which mortified Agib so much that he wept.</p>

<p id="id00908">The schoolmaster who was near, and heard all that passed, came
up, and speaking to Agib, said, "Agib, do not you know that the
vizier is not your father, but your grandfather, and the father
of your mother the lady of beauty? We know not the name of your
father any more than you do. We only know that the sultan was
going to marry your mother to one of his grooms, a humpback
fellow; but a genie lay with her. This is hard upon you, but
ought to teach you to treat your schoolfellows with less
haughtiness."</p>

<p id="id00909">Agib being nettled at this, ran hastily out of the school. He
went directly sobbing to his mother's chamber, who being alarmed
to see him thus grieved, asked the reason. He could not answer
for tears, so great was his mortification, and it was long ere he
could speak plain enough to repeat what had been said to him, and
had occasioned his sorrow.</p>

<p id="id00910">When he came to himself. "Mother," said he "for the love of God
be pleased to tell me who is my father?" "My son," she replied,
"Shumse ad Deen Mahummud, who every day caresses you so kindly,
is your father." "You do not tell me truth," returned Agib; "he
is your father, and none of mine. But whose son am I?" At this
question, the lady of beauty calling to mind her wedding night,
which had been succeeded by a long widowhood, began to shed
tears, repining bitterly at the loss of so handsome a husband as
Buddir ad Deen.</p>

<p id="id00911">Whilst the lady of beauty and Agib were both weeping, the vizier
entered, who demanded the reason of their sorrow. The lady told
him the shame Agib had undergone at school, which so much
affected the vizier that he joined his tears with theirs, and
judging from this that the misfortune which had happened to his
daughter was the common discourse of the town, he was mortified
to the quick.</p>

<p id="id00912">Being thus afflicted, he went to the sultan's palace, and falling
prostrate at his feet, most humbly intreated permission to make a
journey in search of his nephew Buddir ad Deen Houssun. For he
could not bear any longer that the people of the city should
believe a genie had disgraced his daughter.</p>

<p id="id00913">The sultan was much concerned at the vizier's affliction,
approved his resolution, and gave him leave to travel. He caused
a passport also to be written for him, requesting in the
strongest terms all kings and princes in whose dominions Buddir
ad Deen might sojourn, to grant that the vizier might conduct him
to Cairo.</p>

<p id="id00914">Shumse ad Deen, not knowing how to express his gratitude to the
sultan, fell down before him a second time, while the floods of
tears he shed bore sufficient testimony to his feelings. At last,
having wished the sultan all manner of prosperity, he took his
leave and returned to his house, where he disposed every thing
for his journey; and the preparations were carried on with so
much diligence, that in four days after he left the city,
accompanied with his daughter the lady of beauty, and his
grandson Agib.</p>

<p id="id00915">They travelled nineteen days without intermission; but on the
twentieth, arriving at a pleasant mead, a small distance from the
gate of Damascus, they halted, and pitched their tents upon the
banks of a river which fertilizes the vicinity, and runs through
the town, one of the pleasantest in Syria, once the capital of
the caliphs; and celebrated for its elegant buildings, the
politeness of its inhabitants, and the abundance of its
conveniences.</p>

<p id="id00916">The vizier declared he would stay in that pleasant place two
days, and pursue his journey on the third. In the mean time he
gave his retinue leave to go to Damascus; and almost all of them
made use of it: some influenced by curiosity to see a city they
had heard so much of, and others by the opportunity of vending
the Egyptian goods they had brought with them, or buying stuffs,
and the rarities of the country. The beautiful lady desiring her
son Agib might share in the satisfaction of viewing that
celebrated city, ordered the black eunuch, who acted in quality
of his governor, to conduct him thither.</p>

<p id="id00917">Agib, in magnificent apparel, went with the eunuch, who had a
large cane in his hand. They had no sooner entered the city, than
Agib, fair and glorious as the day, attracted the eyes of the
people. Some got out of their houses to gain a nearer and
narrower view of him; others put their heads out of the windows,
and those who passed along the street were not satisfied in
stopping to look upon him, but kept pace with him, to prolong the
pleasure of the agreeable sight: in fine, there was not a person
that did not admire him, and bestow a thousand benedictions on
the father and mother that had given being to so fine a child. By
chance the eunuch and he passed by the shop of Buddir ad Deen
Houssun, and there the crowd was so great, that they were forced
to halt.</p>

<p id="id00918">The pastry-cook who had adopted Buddir ad Deen Houssun had died
some years before, and left him his shop and all his property,
and he conducted the pastry trade so dexterously, that he had
gained great reputation in Damascus. Buddir ad Deen seeing so
great a crowd before his door, who were gazing so attentively
upon Agib and the black eunuch, stepped out to see them himself.</p>

<p id="id00919">Having cast his eyes upon Agib, Buddir ad Deen found himself
moved, he knew not how, nor for what reason. He was not struck
like the people with the brilliant beauty of the boy; another
cause unknown to him gave rise to the uneasiness and emotion he
felt. It was the force of blood that wrought in this tender
father; who, laying aside his business, made up to Agib, and with
an engaging air, said to him: "My little lord, who hast won my
soul, be so kind as to come into my shop, and eat a bit of such
fare as I have; that I may have the pleasure of admiring you at
my ease." These words he pronounced with such tenderness, that
tears trickled from his eyes. Little Agib was moved when he saw
his emotion; and turning to the eunuch, said, "This honest man
speaks in such an affectionate manner, that I cannot avoid
complying with his request; let us step into his house, and taste
his pastry." "It would be a fine thing truly," replied the slave,
"to see the son of a vizier go into a pastry-cook's shop to eat;
do not imagine that I will suffer any such thing." "Alas! my
lord," cried Buddir ad Deen, "it is cruelty to trust the conduct
of you in the hands of a person who treats you so harshly." Then
applying himself to the eunuch, "My good friend," continued he,
"pray do not hinder this young lord from granting me the favour I
ask; do not put such mortification upon me: rather do me the
honour to walk in along with him, and by so doing, you will let
the world know, that, though your outside is brown like a
chestnut, your inside is as white. Do you know," continued he,
"that I am master of the secret to make you white, instead of
being black as you are?" This set the eunuch a laughing, and then
he asked what that secret was. "I will tell you," replied Buddir
ad Deen, who repeated some verses in praise of black eunuchs,
implying, that it was by their ministry that the honour of
princes and of all great men was secured. The eunuch was so
charmed with these verses, that, without further hesitation, he
suffered Agib to go into the shop, and went in with him himself.</p>

<p id="id00920">Buddir ad Deen Houssun was overjoyed at having obtained what he
had so passionately desired, and, falling again to the work he
had discontinued "I was making," said he, "cream-tarts; and you
must, with submission, eat of them. I am persuaded you will find
them good; for my own mother, who made them incomparably well,
taught me, and the people send to buy them of me from all
quarters of the town." This said, he took a cream-tart out of the
oven, and after strewing upon it some pomegranate kernels and
sugar, set it before Agib, who found it very delicious.</p>

<p id="id00921">Another was served up to the eunuch, and he gave the same
judgment.</p>

<p id="id00922">While they were both eating, Buddir ad Deen viewed Agib very
attentively; and after looking upon him again and again, it came
into his mind that possibly he might have such a son by his
charming wife, from whom he had been so soon and so cruelly
separated; and the very thought drew tears from his eyes. He
intended to have put some questions to little Agib about his
journey to Damascus; but the child had no time to gratify his
curiosity, for the eunuch pressing him to return to his
grandfather's tent, took him away as soon as he had done eating.
Buddir ad Deen Houssun, not contented with looking after him,
shut up his shop immediately, and followed him.</p>

<p id="id00923">Buddir ad Deen Houssun ran after Agib and the eunuch, and
overtook them before they had reached the gate of the city. The
eunuch perceiving he followed them, was extremely surprised: "You
impertinent fellow," said he, with an angry tone, "what do you
want?" "My dear friend," replied Buddir ad Deen, "do not trouble
yourself; I have a little business out of town, and I must needs
go and look after it." This answer, however, did not at all
satisfy the eunuch, who turning to Agib, said, "This is all owing
to you; I foresaw I should repent of my complaisance; you would
needs go into the man's shop; it was not wisely done in me to
give you leave." "Perhaps," replied Agib, "he has real business
out of town, and the road is free to every body." While this
passed they kept walking together, without looking behind them,
till they came near the vizier's tents, upon which they turned
about to see if Buddir ad Deen followed them. Agib, perceiving he
was within two paces of him, reddened and whitened alternately,
according to the different emotions that affected him. He was
afraid the grand vizier his grandfather should come to know he
had been in the pastry shop, and had eaten there. In this dread,
he took up a large stone that lay at his foot and throwing it at
Buddir ad Deen, hit him in the forehead, and wounded him so that
his face was covered with blood. The eunuch gave Buddir ad Deen
to understand, he had no reason to complain of a mischance that
he had merited and brought upon himself.</p>

<p id="id00924">Buddir ad Deen turned towards the city staunching the blood of
the wound with his apron, which he had not put off. "I was a
fool," said he within himself, "for leaving my house, to take so
much pains about this brat; for doubtless he would never have
used me after this manner, if he had not thought I had some ill
design against him." When he got home, he had his wound dressed,
and softened the sense of his mischance by the reflection that
there was an infinite number of people upon the earth, who were
yet more unfortunate than he.</p>

<p id="id00925">Buddir ad Deen kept on the pastry-trade at Damascus, and his
uncle Shumse ad Deen Mahummud went from thence three days after
his arrival. He went by way of Emaus, Hanah, and Halep; then
crossed the Euphrates, and after passing through Mardin,
Moussoul, Singier, Diarbeker, and several other towns, arrived at
last at Bussorah. Immediately after his arrival he desired
audience of the sultan, who was no sooner informed of his quality
than he admitted him to his presence, received him very
favourably, and inquired the occasion of his journey to Bussorah.
"Sire," replied the vizier "I come to know what is become of the
son of my brother, who has had the honour to serve your majesty."
"Noor ad Deen Ali," said the sultan, "has been long dead; as for
his son, all I can tell you of him is, that he disappeared
suddenly, about two months after his father's death, and nobody
has seen him since, notwithstanding all the inquiry I ordered to
be made. But his mother, who is the daughter of one of my
viziers, is still alive." Shumse ad Deen Mahummud desired leave
of the sultan to take her to Egypt; and having obtained
permission, without waiting till the next day, inquired after her
place of abode, and that very hour went to her house, accompanied
with his daughter and his grandson.</p>

<p id="id00926">The widow of Noor ad Deen Ali resided still in the same place
where her husband had lived. It was a stately fabric, adorned
with marble pillars: but Shumse ad Deen did not stop to view it.
At his entry he kissed the gate, and the piece of marble upon
which his brother's name was written in letters of gold. He asked
to speak with his sister-in-law, and was told by her servants,
that she was in a small building covered by a dome, to which they
directed in the middle of a very spacious court. This tender
mother used to spend the greatest part of the day and night in
that room which she had built as a representation of the tomb of
her son Buddir ad Deen Houssun, whom she supposed to be dead
after so long an absence. She was pouring tears over his memorial
when Shumse ad Deen entering, found her buried in the deepest
affliction.</p>

<p id="id00927">He made his compliment, and after beseeching her to suspend her
tears and sighs, informed her he had the honour to be her
brother-in-law, and acquainted her with the reason of his journey
from Cairo to Bussorah.</p>

<p id="id00928">Shumse ad Deen Mahummud, after acquainting his sister-in-law with
all that had passed at Cairo on his daughter's wedding-night, and
informing her of the surprise occasioned by the discovery of the
paper sewed up in Buddir ad Deen's turban, presented to her Agib
and the beautiful lady.</p>

<p id="id00929">The widow of Noor ad Deen, who had still continued sitting like a
woman dejected, and weaned from the affairs of this world, no
sooner understood by his discourse that her dear son, whom she
lamented so bitterly, might still be alive, than she arose, and
repeatedly embraced the beautiful lady and her grandchild Agib;
and perceiving in the youth the features of Buddir ad Deen, drops
tears different from what she had been so long accustomed to
shed. She could not forbear kissing the youth, who, for his part,
received her embraces with all the demonstrations of joy he was
capable of shewing. "Sister," said Shumse ad Deen, "it is time to
dry your tears, and suppress your sighs; you must think of going
with us to Egypt. The sultan of Bussorah gives me leave to carry
you thither, and I doubt not you will consent. I am in hopes we
shall at last find out your son my nephew; and if we do, the
history of him, of you, of my own daughter, and of my own
adventures, will deserve to be committed to writing, and
transmitted to posterity."</p>

<p id="id00930">The widow of Noor ad Deen heard this proposal with pleasure, and
ordered preparations to be made for her departure. While they
were making, Shumse ad Deen desired a second audience, and after
taking leave of the sultan, who dismissed him with ample marks of
respect, and gave him a considerable present for himself, and
another of great value for the sultan of Egypt, he set out from
Bussorah once more for the city of Damascus.</p>

<p id="id00931">When he arrived in the neighbourhood of Damascus, he ordered his
tents to be pitched without the gate, at which he designed to
enter the city; and gave out he would tarry there three days, to
give his suit rest, and buy up curiosities to present to the
sultan of Egypt.</p>

<p id="id00932">While he was employed in selecting the finest stuffs which the
principal merchants had brought to his tents, Agib begged the
black eunuch his governor to carry him through the city, in order
to see what he had not had leisure to view before; and to inquire
what was become of the pastry cook whom he had wounded. The
eunuch complying with his request, went along with him towards
the city, after leave obtained of the beautiful lady his mother.</p>

<p id="id00933">They entered Damascus by the Paradise-gate, which lay next to the
tents of the vizier They walked through the great squares and the
public places where the richest goods were sold, and took a view of
the superb mosque at the hour of prayer, between noon and sun-set.
When they passed by the shop of Buddir ad Deen Houssun, whom they
still found employed in making cream tarts, "I salute you sir," said
Agib; "do you know me? Do you remember you ever saw me before?" Buddir
ad Deen hearing these words, fixed his eyes upon him, and recognizing
him (such was the surprising effect of paternal love!), felt the same
emotion as when he saw him first; he was confused, and instead of
making any answer, continued a long time without uttering a word. At
length, recovering himself, "My lord," said he, "be so kind as to come
once more with your governor into my house, and taste a cream-tart. I
beg your lordship's pardon, for the trouble I gave you in following
you out of town; I was at that time not myself, I did not know what I
did. You drew me after you, and the violence of the attraction was so
soft, that I could not withstand it."</p>

<p id="id00934">Agib, astonished at what Buddir ad Deen said, replied: "There is
an excess in the kindness you express, and unless you engage
under oath not to follow me when I go from hence, I will not
enter your house. If you give me your promise, and prove a man of
your word, I will visit you again to-morrow, since the vizier my
grandfather, is still employed in buying up rarities for a
present to the sultan of Egypt." "My lord," replied Buddir ad
Deen, "I will do whatever you would have me." This said, Agib and
the eunuch went into the shop.</p>

<p id="id00935">Presently after, Buddir ad Deen set before them a cream-tart,
that was full as good as what they had eaten before; "Come," said
Agib, "sit down by me, and eat with us." Buddir ad Deen sat down,
and attempted to embrace Agib, as a testimony of the joy he
conceived upon sitting by him. But Agib pushed him away, desiring
him not to be too familiar. Buddir ad Deen obeyed, and repeated
some extempore verses in praise of Agib: he did not eat, but made
it his business to serve his guests. When they had done, he
brought them water to wash, and a very white napkin to wipe their
hands. Then he filled a large china cup with sherbet, and put
snow into it; and offering it to Agib, "This," said he, "is
sherbet of roses; and I am sure you never tasted better." Agib
having drunk of it with pleasure, Buddir ad Deen took the cup
from him, and presented it to the eunuch, who drank it all off at
once.</p>

<p id="id00936">In fine, Agib and his governor having fared well, returned thanks
to the pastry-cook for their good entertainment, and moved
homewards, it being then late. When they arrived at the tents of
Shumse ad Deen Mahummud, Agib's grandmother received him with
transports of joy: her son ran always in her mind, and in
embracing Agib, the remembrance of him drew tears from her eyes.
"Ah, my child!" said she, "my joy would be perfect, if I had the
pleasure of embracing your father as I now embrace you." She made
Agib sit by her, and put several questions to him, relating to
the walk he had been taking with the eunuch; and when he
complained of being hungry, she gave him a piece of cream-tart,
which she had made for herself, and was indeed very good: she
likewise gave some to the eunuch.</p>

<p id="id00937">Agib no sooner touched the piece of cream-tart that had been set
before him, than he pretended he did not like it, and left it uncut;
and Shubbaunee (which was the eunuch's name) did the same. The widow
of Noor ad Deen Ali observed with regret that her grandson did not
like the tart. "What!" said she, "does my child thus despise the work
of my hands? Be it known to you, no one in the world can make such
besides myself and your father, whom I taught." "My good mother,"
replied Agib, "give me leave to tell you, if you do not know how to
make better, there is a pastry-cook in this town that outdoes you. We
were at his shop, and ate of one much better than yours."</p>

<p id="id00938">On hearing this, the grandmother, frowning upon the eunuch, said,
"How now, Shubbaunee, was the care of my grandchild committed to
you, to carry him to eat at pastry-shops like a beggar?" "Madam,"
replied the eunuch, "it is true, we did stop a little while and
talked with the pastry-cook, but we did not eat with him."
"Pardon me," said Agib, "we went into his shop, and there ate a
cream-tart." Upon this, the lady, more incensed against the
eunuch than before, rose in a passion from the table, and running
to the tent of Shumse ad Deen, informed him of the eunuch's
crime; and that in such terms, as tended more to inflame the
vizier than to dispose him to excuse it.</p>

<p id="id00939">The vizier who was naturally passionate, did not fail on this occasion
to display his anger. He went forthwith to his sister-in-law's tent,
and said to the eunuch, "Wretch, have you the impudence to abuse the
trust I repose in you?" Shubbaunee, though sufficiently convicted by
Agib's testimony, denied the fact still. But the child persisting in
what he had affirmed, "Grandfather," said he, "I can assure you we not
only ate, but that so very heartily, that we have no occasion for
supper: besides, the pastry-cook treated us also with a great bowl of
sherbet." "Well," cried Shumse ad Deen, "after all this, will you
continue to deny that you entered the pastry-cook's house, and ate
there?" Shubbaunee had still the impudence to swear it was not true.
"Then you are a liar," said the vizier "I believe my grandchild; but
after all, if you can eat up this cream-tart I shall be persuaded you
have truth on your side."</p>

<p id="id00940">Though Shubbaunee had crammed himself up to the throat before, he
agreed to stand that test, and accordingly took a piece of tart;
but his stomach rising against it, he was obliged to spit it out
of his mouth. Yet he still pursued the lie, and pretended he had
over-eaten himself the day before, and had not recovered his
appetite. The vizier irritated with all the eunuch's frivolous
presences, and convinced of his guilt, ordered him to be soundly
bastinadoed. In undergoing this punishment, the poor wretch
shrieked out aloud, and at last confessed the truth; "I own,"
cried he, "that we did eat a cream-tart at the pastry cook's, and
that it was much better than that upon the table."</p>

<p id="id00941">The widow of Noor ad Deen thought it was out of spite to her, and
with a desire to mortify her, that Shubbaunee commended the
pastry-cook's tart; and accordingly said, "I cannot believe the
cook's tarts are better than mine; I am resolved to satisfy
myself upon that head. Where does he live? Go immediately and buy
me one of his tarts." The eunuch repaired to Buddir ad Deen's
shop, and said, "Let me have one of your cream-tarts; one of our
ladies wants to taste them." Buddir ad Deen chose one of the
best, and gave it to the eunuch.</p>

<p id="id00942">Shubbaunee returned speedily to the tents, gave the tart to Noor
ad Deen's widow, who, snatching it greedily, broke a piece off;
but no sooner put it to her mouth, than she cried out and swooned
away. The vizier was extremely surprised at the accident; he
threw water upon her face, and was very active in recovering her.
As soon as she came to herself, "My God!" cried she, "it must
needs be my son, my dear Buddir ad Deen who made this tart."</p>

<p id="id00943">When the vizier Shumse ad Deen heard his sister-in-law say, that
the maker of the tart, brought by the eunuch, must needs be her
son, he was overjoyed; but reflecting that his joy might prove
groundless, and the conjecture of Noor ad Deen's widow be false,
"Madam," said he, "do you think there may not be a pastry-cook in
the world, who knows how to make cream-tarts as well as your
son?" "I own," replied she, "there may be pastry-cooks that can
make as good tarts as he; but as I make them in a peculiar
manner, and only my son was let into the secret, it must
absolutely be he that made this. Come, my brother," added she in
a transport, "let us call up mirth and joy; we have at last found
what we have been so long looking for." "Madam," said the vizier
answer, "I entreat you to moderate your impatience, for we shall
quickly know the truth. All we have to do, is to bring the
pastry-cook hither; and then you and my daughter will readily
distinguish whether he be your son or not. But you must both be
concealed so as to have a view of Buddir ad Deen while he cannot
see you; for I would not have our interview and mutual discovery
happen at Damascus. My design is to delay the discovery till we
return to Cairo."</p>

<p id="id00944">This said, he left the ladies in their tent, and retired to his
own; where he called for fifty of his men, and said to them:
"Take each of you a stick in your hands, and follow Shubbaunee,
who will conduct you to a pastry-cook in this city. When you
arrive there, break and dash in pieces all you find in the shop:
if he demand the reason of your outrage, only ask him in return
if it was not he that made the cream-tart that was brought from
his house. If he answer in the affirmative, seize his person,
fetter him, and bring him along with you; but take care you do
not beat him, nor do him the least harm. Go, and lose no time."</p>

<p id="id00945">The vizier's orders were immediately executed. The detachment,
conducted by the black eunuch, went with expedition to Buddir ad
Deen's house, broke in pieces the plates, kettles, copper pans,
and all the other moveables and utensils they met with, and
inundated the sherbet-shop with cream and comfits. Buddir ad
Deen, astonished at the sight, said with a pitiful tone, "Pray,
good people, why do you serve me so? What is the matter? What
have I done?" "Was it not you," said they, "that sold this eunuch
the cream-tart?" "Yes," replied he, "I am the man; and who says
any thing against it? I defy any one to make a better." Instead
of giving him an answer, they continued to break all round them,
and the oven itself was not spared.</p>

<p id="id00946">In the mean time the neighbours took the alarm, and surprised to
see fifty armed men committing such a disorder, asked the reason
of such violence; and Buddir ad Deen said once more to the
rioters, "Pray tell me what crime I have committed to deserve
this usage?" "Was it not you," replied they, "that made the
cream-tart you sold to the eunuch?" "Yes, yes, it was I," replied
he; "I maintain it is a good one. I do not deserve this
treatment." However, without listening to him, they seized his
person, and, snatching the cloth off his turban, tied his hands
with it behind his back, and, after dragging him by force out of
his shop, marched off.</p>

<p id="id00947">The mob gathering, from compassion to Buddir ad Deen, took his
part; but officers from the governor of the city dispersed the
people, and favoured the carrying off of Buddir ad Deen, for
Shumse ad Deen Mahummud had in the mean time gone to the
governor's house to acquaint him with the order he had given, and
to demand the interposition of force to favour the execution; and
the governor, who commanded all Syria in the name of the sultan
of Egypt, was unwilling to refuse any thing to his master's
vizier.</p>

<p id="id00948">It was in vain for Buddir ad Deen to ask those who carried him
off, what fault had been found with his cream-tart: they gave him
no answer. In short, they conducted him to the tents, and made
him wait there till Shumse ad Deen returned from the governor of
Damascus.</p>

<p id="id00949">Upon the vizier's return, the pretended culprit was brought
before him. "My lord," said Buddir ad Deen, with tears in his
eyes, "pray do me the favour to let me know wherein I have
displeased you." "Why, you wretch," exclaimed the vizier "was it
not you that made the cream-tart you sent me?" "I own I am the
man," replied Buddir ad Deen, "but pray what crime is that?" "I
will punish you according to your deserts," said Shumse ad Deen,
"it shall cost you your life, for sending me such a sorry tart."
"Ah!" exclaimed Buddir ad Deen, "is it a capital crime to make a
bad cream-tart?" "Yes," said the vizier "and you are to expect no
other usage from me."</p>

<p id="id00950">While this interview lasted, the ladies, who were concealed
behind curtains, saw Buddir ad Deen, and recognized him,
notwithstanding he had been so long absent. They were so
transported with joy, that they swooned away; and when they
recovered, would fain have run up and fallen upon his neck, but
the promise they had made to the vizier of not discovering
themselves, restrained the tender emotions of love and of nature.</p>

<p id="id00951">Shumse ad Deen having resolved to set out that night, ordered the
tents to be struck, and the necessary preparations to be made for
his journey. He ordered Buddir ad Deen to be secured in a sort of
cage, and laid on a camel. The vizier and his retinue began their
march, and travelled the rest of that night, and all the next
day, without stopping In the evening they halted, and Buddir ad
Deen was taken out of his cage, in order to be served with the
necessary refreshments, but still carefully kept at a distance
from his mother and his wife; and during the whole expedition,
which lasted twenty days, was served in the same manner.</p>

<p id="id00952">When they arrived at Cairo, they encamped in the neighbourhood of
the city; Shumse ad Deen called for Buddir ad Deen, and gave
orders, in his presence, to prepare a stake. "Alas!" said Buddir
ad Deen, "what do you mean to do with a stake?" "Why, to impale
you," replied Shumse ad Deen, "and then to have you carried
through all the quarters of the town, that the people may have
the spectacle of a worthless pastry-cook, who makes cream-tarts
without pepper." This said, Buddir ad Deen cried out so
ludicrously, that Shumse ad Deen could hardly keep his
countenance: "Alas!" said he, "must I suffer a death as cruel as
it is ignominious, for not putting pepper in a cream-tart?"</p>

<p id="id00953">"How," said Buddir ad Deen, "must I be rifled; must I be imprisoned in
a chest, and at last impaled, and all for not putting pepper in a
cream-tart? Are these the actions of Moosulmauns, of persons who make
a profession of probity, justice, and good works?" With these words he
shed tears, and then renewing his complaint; "No," continued he,
"never was a man used so unjustly, nor so severely. Is it possible
they should be capable of taking a man's life for not putting pepper
in a cream-tart? Cursed be all cream-tarts, as well as the hour in
which I was born! Would to God I had died that minute!"</p>

<p id="id00954">The disconsolate Buddir ad Deen did not cease his lamentations;
and when the stake was brought, cried out bitterly at the horrid
sight. "Heaven!" said he, "can you suffer me to die an
ignominious and painful death? And all this, for what crime? not
for robbery or murder, or renouncing my religion, but for not
putting pepper in a cream tart."</p>

<p id="id00955">Night being then pretty far advanced, the vizier ordered Buddir
ad Deen to be conveyed again to his cage, saying to him, "Stay
there till to-morrow; the day shall not elapse before I give
orders for your death." The chest or cage then was carried away
and laid upon the camel that had brought it from Damascus: at the
same time all the other camels were loaded again; and the vizier
mounting his horse, ordered the camel that carried his nephew to
march before him, and entered the city with all his suit. After
passing through several streets, where no one appeared, he
arrived at his palace, where he ordered the chest to be taken
down, but not opened till farther orders.</p>

<p id="id00956">While his retinue were unlading the other camels, he took Buddir
ad Deen's mother and his daughter aside; and addressed himself to
the latter: "God be praised," said he, "my child, for this happy
occasion of meeting your cousin and your husband! You remember,
of course, what order your chamber was in on your wedding night:
go and put all things as they were then placed; and if your
memory do not serve you, I can aid it by a written account, which
I caused to be taken upon that occasion."</p>

<p id="id00957">The beautiful lady went joyfully to execute her father's orders; and
he at the same time commanded the hall to be adorned as when Buddir ad
Deen Houssun was there with the sultan of Egypt's hunch-backed groom.
As he went over his manuscript, his domestics placed every moveable in
the described order. The throne was not forgotten, nor the lighted wax
candles. When every thing was arranged in the hall, the vizier went
into his daughter's chamber and put in their due place Buddir ad
Deen's apparel, with the purse of sequins. This done, he said to the
beautiful lady, "Undress yourself, my child, and go to bed. As soon as
Buddir ad Deen enters your room, complain of his being from you so
long, and tell him, that when you awoke, you were astonished you did
not find him by you. Press him to come to bed again; and to-morrow
morning you will divert your mother-in-law and me, by giving us an
account of your interview." This said, he went from his daughter's
apartment, and left her to undress herself and go to bed.</p>

<p id="id00958">Shumse ad Deen Mahummud ordered all his domestics to depart the
hall, excepting two or three, whom he desired to remain. These he
commanded to go and take Buddir ad Deen out of the cage, to strip
him to his under vest and drawers, to conduct him in that
condition to the hall, to leave him there alone, and shut the
door upon him.</p>

<p id="id00959">Buddir ad Deen, though overwhelmed with grief, was asleep so
soundly, that the vizier's domestics had taken him out of the
chest and stripped him before he awoke; and they carried him so
suddenly into the hall, that they did not give him time to see
where he was. When he found himself alone in the hall, he looked
round him, and the objects he beheld recalling to his memory the
circumstances of his marriage, he perceived, with astonishment,
that it was the place where he had seen the sultan's groom of the
stables. His surprise was still the greater, when approaching
softly the door of a chamber which he found open, he spied his
own raiments where he remembered to have left them on his wedding
night. "My God!" said he, rubbing his eyes, "am I asleep or
awake?"</p>

<p id="id00960">The beautiful lady, who in the mean time was diverting herself
with his astonishment, opened the curtains of her bed suddenly,
and bending her head forward, "My dear lord," said she, with a
soft, tender air, "what do you do at the door? You have been out
of bed a long time. I was strangely surprised when I awoke in not
finding you by me." Buddir ad Deen was enraptured; he entered the
room, but reverting to all that had passed during a ten years'
interval, and not being able to persuade himself that it could
all have happened in the compass of one night, he went to the
place where his vestments lay with the purse of sequins; and
after examining them very carefully, exclaimed, "By Allah these
are mysteries which I can by no means comprehend!" The lady, who
was pleased to see his confusion, said, once more, "My lord, what
do you wait for?" He stepped towards the bed, and said to her,
"Is it long since I left you?" "The question," answered she,
"surprises me. Did not you rise from me but now? Surely your mind
is deranged." "Madam," replied Buddir ad Deen, "I do assure you
my thoughts are not very composed. I remember indeed to have been
with you, but I remember at the same time, that I have since
lived ten years at Damascus. Now, if I was actually in bed with
you this night, I cannot have been from you so long. These two
points are inconsistent. Pray tell me what I am to think; whether
my marriage with you is an illusion, or whether my absence from
you is only a dream?" "Yes, my lord," cried she, "doubtless you
were light-headed when you thought you were at Damascus." Upon
this Buddir ad Deen laughed heartily, and said, "What a comical
fancy is this! I assure you, madam, this dream of mine will be
very pleasant to you. Do but imagine, if you please, that I was
at the gate of Damascus in my shirt and drawers, as I am here
now; that I entered the town with the halloo of a mob who
followed and insulted me; that I fled to a pastry cook who
adopted me, taught me his trade, and left me all he had when he
died; that after his death I kept a shop. In fine, I had an
infinity of other adventures, too tedious to recount: and all I
can say is, that it was well that I awoke, for they were going to
impale me!" "And for what," cried the lady, feigning
astonishment, "would they have used you so cruelly? Surely you
must have committed some enormous crime." "Not the least,"
replied Buddir ad Deen; "it was for nothing but a mere trifle,
the most ridiculous thing you can imagine. All the crime I was
charged with, was selling a cream-tart that had no pepper in it."
"As for that matter," said the beautiful lady laughing heartily,
"I must say they did you great injustice." "Ah!" replied he,
"that was not all. For this cursed cream-tart was every thing in
my shop broken to pieces, myself bound and fettered, and flung
into a chest, where I lay so close, that methinks I am there
still, but thanks be to God all was a dream."</p>

<p id="id00961">Buddir ad Deen was not easy all night. He awoke from time to time, and
put the question to himself, whether he dreamed or was awake. He
distrusted his felicity; and, to be sure whether it was true or not,
looked round the room. "I am not mistaken," said he; "this is the same
chamber where I entered instead of the hunch-backed groom of the
stables; and I am now in bed with the fair lady designed for him."
Day-light, which then appeared, had not yet dispelled his uneasiness,
when the vizier Shumse ad Deen, his uncle, knocked at the door, and at
the same time went in to bid him good morrow.</p>

<p id="id00962">Buddir ad Deen was extremely surprised to see a man he knew so
well, and who now appeared with a different air from that with
which he pronounced the terrible sentence of death against him.
"Ah!" cried Buddir ad Deen, "it was you who condemned me so
unjustly to a kind of death, the thoughts of which make me
shudder, and all for a cream-tart without pepper." The vizier
fell a laughing, and to put him out of suspense, told him how, by
the ministry of a genie (for hunch-back's relation made him
suspect the adventure), he had been at his palace, and had
married his daughter instead of the sultan's groom of the
stables; then he acquainted him that he had discovered him to be
his nephew by the memorandum of his father, and pursuant to that
discovery had gone from Cairo to Bussorah in quest of him. "My
dear nephew," added he, embracing him with every expression of
tenderness, "I ask your pardon for all I have made you undergo
since I discovered you. I resolved to bring you to my palace
before I told you your happiness; which ought now to be so much
the dearer to you, as it has cost you so much perplexity and
distress. To atone for all your afflictions, comfort yourself
with the joy of being in the company of those who ought to be
dearest to you. While you are dressing yourself I will go and
acquaint your mother, who is beyond measure impatient to see you;
and will likewise bring to you your son, whom you saw at
Damascus, and for whom, without knowing him, you shewed so much
affection."</p>

<p id="id00963">No words can adequately express the joy of Buddir ad Deen, when
he saw his mother and his son. They embraced, and shewed all the
transports that love and tenderness could inspire. The mother
spoke to Buddir ad Deen in the most moving terms; she mentioned
the grief she had felt for his long absence, and the tears she
had shed. Little Ajib, instead of flying his father's embraces,
as at Damascus, received them with all the marks of pleasure. And
Buddir ad Deen Houssun, divided between two objects so worthy of
his love, thought he could not give sufficient testimonies of his
affection.</p>

<p id="id00964">While this passed, the vizier was gone to the palace, to give the
sultan an account of the happy success of his travels; and the
sultan was so moved with the recital of the story, that he
ordered it to be taken down in writing, and carefully preserved
among the archives of the kingdom. After Shumse ad Deen's return
to his palace, he sat down with his family, and all the household
passed the day in festivity and mirth.</p>

<p id="id00965">The vizier Jaaffier having thus concluded the story of Buddir ad
Deen, told the caliph that this was what he had to relate to his
majesty. The caliph found the story so surprising, that without
farther hesitation he granted his slave Rihan's pardon; and to
console the young man for the grief of having unhappily deprived
himself of a woman whom he had loved so tenderly, married him to
one of his slaves, bestowed liberal gifts upon him, and
maintained him till he died.</p>

<h2 id="id00966" style="margin-top: 4em">            THE HISTORY OF GANEM, SON OF ABOU AYOUB,
           AND KNOWN BY THE SURNAME OF LOVE'S SLAVE.</h2>

<p id="id00967" style="margin-top: 3em">There was formerly at Damascus a merchant, who had by care and
industry acquired great wealth, on which he lived in a very
honourable manner. His name was Abou Ayoub, and he had one son
and a daughter. The son was called Ganem, but afterwards surnamed
Love's slave. His person was graceful, and the excellent
qualities of his mind had been improved by able masters. The
daughter's name was Alcolom, signifying Ravisher of hearts,
because her beauty was so perfect that whoever saw her could not
avoid loving her.</p>

<p id="id00968">Abou Ayoub died, and left immense riches: a hundred loads of
brocades and other silks that lay in his warehouse were the least
part. The loads were ready made up, and on every bale was written
in large characters, "For Bagdad."</p>

<p id="id00969">Mahummud, the son of Soliman, surnamed Zinebi, reigned at that
time at Damascus, the capital of Syria. His kinsman, Haroon al
Rusheed, had bestowed that kingdom on him as his tributary.</p>

<p id="id00970">Soon after the death of Abou Ayoub, Ganem conversed with his
mother about their domestic affairs, and concerning the loads of
merchandize in the warehouse, asked her the meaning of what was
written upon each bale. "My son," answered his mother, "your
father used to travel sometimes into one province, and sometimes
into another; and it was customary with him, before he set out,
to write the name of the city he designed to repair to on every
bade. He had provided all things to take a journey to Bagdad, and
was on the point of setting out, when death"&#8212;&#8212;She had not power
to finish; the lively remembrance of the loss of her husband
would not permit her to say more, and drew from her a shower of
tears.</p>

<p id="id00971">Ganem could not see his mother so sensibly affected, without
being equally so himself. They continued some time silent; but at
length he recovered himself, and as soon as he found his mother
calm enough to listen to him, said, "Since my father designed
these goods for Bagdad, I will prepare myself to perform that
journey; and I think it will be proper for me to hasten my
departure, for fear those commodities should perish, or that we
should lose the opportunity of selling them to the best
advantage."</p>

<p id="id00972">Abou Ayoub's widow, who tenderly loved her son, was much
concerned at this resolution, and replied, "My dear child, I
cannot but commend you for designing to follow your father's
example; but consider, that you are too young, inexperienced, and
unaccustomed to the fatigue of travelling. Besides, can you think
of leaving me, and adding to that sorrow with which I am already
oppressed? Is it not better to sell those goods to the merchants
of Damascus, and take up with a moderate profit, than expose
yourself to the danger of perishing?"</p>

<p id="id00973">It was in vain for her to oppose Ganem's resolution by the
strongest arguments; they had no weight with him. An inclination
to travel, and to accomplish himself by a thorough knowledge of
the world, urged him to set out, and prevailed over all his
mother's remonstrances, her entreaties, and even her tears. He
went to the market where slaves were sold, and bought such as
were able-bodied, hired a hundred camels, and having provided all
other necessaries, entered upon his journey, with five or six
merchants of Damascus, who were going to trade at Bagdad.</p>

<p id="id00974">Those merchants, attended by their slaves, and accompanied by
several other travellers, made up such a considerable caravan,
that they had nothing to fear from the Bedouin Arabs, who make it
their only profession to range the country; and attack and
plunder the caravans when they are not strong enough to repulse
them. They had no other difficulty to encounter, than the usual
fatigues of a long journey, which were easily forgotten when they
came in sight of the city of Bagdad, where they arrived in
safety.</p>

<p id="id00975">They alighted at the most magnificent and most frequented khan in
the city; but Ganem chose to be lodged conveniently, and by
himself. He only left his goods there in a warehouse for their
greater security, and hired a spacious house in the
neighbourhood, richly furnished, having a garden which was very
delightful, on account of its many waterworks and shady groves.</p>

<p id="id00976">Some days after this young merchant had been settled in his
house, and perfectly recovered of the fatigue of his journey, he
dressed himself richly, and repaired to the public place, where
the merchants met to transact business. A slave followed him,
carrying a parcel of fine stuffs and silks.</p>

<p id="id00977">The merchants received Ganem very courteously, and their syndic,
or chief, to whom he first made application, bought all his
parcel, at the price set down in the ticket annexed to every
piece of stuff. Ganem continued his trade so successfully, that
he every day sold all the goods he exposed.</p>

<p id="id00978">He had but one bale left, which he had caused to be carried from
the warehouse to his own house; he then went to the public
rendezvous, where he found all the shops shut. This seemed
somewhat extraordinary to him and having asked the cause, he was
told, that one of the first merchants, whom he knew, was dead,
and that all his brother traders were gone to his funeral.</p>

<p id="id00979">Ganem inquired for the mosque, where prayer was to be said, and
whence the body was to be conducted to the grave; and having been
informed, sent back his slave with the goods, and walked towards
the mosque. He got thither before the prayers were ended, which
were said in a hall hung with black satin. The corpse was taken
up, and followed by the kindred, the merchants, and Ganem, to the
place of burial, which was at some distance without the city. It
was a stone structure, in form of a dome, purposely built to
receive the bodies of all the family of the deceased, and being
very small, they had pitched tents around, that all the company
might be sheltered during the ceremony. The monument was opened,
and the corpse laid in it, after which it was shut up. Then the
imam, and other ministers of the mosque, sat down in a ring on
carpets, in the largest tent, and recited the rest of the
prayers. They also read the Fateah, or introductory chapter of
the Koraun, appointed for the burial of the dead. The kindred and
merchants sat round, in the same manner, behind the ministers.</p>

<p id="id00980">It was near night before all was ended: Ganem who had not
expected such a long ceremony, began to be uneasy, and the more
so, when he saw meat served up, in memory of the deceased,
according to the custom of the Mahummedans. He was also told that
the tents had been set up not only against the heat of the sun,
but also against the evening dew, because they should not return
to the city before the next morning. These words perplexed Ganem.
"I am a stranger," said he to himself, "and have the reputation
of being a rich merchant; thieves may take the opportunity of my
absence, and rob my house. My slaves may be tempted by so
favourable an opportunity; they may run away with all the gold I
have received for my goods, and whither shall I go to look for
them?" Full of these thoughts, he ate a few mouthfuls hastily,
and slipped away from the company.</p>

<p id="id00981">He made all possible haste; but, as it often happens that the
more a man hurries the less he advances, he went astray in the
dark, so that it was near midnight when he came to the city gate;
which, to add to his misfortune, was shut. This was a fresh
affliction to him, and he was obliged to look for some convenient
place in which to pass the rest of the night till the gate was
opened. He went into a burial-place, so spacious, that it reached
from the city to the very place he had left. He advanced to some
high walls, which enclosed a small field, being the mausoleum of
a family, and in which there was a palm-tree. Ganem, finding that
the burial-place where the palm-tree grew was open, went into it,
and shut the door after him. He lay down on the grass and tried
to sleep; but his uneasiness at being absent from home would not
permit him. He got up, and after having passed before the door
several times, opened it, without knowing why, and immediately
perceived at a distance a light, which seemed to come towards
him. He was startled at the sight, closed the door, which had
nothing to secure it but a latch, and got up as fast as he could
to the top of the palm-tree; looking upon that as the safest
retreat under his present apprehensions.</p>

<p id="id00982">No sooner was he up, than by the help of the light which had
alarmed him, he plainly perceived three men, whom, by their
habit, he knew to be slaves, enter into the burial-place. One of
them advanced with a lantern, and the two others followed him,
loaded with a chest, between five and six feet long, which they
carried on their shoulders. They set it down, and then one of the
three slaves said to his comrades, "Brethren, if you will be
advised by me, we will leave the chest here, and return to the
city." "No, no," replied another, "that would not be executing
our mistress's orders; we may have cause to repent not doing as
we were commanded. Let us bury the chest, since we are enjoined
so to do." The two other slaves complied. They began to break
ground with the tools they had brought for that purpose. When
they had made a deep trench, they put the chest into it, and
covered it with the earth they had taken out, and then departed.</p>

<p id="id00983">Ganem, who from the top of the palm-tree had heard every word the
slaves had spoken, could not tell what to think of the adventure. He
concluded that the chest must contain something of value, and that the
person to whom it belonged had some particular reasons for causing it
to be buried in the cemetery. He resolved immediately to satisfy his
curiosity, came down from the palm-tree, the departure of the slaves
having dissipated his fear, and fell to work upon the pit, plying his
hands and feet so well, that in a short time he uncovered the chest,
but found it secured by a padlock. This new obstacle to the satisfying
of his curiosity was no small mortification to him, yet he was not
discouraged, but the day beginning then to appear, he saw several
great stones about the burial-place. He picked out one, with which he
easily knocked off the padlock, and then with much impatience opened
the chest. Ganem was strangely surprised, when, instead of money, he
discovered a young lady of incomparable beauty. Her fresh and rosy
complexion, and her gentle regular breathing, satisfied him she was
alive, but he could not conceive why, if she were only asleep, she had
not awaked at the noise he made in forcing off the padlock. Her habit
was so costly, with bracelets and pendants of diamonds, and a necklace
of pearls, so large, that he made not the least doubt of her being one
of the principal ladies of the court. At the sight of so beautiful an
object, not only compassion and natural inclination to relieve persons
in danger, but something more powerful, which Ganem could not then
account for, prevailed on him to afford the unfortunate beauty all the
assistance in his power.</p>

<p id="id00984">He first shut the gate of the burial-place, which the slaves had
left open; then, returning, took the lady in his arms, and laid
her on the soft earth which he had thrown off the chest. As soon
as she was exposed to the air, she sneezed, and, by the motion in
turning her head, there came from her mouth a liquor, with which
her stomach seemed to have been loaded; then opening and rubbing
her eyes, she with such a voice as charmed Ganem, whom she did
not see, cried out, "Zohorob Bostan, Shijher al Mirjaun, Casabos
Souccar, Nouron Nihar, Nagmatos Sohi, Nonzbetos Zaman, why do you
not answer? where are you?" These were the names of six female
slaves that used to wait on her. She called them, and wondered
that nobody answered; but at length looking about, and perceiving
she was in a burial-place, was seized with fear. "What," cried
she, much louder than before, "are the dead raised? Is the day of
judgment come? What a wonderful change is this from evening to
morning?"</p>

<p id="id00985">Ganem did not think fit to leave the lady any longer in her
perplexity, but presented himself before her with all possible
respect, and in the most courteous manner. "Madam," said he, "I
am not able to express my joy at having happened to be here to do
you the service I have, and to offer you all the assistance you
may need under your present circumstances."</p>

<p id="id00986">In order to persuade the lady to repose confidence in him, he, in
the first place, told her who he was, and what accident had
brought him to that place. Next he acquainted her with the coming
of the three slaves, and how they had buried the chest. The lady,
who had covered her face with her veil as soon as Ganem appeared,
was extremely sensible of the obligations she owed him. "I return
thanks to God," said she "for having sent so worthy a person as
you are to deliver me from death; but since you have begun so
charitable a work, I conjure you not to leave it imperfect. Let
me beg of you to go into the city, and provide a muleteer, to
come with his mule, and carry me to your house in this chest;
for, should I go with you on foot, my dress being different from
that of the city ladies, some one might take notice of it, and
follow me, which it highly concerns me to prevent. When I shall
be in your house, I will give you an account of myself; and in
the mean time be assured that you have not obliged an ungrateful
person."</p>

<p id="id00987">Before the young merchant left the lady, he drew the chest out of
the pit, which he filled up with earth, laid her again in the
chest, and shut it in such a manner, that it did not look as if
the padlock had been forced off; but for fear of stifling her, he
did not put it quite close, leaving room for the admittance of
air. Going out of the burial-place, he drew the door after him;
and the city gate being then open, soon found what he sought. He
returned with speed to the burial place, and helped the muleteer
to lay the chest across his mule, telling him, to remove all
cause of suspicion, that he came to that place the night before,
with another muleteer, who, being in haste to return home, had
laid down the chest where he saw it.</p>

<p id="id00988">Ganem, who, since his arrival at Bagdad, had minded nothing but
his business, was still unacquainted with the power of love, and
now felt its first attacks. It had not been in his power to look
upon the young lady without being dazzled; and the uneasiness he
felt at following the muleteer at a distance, and the fear lest
any accident might happen by the way that should deprive him of
his conquest, taught him to unravel his thoughts. He was more
than usually delighted, when, being arrived safe at home, he saw
the chest unloaded. He dismissed the muleteer, and having caused
a slave to shut the door of his house, opened the chest, helped
the lady out, gave her his hand, and conducted her to his
apartment, lamenting how much she must have endured in such close
confinement. "If I have suffered," said she, "I have satisfaction
sufficient in what you have done for me, and in the pleasure of
seeing myself out of danger."</p>

<p id="id00989">Though Ganem's apartment was very richly furnished, the lady did
not so much regard its appearance, as she did the handsome
presence and engaging mien of her deliverer, whose politeness and
obliging behaviour heightened her gratitude. She sat down on a
sofa, and to give the merchant to understand how sensible she was
of the service done her, took off her veil. Ganem on his part was
sensible of the favour so lovely a lady did in uncovering her
face to him, or rather felt he had already a most violent passion
for her. Whatever obligations she owed him, he thought himself
more than requited by so singular a favour.</p>

<p id="id00990">The lady dived into Ganem's thoughts, yet was not at all alarmed,
because he appeared very respectful. He, judging she might have
occasion to eat, and not willing to trust any but himself with
the care of entertaining so charming a guest, went out with a
slave to an eating-house, to give directions for an
entertainment. From thence he went to a fruiterer, where he chose
the finest and best fruit; buying also the choicest wine, and the
same bread that was eaten at the caliph's table.</p>

<p id="id00991">As soon as he returned home, he with his own hands made a pyramid
of the fruit he had bought, and serving it up himself to the lady
in a large dish, of the finest china-ware, "Madam," said he, "be
pleased to make choice of some of this fruit, while a more solid
entertainment, and more worthy yourself, is preparing." He would
have continued standing before her, but she declared she would
not touch any thing, unless he sat down and ate with her. He
obeyed; and when they had eaten a little, Ganem observing that
the lady's veil, which she laid down by her on a sofa, was
embroidered along the edge with golden letters, begged her
permission to look on the embroidery. The lady immediately took
up the veil, and delivered it to him, asking him whether he could
read? "Madam," replied he, with a modest air, "a merchant would
be ill-qualified to manage his business if he could not at least
read and write." "Well, then," said she, "read the words which
are embroidered on that veil, which gives me an opportunity of
telling you my story."</p>

<p id="id00992">Ganem took the veil, and read these words, "I am yours, and you
are mine, thou descendant from the prophet's uncle." That
descendant from the prophet's uncle was the caliph Haroon al
Rusheed, who then reigned, and was descended from Abbas,
Mahummud's uncle.</p>

<p id="id00993">When Ganem perceived these words, "Alas! madam," said he, in a
melancholy tone, "I have just saved your life, and this writing
is my death! I do not comprehend all the mystery; but it
convinces me I am the most unfortunate of men. Pardon, madam, the
liberty I take, but it was impossible for me to see you without
giving you my heart. You are not ignorant yourself, that it was
not in my power to refuse it you, and that makes my presumption
excusable. I proposed to myself to touch your heart by my
respectful behaviour, my care, my assiduity, my submission, my
constancy; and no sooner have I formed the flattering design,
than I am robbed of all my hopes. I cannot long survive so great
a misfortune. But, be that as it will, I shall have the
satisfaction of dying entirely yours. Proceed, madam, I conjure
you, and give me full information of my unhappy fate."</p>

<p id="id00994">He could not utter those words without letting fall some tears.
The lady was moved; but was so far from being displeased at the
declaration he made, that she felt secret joy; for her heart
began to yield. However, she concealed her feelings, and as if
she had not regarded what Ganem had said. "I should have been
very cautious," answered she, "of shewing you my veil, had I
thought it would have given you so much uneasiness; but I do not
perceive that what I have to say to you can make your condition
so deplorable as you imagine."</p>

<p id="id00995">"You must understand," proceeded she, "in order to acquaint you
with my story, that my name is Fetnah (which signifies
disturbance), which was given me at my birth, because it was
judged that the sight of me would one day occasion many
calamities. Of this you cannot be ignorant, since there is nobody
in Bagdad but knows that the caliph, my sovereign lord and yours,
has a favourite so called.</p>

<p id="id00996">"I was carried into his palace in my tenderest years, and I have
been brought up with all the care that is usually taken with such
persons of my sex as are destined to reside there. I made no
little progress in all they took the pains to teach me; and that,
with some share of beauty, gained me the affection of the caliph,
who allotted me a particular apartment adjoining to his own. That
prince was not satisfied with such a mark of distinction; he
appointed twenty women to wait on me, and as many eunuchs; and
ever since he has made me such considerable presents, that I saw
myself richer than any queen in the world. You may judge by what
I have said, that Zobeide, the caliph's wife and kinswoman, could
not but be jealous of my happiness. Though Haroon has all the
regard imaginable for her, she has taken every possible
opportunity to ruin me.</p>

<p id="id00997">"Hitherto I had secured myself against all her snares, but at
length I fell under the last effort of her jealousy; and, had it
not been for you, must now have been exposed to inevitable death.
I question not but she had corrupted one of my slaves, who last
night, in some lemonade, gave me a drug, which causes such a dead
sleep, that it is easy to dispose of those who have taken it; for
that sleep is so profound, that nothing can dispel it for the
space of seven or eight hours. I have the more reason to judge
so, because naturally I am a very bad sleeper, and apt to wake at
the least noise.</p>

<p id="id00998">"Zobeide, the better to put her design in execution, has availed
herself of the absence of the caliph, who went lately to put
himself at the head of his troops, to chastise some neighbouring
kings, who have formed a league of rebellion. Were it not for
this opportunity, my rival, outrageous as she is, durst not have
presumed to attempt any thing against my life. I know not what
she will do to conceal this action from the caliph, but you see
it highly concerns me that you should keep my secret. My life
depends on it. I shall be safe in your house as long as the
caliph is from Bagdad. It concerns you to keep my adventure
private; for should Zobeide know the obligation I owe you, she
would punish you for having saved me.</p>

<p id="id00999">"When the caliph returns, I shall not need to be so much upon my
guard. I shall find means to acquaint him with all that has
happened, and I am fully persuaded he will be more earnest than
myself to requite a service which restores me to his love."</p>

<p id="id01000">As soon as Haroon al Rusheed's beautiful favourite had done
speaking, Ganem said, "Madam, I return you a thousand thanks for
having given me the information I took the liberty to desire of
you; and I beg of you to believe, that you are here in safety;
the sentiments you have inspired are a pledge of my secrecy.</p>

<p id="id01001">"As for my slaves, they may perhaps fail of the fidelity they owe
me, should they know by what accident and in what place I had the
happiness to find you. I dare assure you, however, that they will
not have the curiosity to inquire. It is so natural for young men
to purchase beautiful slaves, that it will be no way surprising
to them to see you here, believing you to be one, and that I have
bought you. They will also conclude that I have some particular
reasons for bringing you home as they saw I did. Set your heart,
therefore, at rest, as to that point, and remain satisfied that
you shall be served with all the respect that is due to the
favourite of so great a monarch as our sovereign the caliph. But
great as he is, give me leave, madam, to declare, that nothing
can make me recall the present I have made you of my heart. I
know, and shall never forget, 'that what belongs to the master is
forbidden to the slave;' but I loved you before you told me that
you were engaged to the caliph; it is not in my power to overcome
a passion which, though now in its infancy, has all the force of
a love strengthened by a perfect of situation. I wish your august
and most fortunate lover may avenge you of the malice of Zobeide,
by calling you back to him; and when you shall be restored to his
wishes, that you may remember the unfortunate Ganem, who is no
less your conquest than the caliph. Powerful as that prince is, I
flatter myself he will not be able to blot me out of your
remembrance. He cannot love you more passionately than I do; and
I shall never cease to love you into whatever part of the world I
may go to expire, after having lost you."</p>

<p id="id01002">Fetnah perceived that Ganem was under the greatest of
afflictions, and his situation affected her; but considering the
uneasiness she was likely to bring upon herself, by prosecuting
the conversation on that subject, which might insensibly lead her
to discover the inclination she felt for him; "I perceive," said
she, "that this conversation gives you too much uneasiness; let
us change the subject, and talk of the infinite obligation I owe
you. I can never sufficiently express my gratitude, when I
reflect that, without your assistance, I should never again have
beheld the light of the sun."</p>

<p id="id01003">It was happy for them both, that somebody just then knocked at
the door; Ganem went to see who it was, and found it to be one of
his slaves come to acquaint him that the entertainment was ready.
Ganem, who, by way of precaution, would have none of his slaves
come into the room where Fetnah was, took what was brought, and
served it up himself to his beautiful guest, whose soul was
ravished to behold what attention he paid her.</p>

<p id="id01004">When they had eaten, Ganem took away, as he had covered the
table; and having delivered all things at the door of the
apartment to his slaves, "Madam," said he to Fetnah, "you may now
perhaps desire to take some rest; I will leave you, and when you
have reposed yourself, you shall find me ready to receive your
commands."</p>

<p id="id01005">Having thus spoken, he left her, and went to purchase two
women-slaves. He also bought two parcels, one of fine linen, and the
other of all such things as were proper to make up a toilet fit for
the caliph's favourite. Having conducted home the two women-slaves, he
presented them to Fetnah, saying, "Madam, a person of your quality
cannot be without two waiting-maids, at least, to serve you; be
pleased to accept of these."</p>

<p id="id01006">Fetnah, admiring Ganem's attention, said, "My lord, I perceive
you are not one that will do things by halves: you add by your
courtesy to the obligations I owe you already; but I hope I shall
not die ungrateful, and that heaven will soon place me in a
condition to requite all your acts of generosity."</p>

<p id="id01007">When the women-slaves were withdrawn into a chamber adjoining, he
sat down on the sofa, but at some distance from Fetnah, in token
of respect. He then began to discourse of his passion. "I dare
not so much as hope," said he, "to excite the least sensibility
in a heart like yours, destined for the greatest prince in the
world. Alas! it would be a comfort to me in my misfortune, if I
could but flatter myself, that you have not looked upon the
excess of my love with indifference." "My lord," answered Fetnah
"Alas! madam," said Ganem, interrupting her at the word lord,
"this is the second time you have done me the honour to call me
lord; the presence of the women-slaves hindered me the first time
from taking notice of it to you: in the name of God, madam, do
not give me this title of honour; it does not belong to me; treat
me, I beseech you, as your slave: I am, and shall never cease to
be so."</p>

<p id="id01008">"No, no," replied Fetnah, interrupting him in her turn, "I shall
be cautious how I treat with such disrespect a man to whom I owe
my life. I should be ungrateful, could I say or do any thing that
did not become you. Leave me, therefore, to follow the dictates
of my gratitude, and do not require of me, that I should
misbehave myself towards you, in return for the benefits I have
received. I shall never be guilty of such conduct; I am too
sensible of your respectful behaviour to abuse it; and I will not
hesitate to own, that I do not regard your care with
indifference. You know the reasons that condemn me to silence."</p>

<p id="id01009">Ganem was enraptured at this declaration; he wept for joy, and
not being able to find expressions significant enough, in his own
opinion, to return Fetnah thanks, was satisfied with telling her,
that as she knew what she owed to the caliph, he, on his part,
was not ignorant "that what belongs to the master is forbidden to
the slave."</p>

<p id="id01010">Night drawing on, he rose up to fetch a light, which he brought
in himself, as also a collation.</p>

<p id="id01011">They both sat down at table, and at first complimented each other
on the fruit as they presented it reciprocally. The excellence of
the wine insensibly drew them both to drink; and having drunk two
or three glasses, they agreed that neither should take another
glass without first singing some air. Ganem sung verses ex
tempore, expressive of the vehemence of his passion; and Fetnah,
encouraged by his example, composed and sung verses relating to
her adventure, and always containing something which Ganem might
take in a sense favourable to himself; except in this, she most
exactly observed the fidelity due to the caliph. The collation
continued till very late, and the night was far advanced before
they thought of parting. Ganem then withdrew to another
apartment, leaving Fetnah where she was, the women slaves he had
bought coming in to wait upon her.</p>

<p id="id01012">They lived together in this manner for several days. The young
merchant went not abroad, unless upon of the utmost consequence,
and even for that took the time when the lady was reposing; for
he could not prevail upon himself to lose a moment that might be
spent in her company. All his thoughts were taken up with his
dear Fetnah, who, on her side, gave way to her inclination,
confessed she had no less affection for him than he had for her.
However, fond as they were of each other, their respect for the
caliph kept them within due bounds, which still heightened their
passion.</p>

<p id="id01013">Whilst Fetnah, thus snatched from the jaws of death, passed her
time so agreeably with Ganem, Zobeide was not without some
apprehensions in the palace of Haroon al Rusheed.</p>

<p id="id01014">No sooner had the three slaves, entrusted with the execution of
her revenge, carried away the chest, without knowing what it
contained, or so much as the least curiosity to inquire (being
used to pay a blind obedience to her commands), than she was
seized with a tormenting uneasiness; a thousand perplexing
thoughts disturbed her rest; sleep fled from her eyes, and she
spent the night in contriving how to conceal her crime. "My
consort," said she, "loves Fetnah more than ever he did any of
his favourites. What shall I say to him at his return, when he
inquires of me after her?" Many contrivances occurred to her, but
none were satisfactory. Still she met with difficulties, and knew
not where to fix. There lived with her a lady advanced in years,
who had bred her up from her infancy. As soon as it was day, she
sent for her, and having entrusted her with the secret, said, "My
good mother, you have always assisted me with your advice; if
ever I stood in need of it, it is now, when the business before
you is to still my thoughts, distracted by a mortal anxiety, and
to show me some way to satisfy the caliph."</p>

<p id="id01015">"My dear mistress," replied the old lady, "it had been much
better not to have run yourself into the difficulties you labour
under; but since the thing is done, the best consolation is to
think no more of it. All that must now be thought of, is how to
deceive the commander of the believers; and I am of opinion, that
you should immediately cause a wooden image resembling a dead
body to be carved. We will shroud it up in linen, and when shut
up in a coffin, it shall be buried in some part of the palace;
you shall then immediately cause a marble mausoleum to be built,
in the form of a dome, over the burial place, and erect a tomb,
which shall be covered with embroidered cloth, and set about with
great candlesticks and large wax tapers. There is another thing,"
added the old lady, "which ought not to be forgotten; you must
put on mourning, and cause the same to be done by your own and
Fetnah's women, your eunuchs, and all the officers of the palace.
When the caliph returns, and sees you all and the palace in
mourning, he will not fail to ask the occasion of it. You will
then have an opportunity of insinuating yourself into his favour,
by saying, it was out of respect to him that you paid the last
honours to Fetnah, snatched away by sudden death. You may tell
him, you have caused a mausoleum to be built, and, in short, that
you have paid all the last honours to his favourite, as he would
have done himself had he been present. His passion for her being
extraordinary, he will certainly go to shed tears upon her grave;
and perhaps," added the old woman, "he will not believe she is
really dead. He may, possibly, suspect you have turned her out of
the palace through jealousy, and look upon all the mourning as an
artifice to deceive him, and prevent his making inquiries after
her. It is likely he will cause the coffin to be taken up and
opened, and it is certain he will be convinced of her death, as
soon as he shall see the figure of a dead body buried. He will be
pleased with all you shall have done, and express his gratitude.
As for the wooden image, I will myself undertake to have it cut
by a carver in the city, who shall not know the purpose for which
it is designed. As for your part, madam, order Fetnah's woman,
who yesterday gave her the lemonade, to give out, among her
companions, that she has just found her mistress dead in her bed;
and in order that they may only think of lamenting, without
offering to go into her chamber, let her add, she has already
acquainted you with the circumstance, and that you have ordered
Mesrour to cause her to be buried."</p>

<p id="id01016">As soon as the old lady had spoken, Zobeide took a rich diamond
ring out of her casket, and putting it on her finger, and
embracing her in a transport of joy, said, "How infinitely am I
beholden to you, my good mother! I should never have thought of
so ingenious a contrivance. It cannot fail of success, and I
begin to recover my peace. I leave the care of the wooden figure
to you, and will go myself to order the rest."</p>

<p id="id01017">The wooden image was got ready with as much expedition as Zobeide
could have wished, and then conveyed by the old lady herself into
Fetnah's bed-chamber, where she dressed it like a dead body, and
put it into a coffin. Then Mesrour, who was himself deceived by
it, caused the coffin and the representation of Fetnah to be
carried away, and buried with the usual ceremonies in the place
appointed by Zobeide, the favourite's women weeping and
lamenting, she who had given her the lemonade setting them an
example by her cries and lamentations.</p>

<p id="id01018">That very day Zobeide sent for the architect of the palace, and,
according to orders, the mausoleum was finished in a short time.
Such potent princesses as the consort of a monarch, whose power
extended from east to west, are always punctually obeyed in
whatsoever they command. She soon put on mourning with all the
court; so that the news of Fetnah's death was quickly spread over
the city.</p>

<p id="id01019">Ganem was one of the last who heard of it; for, as I have before
observed, he hardly ever went abroad. Being, however, at length
informed of it, "Madam," said he to the caliph's fair favourite,
"you are supposed in Bagdad to be dead, and I do not question but
that Zobeide herself believes it. I bless heaven that I am the
cause, and the happy witness of your being alive; would to God,
that, taking advantage of this false report, you would share my
fortune, and go far from hence to reign in my heart! But whither
does this pleasing transport carry me? I do not consider that you
are born to make the greatest prince in the world happy; and that
only Haroon al Rusheed is worthy of you. Supposing you could
resolve to give him up for me, and that you would follow me,
ought I to consent? No, it is my part always to remember, 'that
what belongs to the master is forbidden to the slave.'"</p>

<p id="id01020">The lovely Fetnah, though moved by the tenderness of the passion
he expressed, yet prevailed with herself not to encourage it. "My
lord," said she to him, "we cannot obstruct the momentary triumph
of Zobeide. I am not surprised at the artifice she uses to
conceal her guilt: but let her go on; I flatter myself that
sorrow will soon follow her triumph. The caliph will return, and
we shall find the means privately to inform him of all that has
happened. In the mean time let us be more cautious than ever,
that she may not know I am alive. I have already told you the
consequences to be apprehended from such a discovery."</p>

<p id="id01021">At the end of three months the caliph returned to Bagdad with
glory, having vanquished all his enemies. He entered the palace
with impatience to embrace Fetnah; but was amazed to see all the
officers in mourning; and his concern was redoubled when,
approaching the apartment of Zobeide, he beheld that princess
coming to meet him in mourning with all her women. He immediately
asked her the cause, with much agitation. "Commander of the
believers," answered Zobeide, "I am in mourning for your slave
Fetnah; who died so suddenly that it was impossible to apply any
remedy to her disorder." She would have proceeded, but the caliph
did not give her time, being so agitated at the news, that he
uttered a feeble exclamation, and fainted. On recovering himself,
he, with a feeble voice, which sufficiently expressed his extreme
grief, asked where his dear Fetnah had been buried. "Sir," said
Zobeide, "I myself took care of her funeral, and spared no cost
to make it magnificent. I have caused a marble mausoleum to be
built over her grave, and will attend you thither if you desire."</p>

<p id="id01022">The caliph would not permit Zobeide to take that trouble, but
contented himself to have Mesrour to conduct him. He went thither just
as he was, in his camp dress. When he saw the tomb, the wax-lights
round it, and the magnificence of the mausoleum, he was amazed that
Zobeide should have performed the obsequies of her rival with so much
pomp; and being naturally of a jealous temper, suspected his wife's
generosity and fancied his mistress might perhaps be yet alive; that
Zobeide, taking advantage of his long absence, might have turned her
out of the palace, ordering those she had entrusted to conduct her, to
convey her so far off that she might never more be heard of. This was
all he suspected; for he did not think Zobeide wicked enough to have
attempted the life of his favourite.</p>

<p id="id01023">The better to discover the truth himself, he ordered the tomb to
be removed, and caused the grave and the coffin to be opened in
his presence; but when he saw the linen wrapped round the wooden
image, he durst not proceed any farther. This devout caliph
thought it would be a sacrilegious act to suffer the body of the
dead lady to be touched; and this scrupulous fear prevailed over
his love and curiosity. He doubted not of Fetnah's death. He
caused the coffin to be shut up again, the grave to be filled,
and the tomb to be made as it was before.</p>

<p id="id01024">The caliph thinking himself obliged to pay some respect to the
grave of his favourite, sent for the ministers of religion, the
officers of the palace, and the readers of the Koraun; and,
whilst they were collecting together, he remained in the
mausoleum, moistening with his tears the marble that covered the
phantom of his mistress. When all the persons he had sent for
were come, he stood before the tomb, and recited long prayers;
after which the readers of the Koraun read several, chapters.</p>

<p id="id01025">The same ceremony was performed every day for a whole month,
morning and evening, the caliph being always present, with the
grand vizier, and the principal officers of the court, all of
them in mourning, as well as the caliph himself, who all the time
ceased not to honour the memory of Fetnah with his tears, and
would not hear of any business.</p>

<p id="id01026">The last day of the month, the prayers and reading of the Koraun
lasted from morning till break of day the next morning. The
caliph, being tired with sitting up so long, went to take some
rest in his apartment, and fell asleep upon a sofa, between two
of the court ladies, one of them sitting at the bed's-head, and
the other at the feet, who, whilst he slept, were working some
embroidery, and observed a profound silence.</p>

<p id="id01027">She who sat at the bed's-head, and whose name was Nouron-Nihar,
perceiving the caliph was asleep, whispered to the other, called
Nagmatos Sohi, "There is great news! The commander of the
believers our master will be overjoyed when he awakes, and hears
what I have to tell him; Fetnah is not dead, she is in perfect
health." "O heavens!" cried Nagmatos Sohi, in a transport of joy,
"is it possible, that the beautiful, the charming, the
incomparable Fetnah should be still among the living?" She
uttered these words with so much vivacity, and so loud, that the
caliph awoke. He asked why they had disturbed his rest? "Alas! my
sovereign lord," answered the slave, "pardon me this
indiscretion; I could not without transport hear that Fetnah is
still alive; it caused such emotion in me, as I could not
suppress." "What then is become of her," demanded the caliph, "if
she is not dead?" "Chief of the believers," replied the other, "I
this evening received a note from a person unknown, written with
Fetnah's own hand; she gives me an account of her melancholy
adventure, and orders me to acquaint you with it. I thought fit,
before I fulfilled my commission, to let you take some few
moments' rest, believing you must stand in need of it, after your
fatigue; and&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id01028">"Give me that note," said the caliph, interrupting her eagerly,
"you were wrong to defer delivering it to me."</p>

<p id="id01029">The slave immediately presented to him the note, which he opened
with much impatience, and in it Fetnah gave a particular account
of all that had befallen her, but enlarged a little too much on
the attentions of Ganem. The caliph, who was naturally jealous,
instead of being provoked at the inhumanity of Zobeide, was more
concerned at the infidelity he fancied Fetnah had been guilty of
towards him. "Is it so?" said he, after reading the note; "the
perfidious wretch has been four months with a young merchant, and
has the effrontery to boast of his attention to her. Thirty days
are past since my return to Bagdad, and she now thinks of sending
me news of herself. Ungrateful creature! whilst I spend the days
in bewailing her, she passes them in betraying me. Go to, let us
take vengeance of a bold woman, and that bold youth who affronts
me." Having spoken these words, the caliph rose, and went into a
hall where he used to appear in public, and give audience to his
court. The first gate was opened, and immediately all the
courtiers, who were waiting without, entered. The grand vizier,
came in, and prostrated himself before the throne. Then rising,
he stood before his master, who, in a tone which denoted he would
be instantly obeyed, said to him, "Jaaffier, your presence is
requisite, for putting in execution an important affair I am
about to commit to you. Take four hundred men of my guards with
you, and first inquire where a merchant of Damascus lives whose
name is Ganem, the son of Abou Ayoub. When you have learnt this,
repair to his house, and cause it to be razed to the foundations;
but first secure Ganem, and bring him hither, with my slave
Fetnah, who has lived with him these four months. I will punish
her, and make an example of that insolent man, who has presumed
to fail in respell to me."</p>

<p id="id01030">The grand vizier, having received this positive command, made a
low prostration to the caliph, having his hand on his head, in
token that he would rather lose it than disobey him, and
departed. The first thing he did, was to send to the syndic of
the dealers in foreign stuffs and silks, with strict orders to
find out the house of the unfortunate merchant. The officer he
sent with these orders brought him back word, that he had
scarcely been seen for some months, and no man knew what could
keep him at home, if he was there. The same officer likewise told
Jaaffier where Ganem lived.</p>

<p id="id01031">Upon this information, that minister, without losing time, went to the
judge of the police, whom he caused to bear him company, and attended
by a great number of carpenters and masons, with the necessary tools
for razing a house, came to Ganem's residence; and finding it stood
detached from any other, he posted his soldiers round it, to prevent
the young merchant's making his escape.</p>

<p id="id01032">Fetnah and Ganem had just dined: the lady was sitting at a window
next the street; hearing a noise, she looked out through the
lattice, and seeing the grand vizier, approach with his
attendants, concluded she was their object as well as Ganem. She
perceived her note had been received, but had not expected such a
consequence, having hoped that the caliph would have taken the
matter in a different light. She knew not how long the prince had
been returned from his campaign, and though she was acquainted
with his jealous temper, yet apprehended nothing on that account.
However, the sight of the grand vizier, and the soldiers made her
tremble, not indeed for herself, but for Ganem: she did not
question clearing herself, provided the caliph would but hear
her. As for Ganem, whom she loved less out of gratitude than
inclination, she plainly foresaw that his incensed rival might be
apt to condemn him, on account of his youth and person. Full of
this thought, she turned to the young merchant and said, "Alas!
Ganem, we are undone." Ganem looked through the lattice, and was
seized with dread, when he beheld the caliph's guards with their
naked cimeters, and the grand vizier, with the civil magistrate
at the head of them. At this sight he stood motionless, and had
not power to utter one word. "Ganem," said the favourite, "there
is no time to be lost; if you love me, put on the habit of one of
your slaves immediately, and disfigure your face and arms with
soot. Then put some of these dishes on your head; you may be
taken for a servant belonging to the eating house, and they will
let you pass. If they happen to ask you where the master of the
house is, answer, without any hesitation, that he is within."
"Alas! madam," answered Harem, concerned for himself than for
Fetnah, "you only take care of me, what will become of you?" "Let
not that trouble you," replied Fetnah, "it is my part to look to
that. As for what you leave in this house, I will take care of
it, and I hope it will be one day faithfully restored to you,
when the caliph's anger shall be over; but at present avoid his
fury. The orders he gives in the heat of passion are always
fatal." The young merchant's affliction was so great, that he
knew not what course to pursue, and would certainly have suffered
himself to be seized by the caliph's soldiers, had not Fetnah
pressed him to disguise himself. He submitted to her persuasions,
put on the habit of a slave, daubed himself with soot, and as
they were knocking at the door, all they could do was to embrace
each other tenderly. They were both so overwhelmed with sorrow,
that they could not utter a word. Thus they parted. Ganem went
out with some dishes on his head: he was taken for the servant of
an eating-house, and no one offered to stop him. On the contrary,
the grand vizier, who was the first that met him, gave way and
let him pass, little thinking that he was the man he looked for.
Those who were behind the grand vizier, made way as he had done,
and thus favoured his escape He soon reached one of the gates,
and got clear of the city.</p>

<p id="id01033">Whilst he was making the best of his way from the grand vizier,
that minister came into the room where Fetnah was sitting on a
sofa, and where there were many chests full of Ganem's clothes,
and of the money he had made of his goods.</p>

<p id="id01034">As soon as Fetnah saw the grand vizier, come into the room, she
fell upon her face, and continuing in that posture, as it were to
receive her death; "My lord," said she, "I am ready to undergo
the sentence passed against me by the commander of the believers;
you need only make it known to me." "Madam," answered Jaaffier,
falling also down till she had raised herself, "God forbid any
man should presume to lay profane hands on you. I do not intend
to offer you the least harm. I have no farther orders, than to
intreat you will be pleased to go with me to the palace, and to
conduct you thither, with the merchant that lives in this house."
"My lord," replied the favourite, "let us go; I am ready to
follow you. As for the young merchant, to whom I am indebted for
my life, he is not here, he has been gone about a month since to
Damascus, whither his business called him, and has left these
chests you see under my care, till he returns. I conjure you to
cause them to be carried to the palace, and order them to be
secured, that I may perform the promise I made him to take all
possible care of them."</p>

<p id="id01035">"You shall be obeyed," said Jaaffier, and immediately sent for
porters, whom he commanded to take up the chests, and carry them
to Mesrour.</p>

<p id="id01036">As soon as the porters were gone, he whispered the civil
magistrate, committing to him the care of seeing the house razed,
but first to cause diligent search to be made for Ganem, who, he
suspected, might be hidden, notwithstanding what Fetnah had told
him. He then went out, taking her with him, attended by the two
slaves who waited on her. As for Ganem's slaves, they were not
regarded; they ran in among the crowd, and it was not known what
became of them.</p>

<p id="id01037">No sooner was Jaaffier out of the house, than the masons and
carpenters began to demolish it, and did their business so
effectually, that in a few hours none of it remained. But the
civil magistrate, not finding Ganem, after the strictest search,
sent to acquaint the grand vizier, before that minister reached
the palace. "Well," said Haroon al Rusheed, seeing him come into
his closet, "have you executed my orders?" "Yes," answered
Jaaffier "the house Ganem lived in is levelled with the ground,
and I have brought you your favourite Fetnah; she is at your
closet door, and I will call her in, if you command me. As for
the young merchant, we could not find him, though every place has
been searched, and Fetnah affirms that he has been gone a month
to Damascus."</p>

<p id="id01038">Never was passion equal to that of the caliph, when he heard that
Ganem had made his escape. As for his favourite, believing that
she had been false to him, he would neither see nor speak to her.
"Mesrour," said he to the chief of the eunuchs, who was then
present, "take the ungrateful and perfidious Fetnah, and shut her
up in the dark tower." That tower was within the precinct of the
palace, and commonly served as a prison for the favourites who
any way offended the caliph.</p>

<p id="id01039">Mesrour being used to execute his sovereign's orders, however
unjust, without making any answer, obeyed this with some
reluctance. He signified his concern to Fetnah, who was the more
grieved because she had assured herself, that the caliph would
not refuse to speak to her. She was obliged to submit to her hard
fate, and to follow Mesrour, who conducted her to the dark tower,
and there left her.</p>

<p id="id01040">In the mean time, the enraged caliph dismissed his grand vizier,
and only hearkening to his passion, wrote the following letter
with his own hand to the king of Syria, his cousin and tributary,
who resided at Damascus.</p>

<p id="id01041">"This letter is to inform you, that a merchant of Damascus, whose
name is Ganem, the son of Abou Ayoub, has seduced the most
amiable of my women slaves, called Fetnah, and is fled. It is my
will, that when you have read my letter, you cause search to be
made for Ganem, and secure him. When he is in your power, you
shall cause him to be loaded with irons, and for three days
successively let him receive fifty strokes of the bastinado. Then
let him be led through all parts of the city by a crier,
proclaiming, 'This is the smallest punishment the commander of
the believers inflicts on him that offends his lord, and
debauches one of his slaves.' After that you shall send him to me
under a strong guard. It is my will that you cause his house to
be plundered; and after it has been razed, order the materials to
be carried out of the city into the middle of the plain. Besides
this, if he has father, mother, sister, wives, daughters, or
other kindred, cause them to be stripped; and when they are
naked, expose them three days to the whole city, forbidding any
person on pain of death to afford them shelter. I expect you will
without delay execute my command."</p>

<p id="id01042">The caliph having written this letter, dispatched it by an
express, ordering him to make all possible speed, and to take
pigeons along with him, that he might the sooner hear what had
been done by Mahummud Zinebi.</p>

<p id="id01043">The pigeons of Bagdad have this peculiar quality, that from
wherever they may be carried to, they return to Bagdad as soon as
they are set at liberty, especially when they have young ones. A
letter rolled up is made fast under their wing, and by that means
advice is speedily received from such places as it is desired.</p>

<p id="id01044">The caliph's courier travelled night and day, as his master's
impatience required; and being come to Damascus, went directly to
king Zinebi's palace, who sat upon his throne to receive the
caliph's letter. The courier having delivered it, Mahummud
looking at it, and knowing the hand, stood up to shew his
respect, kissed the letter, and laid it on his head, to denote he
was ready submissively to obey the orders it contained. He opened
it, and having read it, immediately descended from his throne,
and without losing time, mounted on horseback with the principal
officers of his household. He sent for the civil magistrate; and
went directly to Ganem's house, attended by all his guards.</p>

<p id="id01045">Ganem's mother had never received any letter from him since he
had left Damascus; but the other merchants with whom he went to
Bagdad were returned, and all of them told her they had left her
son in perfect however, seeing he did not return, she could not
but be persuaded that he was dead, and was so fully convinced of
this in her imagination, that she went into mourning. She
bewailed Ganem as if she had seen him die, and had herself closed
his eyes: never mother expressed greater sorrow; and so far was
she from seeking any comfort, that she delighted in indulging her
grief. She had caused a dome to be built in the middle of the
court belonging to her house, in which she placed a tomb. She
spent the greatest part of the days and nights in weeping under
that dome, as if her son had been buried there: her daughter bore
her company, and mixed her tears with hers.</p>

<p id="id01046">It was now some time since they had thus devoted themselves to
sorrow, and the neighbourhood, hearing their cries and
lamentations, pitied such tender relations, when king Mahummud
Zinebi knocked at the door, which being opened by a slave
belonging to the family, he hastily entered the house, inquiring
for Ganem, the son of Abou Ayoub.</p>

<p id="id01047">Though the slave had never seen king Zinebi, she guessed by his
retinue that he must be one of the principal officers of
Damascus. "My lord," said she, "that Ganem you inquire for is
dead; my mistress, his mother, is in that monument, lamenting
him." The king, not regarding what was said by the slave, caused
all the house to be diligently searched by his guards for Ganem.
He then advanced towards the monument, where he saw the mother
and daughter sitting on a mat, and their faces appeared to him
bathed in tears. These poor women immediately veiled themselves,
as soon as they beheld a man at the door of the dome; but the
mother, knowing the king of Damascus, got up, and ran to cast
herself at his feet. "My good lady," said he, "I was looking for
your son, Ganem, is he here?" "Alas! sir," cried the mother, "it
is a long time since he has ceased to be: would to God I had at
least put him into his coffin with my own hands, and had had the
comfort of having his bones in this monument! O my son, my dear
son!" She would have said more, but was oppressed with such
violent sorrow that she was unable to proceed.</p>

<p id="id01048">Zinebi was moved; for he was a prince of a mild nature, and had
much compassion for the sufferings of the unfortunate. "If Ganem
alone be guilty," thought he to himself, "why should the mother
and the daughter, who are innocent, be punished? Ah! cruel Haroon
al Rusheed! what a mortification do you put upon me, in making me
the executioner of your vengeance, obliging me to persecute
persons who have not offended you."</p>

<p id="id01049">The guards whom the king had ordered to search for Ganem, came
and told him their search had been vain. He was fully convinced
of this; the tears of those two women would not leave him any
room to doubt. It distracted him to be obliged to execute the
caliph's order. "My good lady," said he to Ganem's mother, "quit
this monument with your daughter, it is no place of safety for
you." They went out, and he, to secure them against any insult,
took off his own robe, and covered them both with it, bidding
them keep close to him. He then ordered the populace to be let in
to plunder, which was performed with the utmost rapaciousness,
and with shouts which terrified Ganem's mother and sister the
more, because they knew not the reason. The rabble carried off
the richest goods, chests full of wealth, fine Persian and Indian
carpets, cushions covered with cloth of gold and silver, fine
China ware; in short, all was taken away, till nothing remained
but the bare walls of the house: and it was a dismal spectacle
for the unhappy ladies, to see all their goods plundered, without
knowing why they were so cruelly treated.</p>

<p id="id01050">When the house was plundered, Mahummud ordered the civil
magistrate to raze the house and monument; and while that was
doing, he carried away the mother and daughter to his palace.
There it was he redoubled their affliction, by acquainting them
with the caliph's will. "He commands me," said he to them, "to
cause you to be stripped, and exposed naked for three days to the
view of the people. It is with the utmost reluctance that I
execute such a cruel and ignominious sentence." The king
delivered these words with such an air, as plainly made it appear
his heart was really pierced with grief and compassion. Though
the fear of being dethroned prevented his following the dictates
of his pity, yet he in some measure moderated the rigour of the
caliph's orders, by causing large shifts, without sleeves, to be
made of coarse horse-hair for Ganem's mother, and his sister.</p>

<p id="id01051">The next day, these two victims of the caliph's rage were
stripped of their clothes, and their horse-hair shifts put upon
them; their head-dress was also taken away, so that their
dishevelled hair hung floating on their backs. The daughter had
the finest hair, and it hung down to the ground. In this
condition they were exposed to the people. The civil magistrate,
attended by his officers, were along with them, and they were
conducted through the city. A crier went before them, who every
now and then cried, "This is the punishment due to those who have
drawn on themselves the indignation of the commander of the
believers."</p>

<p id="id01052">Whilst they walked in this manner along the streets of Damascus,
with their arms and feet naked, clad in such a strange garment,
and endeavouring to hide their confusion under their hair, with
which they covered their faces, all the people were dissolved in
tears; more especially the ladies, considering them as innocent
persons, as they beheld them through their lattice windows, and
being particularly moved by the daughter's youth and beauty, they
made the air ring with their shrieks, as they passed before their
houses. The very children, frightened at those shrieks, and at
the spectacle that occasioned them, mixed their cries with the
general lamentation. In short, had an enemy been in Damascus,
putting all to fire and sword, the consternation could not have
been greater.</p>

<p id="id01053">It was near night when this dismal scene concluded. The mother
and daughter were both conducted back to king Mahummud's palace.
Not being used to walk bare-foot, they were so spent, that they
lay a long time in a swoon. The queen of Damascus, highly
afflicted at their misfortunes, notwithstanding the caliph's
prohibition to relieve them, sent some of her women to comfort
them, with all sorts of refreshments and wine, to recover their
spirits.</p>

<p id="id01054">The queen's women found them still in a swoon, and almost past
receiving any benefit by what they offered them. However, with
much difficulty they were brought to themselves. Ganem's mother
immediately returned them thanks for their courtesy. "My good
madam," said one of the queen's ladies to her, "we are highly
concerned at your affliction, and the queen of Syria, our
mistress, has done us a favour in employing us to assist you. We
can assure you, that princess is much afflicted at your
misfortunes, as well as the king her consort." Ganem's mother
entreated the queen's women to return her majesty a thousand
thanks from her and her daughter, and then directing her
discourse to the lady who spoke to her, "Madam," said she, "the
king has not told me why the chief of the believers inflicts so
many outrages on us: pray be pleased to tell us what crimes we
have been guilty of." "My good lady," answered the other, "the
origin of your misfortunes proceeds from your son Ganem. He is
not dead, as you imagine. He is accused of having seduced the
beautiful Fetnah, the best beloved of the caliph's favourites;
but having, by flight, withdrawn himself from that prince's
indignation, the punishment is fallen on you. All condemn the
caliph's resentment, but all fear him; and you see king Zinebi
himself dares not resist his orders, for fear of incurring his
displeasure. All we can do is to pity you, and exhort you to have
patience."</p>

<p id="id01055">"I know my son," answered Ganem's mother; "I have educated him
carefully, and in that respect which is due to the commander of
the believers. He cannot have committed the crime he is accused
of; I dare answer for his innocence. But I will cease to murmur
and complain, since it is for him that I suffer, and he is not
dead. O Ganem!" added she, in a transport of affection and joy,
"my dear son Ganem! is possible that you are still alive? I am no
longer concerned for the loss of my fortune; and how harsh and
unjust soever the caliph's orders may be, I forgive him, provided
heaven has preserved my son. I am only concerned for my daughter;
her sufferings alone afflict me; yet I believe her to be so good
a sister as to follow my example."</p>

<p id="id01056">On hearing these words, the young lady, who till then had
appeared insensible, turned to her mother, and clasping her arms
about her neck, "Yes, dear mother," said she, "I will always
follow your example, whatever extremity your love for my brother
may reduce us to."</p>

<p id="id01057">The mother and daughter thus interchanging their sighs and tears,
continued a considerable time in such moving embraces. In the
mean time the queen's women, who were much affected at the
spectacle, omitted no persuasions to prevail with Ganem's mother
to take some sustenance. She ate a morsel out of complaisance,
and her daughter did the like.</p>

<p id="id01058">The caliph having ordered that Ganem's kindred should be exposed
three days successively to the sight of the people, in the
condition already mentioned, the unhappy ladies afforded the same
spectacle the second time next day, from morning till night. But
that day and the following, the streets, which at first had been
full of people, were now quite empty. All the merchants, incensed
at the ill usage of Abou Ayoub's widow and daughter, shut up
their shops, and kept themselves close within their houses. The
ladies, instead of looking through their lattice windows,
withdrew into the back parts of their houses. There was not a
person to be seen in the public places through which those
unfortunate women were carried. It seemed as if all the
inhabitants of Damascus had abandoned their city.</p>

<p id="id01059">On the fourth day, the king resolving punctually to obey the
caliph's orders, though he did not approve of them, sent criers
into all quarters of the city to make proclamation, strictly
commanding all the inhabitants of Damascus, and strangers, of
what condition soever, upon pain of death, and having their
bodies cast to the dogs to be devoured, not to receive Ganem's
mother and sister into their houses, or give them a morsel of
bread or a drop of water, and, in a word, not to afford them the
least support, or hold the least correspondence with them.</p>

<p id="id01060">When the criers had performed what the king had enjoined them,
that prince ordered the mother and the daughter to be turned out
of the palace, and left to their choice to go where they thought
fit. As soon as they appeared, all persons fled from them, so
great an impression had the late prohibition made upon all. They
easily perceived that every body shunned them; but not knowing
the reason, were much surprised; and their amazement was the
greater, when coming into any street, or among any persons, they
recollected some of their best friends, who immediately retreated
with as much haste as the rest. "What is the meaning of this,"
said Ganem's mother; "do we carry the plague about us? Must the
unjust and barbarous usage we have received render us odious to
our fellow-citizens? Come, my child," added she, "let us depart
from Damascus with all speed; let us not stay any longer in a
city where we are become frightful to our very friends."</p>

<p id="id01061">The two wretched ladies, discoursing in this manner, came to one
of the extremities of the city, and retired to a ruined house to
pass the night. Thither some Mussulmauns, out of charity and
compassion, resorted to them after the day was shut in. They
carried them provisions, but durst not stay to comfort them, for
fear of being discovered, and punished for disobeying the
caliph's orders.</p>

<p id="id01062">In the mean time king Zinebi had let fly a pigeon to give the
caliph an account of his exact obedience. He informed him of all
that had been executed, and conjured him to direct what he would
have done with Ganem's mother and sister. He soon received the
caliph's answer in the same way, which was, that he should banish
them from Damascus for ever. Immediately the king of Syria sent
men to the old house, with orders to take the mother and
daughter, and to conduct them three days' journey from Damascus,
and there to leave them, forbidding them ever to return to the
city.</p>

<p id="id01063">Zinebi's men executed their commission, but being less exact
their master, in the strict performance of the caliph's orders,
they in pity gave the wretched ladies some small pieces of money,
and each of them a scrip, which they hung about their necks, to
carry their provisions.</p>

<p id="id01064">In this miserable state they came to the first village. The
peasants' wives flocked about them, and, as it appeared through
their disguise that they were people of some condition, asked
them what was the occasion of their travelling in a habit that
did not seem to belong to them. Instead of answering the
question, they fell to weeping, which only served to heighten the
curiosity of the peasants, and to move their compassion. Ganem's
mother told them what she and her daughter had endured; at which
the good countrywomen were sensibly afflicted, and endeavoured to
comfort them. They treated them as well as their poverty would
permit, took off their horse-hair shifts, which were very uneasy
to them, and put on them others which they gave them, with shoes,
and something to cover their heads, and save their hair.</p>

<p id="id01065">Having expressed their gratitude to those charitable women, Jalib
al Koolloob and her mother departed from that village, taking
short journeys towards Aleppo. They used at dusk to retire near
or into the mosques, where they passed the night on the mat, if
there was any, or else on the bare pavement; and sometimes rested
in the public places appointed for the use of travellers. As for
sustenance, they did not want, for they often came to places
where bread, boiled rice, and other provisions are distributed to
all travellers who desire it.</p>

<p id="id01066">At length they came to Aleppo, but would not stay there, and
continuing their journey towards the Euphrates, crossed the
river, and entered Mesopotamia, which they traversed as far as
Moussoul. Thence, notwithstanding all they had endured, they
proceeded to Bagdad. That was the place they had fixed their
thoughts upon, hoping to find Ganem, though they ought not to
have fancied that he was in a city where the caliph resided; but
they hoped, because they wished it; their affection for him
increasing instead of diminishing, with their misfortunes. Their
conversation was generally about him, and they inquired for him
of all they met. But let us leave Jalib al Koolloob and her
mother, and return to Fetnah.</p>

<p id="id01067">She was still confined closely in the dark tower, since the day
that had been so fatal to Ganem and herself. However,
disagreeable as her prison was to her, it was much less grievous
than the thoughts of Ganem's misfortune, the uncertainty of whose
fate was a killing affliction. There was scarcely a moment in
which she did not lament him.</p>

<p id="id01068">The caliph was accustomed to walk frequently at night within the
enclosure of his palace, for he was the most inquisitive prince
in the world, and sometimes, by those night-walks, came to the
knowledge of things that happened in his court, which would
otherwise never have reached his ear. One of those nights, in his
walk, he happened to pass by the dark tower, and fancying he
heard somebody talk, stops, and drawing near the door to listen,
distinctly heard these words, which Fetnah, whose thoughts were
always on Ganem, uttered with a loud voice: "O Ganem, too
unfortunate Ganem! where are you at this time, whither has thy
cruel fate led thee? Alas! it is I that have made you wretched!
why did you not let me perish miserably, rather than afford me
your generous relief? What melancholy return have you received
for your care and respect? The commander of the faithful, who
ought to have rewarded, persecutes you; and in requital for
having always regarded me as a person reserved for his bed, you
lose your fortune, and are obliged to seek for safety in flight.
O caliph, barbarous caliph, how can you exculpate yourself, when
you shall appear with Ganem before the tribunal of the Supreme
Judge, and the angels shall testify the truth before your face?
All the power you are now invested with, and which makes almost
the whole world tremble, will not prevent your being condemned
and punished for your violent and unjust proceedings." Here
Fetnah ceased her complaints, her sighs and tears putting a stop
to her utterance.</p>

<p id="id01069">This was enough to make the caliph reflect. He plainly perceived,
that if what he had heard was true, his favourite must be
innocent, and that he had been too hasty in giving such orders
against Ganem and his family. Being resolved to be rightly
informed in an affair which so nearly concerned him in point of
equity, on which he valued himself, he immediately returned to
his apartment, and that moment ordered Mesrour to repair to the
dark tower, and bring Fetnah before him.</p>

<p id="id01070">By this command, and much more by the caliph's manner of
speaking, the chief of the eunuchs guessed that his master
designed to pardon his favourite, and take her to him again. He
was overjoyed at the thought, for he respected Fetnah, and had
been much concerned at her disgrace; therefore flying instantly
to the tower, "Madam," said he to the favourite, with such an air
as expressed his satisfaction, "be pleased to follow me; I hope
you will never more return to this melancholy abode: the
commander of the faithful wishes to speak with you, and I draw
from this a happy omen."</p>

<p id="id01071">Fetnah followed Mesrour, who conducted her into the caliph's
closet. She prostrated herself before him, and so continued, her
face bathed in tears. "Fetnah," said the caliph, without bidding
her rise, "I think you charge me with violence and injustice. Who
is he, that, notwithstanding the regard and respell he had for
me, is in a miserable condition? Speak freely, you know the
natural goodness of my disposition, and that I love to do
justice."</p>

<p id="id01072">By these words the favourite was convinced that the caliph had
heard what she had said, and availed herself of so favourable an
opportunity to clear Ganem. "Commander of the true believers,"
said she, "if I have let fall any word that is not agreeable to
your majesty, I most humbly beseech you to forgive me; but he
whose innocence and wretched state you desire to be informed of
is Ganem, the unhappy son of Abou Ayoub, late a rich merchant of
Damascus. He saved my life from a grave, and afforded me a
sanctuary in his house. I must own, that, from the first moment
he saw me, he perhaps designed to devote himself to me, and
conceived hopes of engaging me to admit his love. I guessed at
this, by the eagerness which he shewed in entertaining me, and
doing me all the good offices I so much wanted under the
circumstances I was then in; but as soon as he heard that I had
the honour to belong to you, 'Ah, madam,' said he, 'that which
belongs to the master is forbidden to the slave.' From that
moment, I owe this justice to his virtue to declare, his
behaviour was always suitable to his words. You, commander of the
true believers, well know with what rigour you have treated him,
and you will answer for it before the tribunal of God."</p>

<p id="id01073">The caliph was not displeased with Fetnah for the freedom of
these words; "But may I," said he, "rely on the assurance you
give me of Ganem's virtue?" "Yes," replied Fetnah, "you may. I
would not for the world conceal the truth from you; and to prove
to you that I am sincere, I must make a confession, which perhaps
may displease you, but I beg pardon of your majesty beforehand."
"Speak, daughter," said Haroon al Rusheed, "I forgive you all,
provided you conceal nothing from me." "Well, then," replied
Fetnah, "let me inform you, that Ganem's respectful behaviour,
joined to all the good offices he did me, gained him my esteem. I
went further yet: you know the tyranny of love: I felt some
tender inclination rising in my breast. He perceived it; but far
from availing himself of my frailty, and notwithstanding the
flame which consumed him, he still remained steady in his duty,
and all that his passion could force from him were the words I
have already repeated to your majesty, 'That which belongs to the
master is forbidden to the slave.'"</p>

<p id="id01074">This ingenuous confession might have provoked any other man than
the caliph; but it completely appeased that prince. He commanded
her to rise, and making her sit by him, "Tell me your story,"
said he, "from the beginning to the end." She did so, with
artless simplicity, passing slightly over what regarded Zobeide,
and enlarging on the obligations she owed to Ganem; but above
all, she highly extolled his discretion, endeavouring by that
means to make the caliph sensible that she had been under the
necessity of remaining concealed in Ganem's house, to deceive
Zobeide. She concluded with the young merchant's escape, which
she plainly told the caliph she had compelled him to, that he
might avoid his indignation.</p>

<p id="id01075">When she had done speaking, the caliph said to her, "I believe
all you have told me; but why was it so long before you let me
hear from you? Was there any need of staying a whole month after
my return, before you sent me word where you were?" "Commander of
the true believers," answered Fetnah, "Ganem went abroad so very
seldom, that you need not wonder we were not the first that heard
of your return. Besides, Ganem, who took upon him to deliver the
letter I wrote to Nouron Nihar, was a long time before he could
find an opportunity of putting it into her own hands."</p>

<p id="id01076">"It is enough, Fetnah," replied the caliph; "I acknowledge my
fault, and would willingly make amends for it, by heaping favours
on the young merchant of Damascus. Consider, therefore, what I
can do for him. Ask what you think fit, and I will grant it."
Hereupon the favourite fell down at the caliph's feet, with her
face to the ground; and rising again, said, "Commander of the
true believers, after returning your majesty thanks for Ganem, I
most humbly entreat you to cause it to be published throughout
your do minions, that you pardon the son of Abou Ayoub, and that
he may safely come to you." "I must do more," rejoined the
prince, "in requital for having saved your life, and the respect
he has strewn for me, to make amends for the loss of his fortune.
In short, to repair the wrong I have done to himself and his
family, I give him to you for a husband." Fetnah had no words
expressive enough to thank the caliph for his generosity: she
then withdrew into the apartment she had occupied before her
melancholy adventure. The same furniture was still in it, nothing
had been removed; but that which pleased her most was, to find
Ganem's chests and bales, which Mesrour had received the caliph's
orders to convey thither.</p>

<p id="id01077">The next day Haroon al Rusheed ordered the grand vizier, to cause
proclamation to be made throughout all his dominions, that he
pardoned Ganem the son of Abou Ayoub; but this proved of no
effect, for a long time elapsed without any news of the young
merchant. Fetnah concluded, that he had not been able to survive
the pain of losing her. A dreadful uneasiness seized her mind;
but as hope is the last thing which forsakes lovers, she
entreated the caliph to give her leave to seek for Ganem herself;
which being granted, she took a purse containing a thousand
pieces of gold, and went one morning out of the palace, mounted
on a mule from the caliph's stables, very richly caparisoned.
Black eunuchs attended her, with a hand placed on each side of
the mule's back.</p>

<p id="id01078">Thus she went from mosque to mosque, bestowing her alms among the
devotees of the Mahummedan religion, desiring their prayers for
the accomplishment of an affair, on which the happiness of two
persons, she told them, depended. She spend the whole day and the
thousand pieces of gold in giving alms at the mosques, and
returned to the palace in the evening.</p>

<p id="id01079">The next day she took another purse of the same value, and in the like
equipage as the day before, went to the square of the jewellers'
shops, and stopping at the gateway without alighting, sent one of her
black eunuchs for the syndic or chief of them. The syndic, who was a
most charitable man, and spent above two-thirds of his income in
relieving poor strangers, sick or in distress, did not make Fetnah
wait, knowing by her dress that she was a lady belonging to the
palace. "I apply myself to you," said she, putting the purse into his
hands, "as a person whose piety is celebrated throughout the city. I
desire you to distribute that gold among the poor strangers you
relieve, for I know you make it your business to assist those who
apply to your charity. I am also satisfied that you prevent their
wants, and that nothing is more grateful to you, than to have an
opportunity of relieving their misery." "Madam," answered the syndic,
"I shall obey your commands with pleasure; but if you desire to
exercise your charity in person, and will be pleased to step to my
house, you will there see two women worthy of your compassion; I met
them yesterday as they were coming into the city; they were in a
deplorable condition, and it moved me the more, because I thought they
were persons of rank. Through all the rags that covered them,
notwithstanding the impression the sun has made on their faces, I
discovered a noble air, not to be commonly found in those people I
relieve. I carried them both to my house, and delivered them to my
wife, who was of the same opinion with me. She caused her slaves to
provide them good beds, whilst she herself led them to our warm bath,
and gave them clean linen. We know not as yet who they are, because we
wish to let them take some rest before we trouble them with our
questions."</p>

<p id="id01080">Fetnah, without knowing why, felt a curiosity to see them. The
syndic would have conducted her to his house, but she would not
give him the trouble, and was satisfied that a slave should shew
her the way. She alighted at the door, and followed the syndic's
slave, who was gone before to give notice to his mistress, she
being then in the chamber with Jalib al Koolloob and her mother,
for they were the persons the syndic had been speaking of to
Fetnah.</p>

<p id="id01081">The syndic's wife being informed by the slave, that a lady from
the palace was in her house, was hastening to meet her; but
Fetnah, who had followed the slave, did not give her time: on her
coming into the chamber, the syndic's wife prostrated herself
before her, to express the respect she had for all who belonged
to the caliph. Fetnah raised her up, and said, "My good lady, I
desire you will let me speak with those two strangers that
arrived at Bagdad last night." "Madam," answered the syndic's
wife, "they lie in those beds you see by each other." The
favourite immediately drew near the mother's, and viewing her
carefully, "Good woman," said she, "I come to offer you my
assistance: I have considerable interest in this city, and may be
of service to you and your companion." "Madam," answered Ganem's
mother, "I perceive by your obliging offers, that Heaven has not
quite forsaken us, though we had cause to believe it had, after
so many misfortunes as have befallen us." Having uttered these
words, she wept so bitterly that Fetnah and the syndic's wife
could not forbear letting fall some tears.</p>

<p id="id01082">The caliph's favourite having dried up hers, said to Ganem's
mother, "Be so kind as to tell us your misfortunes, and recount
your story. You cannot make the relation to any persons better
disposed to use all possible means to comfort you." "Madam,"
replied Abou Ayoub's disconsolate widow, "a favourite of the
commander of the true believers, a lady whose name is Fetnah, is
the occasion of all our misfortunes." These words were like a
thunderbolt to the favourite; but suppressing her agitation and
concern, she suffered Ganem's mother to proceed in the following
manner: "I am the widow of Abou Ayoub, a merchant of Damascus; I
had a son called Ganem, who, coming to trade at Bagdad, has been
accused of carrying off Fetnah. The caliph caused search to be
made for him every where, to put him to death; but not finding
him, he wrote to the king of Damascus, to cause our house to be
plundered and razed, and to expose my daughter and myself three
days successively, naked, to the populace, and then to banish us
out of Syria for ever. But how unworthy soever our usage has
been, I should be still comforted were my son alive, and I could
meet with him. What a pleasure would it be for his sister and me
to see him again! Embracing him we should forget the loss of our
property, and all the evils we have suffered on his account.
Alas! I am fully persuaded he is only the innocent cause of them;
and that he is no more guilty towards the caliph than his sister
and myself."</p>

<p id="id01083">"No doubt of it," said Fetnah, interrupting her there, "he is no
more guilty than you are; I can assure you of his innocence; for
I am that very Fetnah, you so much complain of; who, through some
fatality in my stars, have occasioned you so many misfortunes. To
me you must impute the loss of your son, if he is no more; but if
I have occasioned your misfortune, I can in some measure relieve
it. I have already justified Ganem to the caliph; who has caused
it to be proclaimed throughout his dominions, that he pardons the
son of Abou Ayoub; and doubt not he will do you as much good as
he has done you injury. You are no longer his enemies. He waits
for Ganem, to requite the service he has done me, by uniting our
fortunes; he gives me to him for his consort, therefore look on
me as your daughter, and permit me to vow eternal duty and
affection." Having so said, she bowed down on Ganem's mother,
who was so astonished that she could return no answer. Fetnah
held her long in her arms, and only left her to embrace the
daughter, who, sitting up, held out her arms to receive her.</p>

<p id="id01084">When the caliph's favourite had strewn the mother and daughter
all tokens of affection, as Ganem's wife, she said to them, "The
wealth Ganem had in this city is not lost, it is in my apartment
in the palace; but I know all the treasure of the world cannot
comfort you without Ganem, if I may judge of you by myself. Blood
is no less powerful than love in great minds; but why should we
despair of seeing him again? We shall find him; the happiness of
meeting with you makes me conceive fresh hopes. Perhaps this is
the last day of your sufferings, and the beginning of a greater
felicity than you enjoyed in Damascus, when Ganem was with you."</p>

<p id="id01085">Fetnah would have proceeded, but the syndic of the jewellers coming in
interrupted her: "Madam," said he to her, "I come from seeing a very
moving object, it is a young man, whom a camel-driver had just carried
to an hospital: he was bound with cords on a camel, because he had not
strength enough to sit. They had already unbound him, and were
carrying him into the hospital, when I happened to pass by. I went up
to the young man, viewed him attentively, and fancied his countenance
was not altogether unknown to me. I asked him some questions
concerning his family and his country; but all the answers I could get
were sighs and tears. I took pity on him, and being so much used to
sick people, perceived that he had need to have particular care taken
of him. I would not permit him to be put into the hospital; for I am
too well acquainted with their way of managing the sick, and am
sensible of the incapacity of the physicians. I have caused him to be
brought to my own house, by my slaves; and they are now in a private
room where I placed him, putting on some of my own linen, and treating
him as they would do myself."</p>

<p id="id01086">Fetnah's heart beat at these words of the jeweller, and she felt
a sudden emotion, for which she could not account: "Shew me,"
said she to the syndic, "into the sick man's room; I should be
glad to see him." The syndic conducted her, and whilst she was
going thither, Ganem's mother said to Jalib al Koolloob, "Alas!
daughter, wretched as that sick stranger is, your brother, if he
be living, is not perhaps in a more happy condition."</p>

<p id="id01087">The caliph's favourite coming into the chamber of the sick
stranger, drew near the bed, in which the syndic's slaves had
already laid him. She saw a young man, whose eyes were closed,
his countenance pale, disfigured, and bathed in tears. She gazed
earnestly on him, her heart beat, and she fancied she beheld
Ganem; but yet she would not believe her eyes. Though she found
something of Ganem in the objets she beheld, yet in other
respects he appeared so different, that she durst not imagine it
was he that lay before her. Unable, however, to withstand the
earnest desire of being satisfied, "Ganem," said she, with a
trembling voice, "is it you I behold?" Having spoken these words,
she stopped to give the young man time to answer, but observing
that he seemed insensible; "Alas! Ganem," added she, "it is not
you that I address! My imagination being overcharged with your
image, has given to a stranger a deceitful resemblance. The son
of Abou Ayoub, however indisposed, would know the voice of
Fetnah." At the name of Fetnah, Ganem (for it was really he)
opened his eyes, sprang up, and knowing the caliph's favourite;
"Ah! madam," said he, "by what miracle"  He could say no more;
such a sudden transport of joy seized him that he fainted away.
Fetnah and the syndic did all they could to bring him to himself;
but as soon as they perceived he began to revive, the syndic
desired the lady to withdraw, lest the sight of her should
heighten his disorder.</p>
