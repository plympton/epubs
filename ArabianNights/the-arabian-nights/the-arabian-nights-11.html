<p id="id03932">Prince Perviz was as much afflicted at the death of prince Bahman
as the princess; but not to waste time in needless regret, as he
knew that she still passionately desired possession of the
speaking bird, the singing tree, and the golden water, he
interrupted her, saying, "Sister, our regret for our brother is
vain and useless; our grief and lamentations cannot restore him
to life; it is the will of God, we must submit to it, and adore
the decrees of the Almighty without searching into them. Why
should you now doubt of the truth of what the holy woman told
you? do you think she spoke to you of three things that were not
in being? and that she invented them on purpose to deceive you,
who had given her no cause to do so, but received her with so
much goodness and civility? Let us rather believe that our
brother's death is owing to some error on his part, or some
accident which we cannot conceive. It ought not therefore to
prevent us from pursuing our object. I offered to go this
journey, and am now more resolved than ever; his example has no
effect upon my resolution; to-morrow I will depart."</p>

<p id="id03933">The princess did all she could to dissuade prince Perviz,
conjuring him not to expose her to the danger of losing two
brothers; but he was obstinate, and all the remonstrances she
could urge had no effect upon him. Before he went, that she might
know what success he had, he left her a string of a hundred
pearls, telling her, that if they would not run when she should
count them upon the string, but remain fixed, that would be a
certain sign he had undergone the same fate as his brother; but
at the same time told her he hoped it would never happen, but
that he should have the happiness to see her again to their
mutual satisfaction.</p>

<p id="id03934">Prince Perviz, on the twentieth day after his departure, met the
same dervish in the same place as his brother Bahman had done
before him. He went directly up to him, and after he had saluted,
asked him, if he could tell him where to find the speaking bird,
the singing tree, and the golden water? The dervish urged the
same difficulties and remonstrances as he had done to prince
Bahman, telling him, that a young gentleman, who very much
resembled him, was with him a short time before; that, overcome
by his importunity and pressing instances, he had shewn him the
way, given him a guide, and told him how he should act to
succeed; but that he had not seen him since, and doubted not but
he had shared the same fate as all other adventurers.</p>

<p id="id03935">"Good dervish," answered prince Perviz, "I know whom you speak
of; he was my elder brother, and I am informed of the certainty
of his death, but know not the cause." "I can tell you," replied
the dervise; "he was changed into a black stone, as all I speak
of have been; and you must expect the same transformation, unless
you observe more exactly than he has done the advice I gave him,
in case you persist in your resolution, which I once more entreat
you to renounce."</p>

<p id="id03936">"Dervish," said prince Perviz, "I cannot sufficiently express how
much I am obliged for the concern you take in my life, who am a
stranger to you, and have done nothing to deserve your kindness:
but I thoroughly considered this enterprise before I undertook
it, and I cannot now relinquish it: therefore I beg of you to do
me the same favour you have done my brother. Perhaps I may have
better success in following your directions." "Since I cannot
prevail with you," said the dervish, "to give up your obstinate
resolution, if my age did not prevent me, and I could stand, I
would get up to reach you a bowl I have here, which will shew you
the way."</p>

<p id="id03937">Without giving the dervish time to say more, the prince alighted
from his horse and went to the dervish, who had taken a bowl out
of his bag, in which he had a great many, and gave it him, with
the same directions he had given prince Bahman; and after warning
him not to be discouraged by the voices he should hear without
seeing any body, however threatening they might be, but to
continue his way up the hill till he saw the cage and bird, he
let him depart.</p>

<p id="id03938">Prince Perviz thanked the dervish, and when he had remounted, and
taken leave, threw the bowl before his horse, and spurring him at
the same time, followed it. When the bowl came to the bottom of
the hill it stopped, the prince alighted, and stood some time to
recollect the dervish's directions. He encouraged himself, and
began to walk up with a resolution to reach the summit; but
before he had gone above six steps, he heard a voice, which
seemed to be near, as of a man behind him, say in an insulting
tone, "Stay, rash youth, that I may punish you for your
presumption."</p>

<p id="id03939">Upon this affront the prince, forgetting the dervish's advice,
clapped his hand upon his sword, drew it, and turned about to
revenge himself; but had scarcely time to see that nobody
followed him before he and his horse were changed into black
stones.</p>

<p id="id03940">In the mean time the princess Perie-zadeh, several times a day
after her brother's departure, counted her chaplet. She did not
omit it at night, but when she went to bed put it about her neck;
and in the morning when she awoke counted over the pearls again
to see if they would slide.</p>

<p id="id03941">The day that prince Perviz was transformed into a stone, she was
counting over the pearls as she used to do, when all at once they
became immoveably fixed, a certain token that the prince her
brother was dead. As she had determined what to do in case it
should so happen, she lost no time in outward demonstrations of
grief, which she concealed as much as possible; but having
disguised herself in man's apparel, armed and equipped, she
mounted her horse the next morning, having told her servants she
should return in two or three days, and took the same road her
brothers had done.</p>

<p id="id03942">The princess, who had been used to ride on horseback in hunting,
supported the fatigue of so long a journey better than most
ladies could have done; and as she made the same stages as her
brothers, she also met with the dervish on the twentieth day.
When she came near him, she alighted off her horse, leading him
by the bridle, went and sat down by the dervish, and after she
had saluted him, said, "Good dervish, give me leave to rest
myself; and do me the favour to tell me if you have not heard
that there are somewhere in this neighbourhood a speaking bird, a
singing tree, and golden water."</p>

<p id="id03943">"Princess," answered the dervish, "for so I must call you, since
by your voice I know you to be a woman disguised in man's
apparel, I thank you for your compliment, and receive the honour
you do me with great pleasure. I know the place well where these
things are to be found: but what makes you ask me this question?"</p>

<p id="id03944">"Good dervish," replied the princess, "I have had such a
flattering relation of them given me, that I have a great desire
to possess them." "Madam," replied the dervish, "you have been
told the truth. These curiosities are more singular and
surprising than they have been represented to you: but you have
not been made acquainted with the difficulties which must be
surmounted in order to obtain them. If you had been fully
informed of these, you would not have undertaken so troublesome
and dangerous an enterprise. Take my advice, go no farther,
return, and do not urge me to contribute towards your ruin."</p>

<p id="id03945">"Good father," said the princess, "I have travelled a great way,
and should be sorry to return without executing my design. You
talk of difficulties, and danger of life; but you do not tell me
what those difficulties are, and wherein the danger consists.
This is what I desire to know, that I may consider and judge
whether I can trust my courage and strength to brave them."</p>

<p id="id03946">The dervish repeated to the princess what he had said to the
princes Bahman and Perviz, exaggerating the difficulties of
climbing up to the top of the mountain, where she was to make
herself mistress of the bird, which would inform her of the
singing tree and golden water. He magnified the noise and din of
the terrible threatening voices which she would hear on all sides
of her, without seeing any body, and the great number of black
stones, alone sufficient to strike terror. He entreated her to
reflect that those stones were so many brave gentlemen, so
metamorphosed for having omitted to observe the principal
condition of success in the perilous undertaking, which was not
to look behind them before they had got possession of the cage.</p>

<p id="id03947">When the dervish had done, the princess replied, "By what I
comprehend from your discourse, the difficulties of succeeding in
this affair are, first, the getting up to the cage without being
frightened at the terrible din of voices I shall hear; and
secondly, not to look behind me: for this last, I hope I shall be
mistress enough of myself to observe it. As to the first, I own
that those voices, such as you represent them to be, are capable
of striking terror into the most undaunted; but as in all
enterprises and dangers every one may use stratagem, I desire to
know of you if I may use any in one of so great importance." "And
what stratagem is it you would employ?" said the dervish. "To
stop my ears with cotton," answered the princess, "that the
voices, however loud and terrible, may make the less impression
upon my imagination, and my mind remain free from that
disturbance which might cause me to lose the use of my reason."</p>

<p id="id03948">"Princess," replied the dervish, "of all the persons who have
addressed themselves to me for information, I do not know that
ever one made use of the contrivance you propose. All I know is,
that they all perished. If you persist in your design, you may
make the experiment. You will be fortunate if it succeeds; but I
would advise you not to expose yourself to the danger."</p>

<p id="id03949">"My good father," replied the princess, "nothing can hinder my
persisting in my design. I am sure my precaution will succeed,
and am resolved to try the experiment. Nothing remains for me but
to know which way I must go; I conjure you not to deny me the
favour of that information." The dervish exhorted her again, for
the last time, to consider well what she was going to do; but
finding her resolute, he took out a bowl, and presenting it to
her, said, "Take this bowl; mount your horse again, and when you
have thrown it before you, follow it through all its windings,
till it stops at the bottom of the mountain, there alight, and
ascend the hill. Go; you know the rest."</p>

<p id="id03950">After the princess had thanked the dervish, and taken her leave
of him, she mounted her horse, threw the bowl before her, and
followed it till it stopped at the foot of the mountain.</p>

<p id="id03951">The princess alighted, stopped her ears with cotton; and after
she had well examined the path leading to the summit, began with
a moderate pace, and walked up with intrepidity. She heard the
voices, and perceived the great service the cotton was to her.
The higher she went, the louder and more numerous the voices
seemed; but they were not capable of making any impression upon
her. She heard a great many affronting speeches and raillery very
disagreeable to a woman, which she only laughed at. "I mind not,"
said she to herself, "all that can be said, were it worse; I only
laugh at them, and shall pursue my way." At last she got so high,
that she could perceive the cage and the bird, which endeavoured,
with the voices, to frighten her, crying in a thundering tone,
notwithstanding the smallness of its size, "Retire, fool, and
approach no nearer."</p>

<p id="id03952">The princess, encouraged by this object, redoubled her speed, and
by effort gained the summit of the mountain, where the ground was
level; then running directly to the cage, and clapping her hand
upon it, cried, "Bird, I have you, and you shall not escape me."</p>

<p id="id03953">While Perie-zadeh was pulling the cotton out of her ears, the
bird said to her, "Heroic princess, be not angry with me for
joining with those who exerted themselves to preserve my liberty.
Though in a cage, I was content with my condition; but since I am
destined to be a slave, I would rather be yours than any other
person's, since you have obtained me so courageously. From this
instant, I swear inviolable fidelity, and an entire submission to
all your commands. I know who you are; you do not: but the time
will come when I shall do you essential service, which I hope you
will think yourself obliged to me for. As a proof of my
sincerity, tell me what you desire, and I am ready to obey you."</p>

<p id="id03954">The princess's joy was the more inexpressible, because the
conquest she had made had cost her the lives of two beloved
brothers, and given her more trouble and danger than she could
have imagined, notwithstanding what the dervish had represented
to her. "Bird," said she, "it was my intention to have told you
that I wish for many things which are of importance; but I am
overjoyed that you have shewn your good-will and prevented me. I
have been told that there is not far off a golden water, the
property of which is very wonderful; before all things, I ask you
to tell me where it is." The bird shewed her the place, which was
just by, and she went and filled a little silver flagon which she
had brought with her. She returned to the bird and said, "Bird,
this is not enough; I want also the singing tree; tell me where
it is." "Turn about," said the bird, "and you will see behind you
a wood, where you will find this tree." The princess went into
the wood, and by the harmonious concert she heard soon knew the
tree among many others, but it was very large and high. She came
back to the bird, and said to it, "Bird, I have found the singing
tree, but I can neither pull it up by the roots, nor carry it."
The bird replied, "It is not necessary that you should take it up
by the roots; it will be sufficient to break off a branch, and
carry it to plant in your garden; it will take root as soon as it
is put into the earth, and in a little time will grow to as fine
a tree as that you have seen."</p>

<p id="id03955">When the princess had obtained possession of the three things
which the devout woman had told her of, and for which she had
conceived so great a desire, she said again to the bird, "Bird,
what you have yet done for me is not sufficient. You have been
the cause of the death of my two brothers, who must be among the
black stones which I saw as I ascended the mountain. I wish to
take them home with me."</p>

<p id="id03956">The bird seemed reluctant to satisfy the princess in this point,
and indeed made some difficulty to comply. "Bird," said the
princess, "remember you told me that you were my slave. You are
so; and your life is in my disposal." "That I cannot deny,"
answered the bird; "but although what you now ask is more
difficult than all the rest, yet I will do it for you. Cast your
eyes around," added he, "and look if you can see a little
pitcher." "I see it already," said the princess. "Take it then,"
said he, "and as you descend the mountain, sprinkle a little of
the water that is in it upon every black stone."</p>

<p id="id03957">The princess took up the pitcher accordingly, carried with her
the cage and bird, the flagon of golden water, and the branch of
the singing tree, and as she descended the mountain, threw a
little of the water on every black stone, which was changed
immediately into a man; and as she did not miss one stone, all
the horses, both of the princes her brothers, and of the other
gentlemen, resumed their natural forms. She instantly recognized
Bahman and Perviz, as they did her, and ran to embrace her. She
returned their embraces, and expressed her amazement. "What do
you here, my dear brothers?" said she; they told her they had
been asleep. "Yes," replied she, "and if it had not been for me,
perhaps you might have slept till the day of judgment. Do not you
remember that you came to fetch the speaking bird, the singing
tree, and the yellow water? and did not you see, as you came
along, the place covered with black stones? Look and see if there
be any now. The gentlemen and their horses who surround us, and
you yourselves, were these black stones. If you desire to know
how this wonder was performed," continued she, shewing the
pitcher, which she set down at the foot of the mountain, having
no further use for it, "it was done by virtue of the water which
was in this pitcher, with which I sprinkled every stone. After I
had made the speaking bird (which you see in this cage) my slave,
by his directions I found out the singing tree, a branch of which
I have now in my hand; and the yellow water, which this flagon is
filled with; but being still unwilling to return without taking
you with me, I constrained the bird, by the power I had over him,
to afford me the means. He told me where to find this pitcher,
and the use I was to make of it."</p>

<p id="id03958">The princes Bahman and Perviz learnt by this relation the
obligation they had to the princess their sister; as did all the
other gentlemen, who were collected round, and expressed to the
princess, that, far from envying her happiness in the conquest
she had made, and which they all had aspired to, they thought
they could not any otherwise acknowledge the favour she had done
them, or better express their gratitude to her for restoring them
to life again, than by declaring themselves all her slaves, and
that they were ready to obey her in whatever she should command.</p>

<p id="id03959">"Gentlemen," replied the princess, "if you had given any
attention to my words you might have observed that I had no other
intention in what I have done than to recover my brothers;
therefore, if you have received any benefit, you owe me no
obligation, and I have no further share in your compliment than
your politeness towards me, for which I return you my thanks. In
other respects, I regard each of you individually as free as you
were before your misfortunes, and I rejoice with you at the
happiness which has accrued to you by my means. Let us however
stay no longer in a place where we have nothing to detain us; but
mount our horses, and return to our respective homes."</p>

<p id="id03960">The princess took her horse, which stood in the place where she
had left him.&#8212;Before she mounted, prince Bahman desired her to
give him the cage to carry. "Brother," replied the princess, "the
bird is my slave, and I will carry him myself; if you will take
the pains to carry the branch of the singing tree, there it is;
only hold the cage while I get on horseback." When she had
mounted her horse; and prince Bahman had given her the cage, she
turned about and said to prince Perviz, "I leave the flagon of
golden water to your care, if it will not be too much trouble for
you to carry it." Prince Perviz took charge of it with pleasure.</p>

<p id="id03961">When Bahman, Perviz, and all the gentlemen had mounted their
horses, the princess waited for some of them to lead the way. The
two princes paid that compliment to the gentlemen, and they again
to the princess, who, finding that none of them would accept of
the honour, but that it was reserved for her, addressed herself
to them and said, "Gentlemen, I expect that some of you should
lead the way;" to which one who was nearest to her, in the name
of the rest, replied, "Madam, were we ignorant of the respect due
to your sex, yet after what you have done for us there is no
deference we would not willingly pay you, notwithstanding your
modesty; we entreat you no longer to deprive us of the happiness
of following you."</p>

<p id="id03962">"Gentlemen," said the princess, "I do not deserve the honour you
do me, and accept it only because you desire it." At the same
time she led the way, and the two princes and the gentlemen
followed.</p>

<p id="id03963">This illustrious company called upon the dervish as they passed,
to thank him for his reception and wholesome advice, which they
had all found to be sincere. But he was dead: whether of old age,
or because he was no longer necessary to shew the way to the
obtaining the three rarities which the princess Perie-zadeh had
secured, did not appear. They pursued their route, but lessened
in their numbers every day. The gentlemen who, as we said before,
had come from different countries, after severally repeating
their obligations to the princess and her brothers, took leave of
them one after another as they approached the road they had come.</p>

<p id="id03964">As soon as the princess reached home, she placed the cage in the
garden; and the bird no sooner began to warble than he was
surrounded by nightingales, chaffinches, larks, linnets,
goldfinches, and every species of birds of the country. And the
branch of the singing tree was no sooner set in the midst of the
parterre, a little distance from the house, than it took root,
and in a short time became a large tree, the leaves of which gave
as harmonious a concert as those of the tree from which it was
gathered. A large basin of beautiful marble was placed in the
garden; and when it was finished, the princess poured into it all
the yellow water from the flagon, which instantly increased and
swelled so much that it soon reached up to the edges of the
basin, and afterwards formed in the middle a fountain twenty feet
high, which fell again into the basin perpetually without running
over.</p>

<p id="id03965">The report of these wonders was presently spread abroad, and as
the gates of the house and those of the gardens were shut to
nobody, a great number of people came to admire them.</p>

<p id="id03966">Some days after, when the princes Bahman and Perviz had recovered
from the fatigue of their journey, they resumed their former way
of living; and as their usual diversion was hunting, they mounted
their horses and went for the first time since their return, not
to their own demesne, but two or three leagues from their house.
As they pursued their sport, the emperor of Persia came in
pursuit of game upon the same ground. When they perceived by the
number of horsemen in different places that he would soon be up,
they resolved to discontinue their chase, and retire to avoid
encountering him; but in the very road they took they chanced to
meet him in so narrow a way that they could not retreat without
being seen. In their surprise they had only time to alight, and
prostrate themselves before the emperor, without lifting up their
heads to look at him. The emperor, who saw they were as well
mounted and dressed as if they had belonged to his court, had the
curiosity to see their faces. He stopped, and commanded them to
rise. The princes rose up, and stood before him with an easy and
graceful air, accompanied with respectful modest countenances.
The emperor took some time to view them before he spoke: and
after he had admired their good air and mien, asked them who they
were, and where they lived.</p>

<p id="id03967">"Sir," said prince Bahman, "we are the sons of the late intendant
of your majesty's gardens: and live in a house which he built a
little before he died, till we should be fit to serve your
majesty, and ask of you some employ when opportunity offered."</p>

<p id="id03968">"By what I perceive," replied the emperor, "you love hunting."
"Sir," replied prince Bahman, "it is our common exercise, and
what none of your majesty's subjects who intend to bear arms in
your armies ought, according to the ancient custom of the
kingdom, to neglect." The emperor, charmed with so prudent an
answer, said, "Since it is so, I should be glad to see your
expertness in the chase; choose your own game."</p>

<p id="id03969">The princes mounted their horses again, and followed the emperor;
but had not gone far before they saw many wild beasts together.
Prince Bahman chose a lion, and prince Perviz a bear; and pursued
them with so much intrepidity, that the emperor was surprised.
They came up with their game nearly at the same time, and darted
their javelins with so much skill and address, that they pierced,
the one the lion, and the other the bear, so effectually, that
the emperor saw them fall one after the other. Immediately
afterwards prince Bahman pursued another bear, and prince Perviz
another lion, and killed them in a short time, and would have
beaten out for fresh game, but the emperor would not let them,
and sent to them to come to him. When they approached he said,
"If I would have given you leave, you would soon have destroyed
all my game: but it is not that which I would preserve, but your
persons; for I am so well assured your bravery may one time or
other be serviceable to me, that from this moment your lives will
be always dear to me."</p>

<p id="id03970">The emperor, in short, conceived so great a kindness for the two
princes, that he invited them immediately to make him a visit: to
which prince Bahman replied, "Your majesty does us an honour we
do not deserve; and we beg you will excuse us."</p>

<p id="id03971">The emperor, who could not comprehend what reason the princes
could have to refuse this token of his favour, pressed them to
tell him why they excused themselves. "Sir," said prince Bahman,
"we have a sister younger than ourselves, with whom we live in
such perfect union, that we undertake nothing before we consult
her, nor she any thing without asking our advice." "I commend
your brotherly affection," answered the emperor. "Consult your
sister, meet me here tomorrow, and give me an answer."</p>

<p id="id03972">The princes went home, but neglected to speak of their adventure
in meeting the emperor, and hunting with him, and also of the
honour he had done them, by asking them to go home with him; yet
did not the next morning fail to meet him at the place appointed.
"Well," said the emperor, "have you spoken to your sister? And
has she consented to the pleasure I expect of seeing you?" The
two princes looked at each other and blushed. "Sir," said prince
Bahman, "we beg your majesty to excuse us: for both my brother
and I forgot." "Then remember to-day," replied the emperor, "and
be sure to bring me an answer to-morrow."</p>

<p id="id03973">The princes were guilty of the same fault a second time, and the
emperor was so good-natured as to forgive their negligence; but
to prevent their forgetfulness the third time, he pulled three
little golden balls out of a purse, and put them into prince
Bahman's bosom. "These balls," said he, smiling, "will prevent
your forgetting a third time what I wish you to do for my sake;
since the noise they will make by falling on the floor, when you
undress, will remind you, if you do not recollect it before." The
event happened just as the emperor foresaw; and without these
balls the princes had not thought of speaking to their sister of
this affair. For as prince Bahman unloosed his girdle to go to
bed the balls dropped on the floor, upon which he ran into prince
Perviz's chamber, when both went into the princess Perie-zadeh's
apartment, and after they had asked her pardon for coming at so
unseasonable a time, they told her all the circumstances of their
meeting the emperor.</p>

<p id="id03974">The princess was somewhat surprised at this intelligence. "Your
meeting with the emperor," said she, "is happy and honourable,
and may in the end be highly advantageous to you, but it is very
disagreeable and distrustful to me. It was on my account, I know,
you refused the emperor, and I am infinitely obliged to you for
doing so. I know by this your affection is equal to my own, since
you would rather be guilty of incivility towards the emperor than
violate the brotherly union we have sworn to each other. You
judge right, for if you had once gone you would insensibly have
been engaged to leave me, to devote yourselves to him. But do you
think it an easy matter absolutely to refuse the emperor what he
seems so earnestly to desire? Monarchs will be obeyed in their
desires, and it may be dangerous to oppose them; therefore, if to
follow my inclination I should dissuade you from shewing the
complaisance he expects from you, it may expose you to his
resentment, and may render myself and you miserable. These are my
sentiments: but before we conclude upon any thing let us consult
the speaking bird, and hear what he says; he is penetrating, and
has promised his assistance in all difficulties."</p>

<p id="id03975">The princess sent for the cage, and after she had related the
circumstances to the bird in the presence of her brothers, asked
him what they should do in this perplexity? The bird answered,
"The princes your brothers must conform to the emperor's
pleasure, and in their turn invite him to come and see your
house."</p>

<p id="id03976">"But, bird," replied the princess, "my brothers and I love one
another, and our friendship is yet undisturbed. Will not this
step be injurious to that friendship?" "Not at all," replied the
bird; "it will tend rather to cement it." "Then," answered the
princess, "the emperor will see me." The bird told her it was
necessary he should, and that everything would go better
afterwards.</p>

<p id="id03977">Next morning the princes met the emperor hunting, who, at as
great a distance as he could make himself be heard, asked them if
they had remembered to speak to their sister? Prince Bahman
approached, and answered, "Sir, your majesty may dispose of us as
you please; we are ready to obey you; for we have not only
obtained our sister's consent with great ease, but she took it
amiss that we should pay her that deference in a matter wherein
our duty to your majesty was concerned. But if we have offended,
we hope you will pardon us." "Do not be uneasy on that account,"
replied the emperor; "so far from taking amiss what you have
done, I highly approve of your conduct, and hope you will have
the same deference and attachment to my person, if I have ever so
little share in your friendship." The princes, confounded at the
emperor's goodness, returned no other answer but a low obeisance,
to shew the great respect with which they received it.</p>

<p id="id03978">The emperor, contrary to his usual custom, did not hunt long that
day. Presuming that the princes possessed wit equal to their
courage and bravery, he longed with impatience to converse with
them more at liberty. He made them ride on each side of him, an
honour which, without speaking of the principal courtiers who
accompanied him, was envied by the grand vizier, who was much
mortified to see them preferred before him.</p>

<p id="id03979">When the emperor entered his capital, the eyes of the people, who
stood in crowds in the streets, were fixed upon the two princes
Bahman and Perviz; and they were earnest to know who they might
be, whether foreigners or natives.</p>

<p id="id03980">All, however, agreed in wishing that the emperor had been blessed
with two such handsome princes, and said, "He might have had
children as old, if the queen, who had suffered the punishment of
her misfortune, had been more fortunate in her lyings-in."</p>

<p id="id03981">The first thing that the emperor did when he arrived at his
palace was to conduct the princes into the principal apartments;
who praised without affectation, like persons conversant in such
matters, the beauty and symmetry of the rooms, and the richness
of the furniture and ornaments. Afterwards a magnificent repast
was served up, and the emperor made them sit with him, which they
at first refused; but finding it was his pleasure, they obeyed.</p>

<p id="id03982">The emperor, who had himself much learning, particularly in
history, foresaw that the princes, out of modesty and respect,
would not take the liberty of beginning any conversation.
Therefore, to give them an opportunity, he furnished them with
subjects all dinner-time. But whatever subject he introduced,
they shewed so much wit, judgment, and discernment, that he was
struck with admiration. "Were these my own children," said he to
himself, "and I had improved their talents by suitable education,
they could not have been more accomplished or better informed."
In short, he took such great pleasure in their conversation, that
after having sat longer than usual he led them into his closet,
where he pursued his conversation with them, and at last said, "I
never supposed that there were among my subjects in the country
youths so well brought up, so lively, so capable; and I never was
better pleased with any conversation than yours: but it is time
now we should relax our minds with some diversion; and as nothing
is more capable of enlivening the mind than music, you shall hear
a vocal and instrumental concert which may not be disagreeable to
you."</p>

<p id="id03983">The emperor had no sooner spoken for them than the musicians, who
had orders to attend, entered, and answered fully the
expectations the princes had been led to entertain of their
abilities. After the concerts, an excellent farce was acted, and
the entertainment was concluded by dancers of both sexes.</p>

<p id="id03984">The two princes seeing night approach, prostrated themselves at
the emperor's feet; and having first thanked him for the favours
and honours he had heaped upon them, asked his permission to
retire; which was granted by the emperor, who, in dismissing
them, said, "I give you leave to go; but remember I brought you
to the palace myself only to shew you the way; you will be always
welcome, and the oftener you come the greater pleasure you will
do me."</p>

<p id="id03985">Before they went out of the emperor's presence, prince Bahman
said, "Sir, may we presume to request that your majesty will do
us and our sister the honour to pass by our house, and rest and
refresh yourself after your fatigue, the first time you take the
diversion of hunting in that neighbourhood? It is not worthy your
presence; but monarchs sometimes have vouchsafed to take shelter
in a cottage." "My children," replied the emperor; "your house
cannot be otherwise than beautiful, and worthy of its owners. I
will call and see it with pleasure, which will be the greater for
having for my hosts you and your sister, who is already dear to
me from the account you give me of the rare qualities with which
she is endowed; and this satisfaction I will defer no longer than
to-morrow. Early in the morning I will be at the place where I
shall never forget that I first saw you. Meet me, and you shall
be my guides."</p>

<p id="id03986">When the princes Bahman and Perviz had returned home, they gave
the princess an account of the distinguished reception the
emperor had given them; and told her that they had invited him to
do them the honour, as he passed by, to call at their house; and
that he had appointed the next day.</p>

<p id="id03987">"If it be so," replied the princess, "we must think of preparing
a repast fit for his majesty; and for that purpose I think it
would be proper we should consult the speaking bird, he will tell
us perhaps what meats the emperor likes best." The princes
approved of her plan, and after they had retired she consulted
the bird alone. "Bird," said she, "the emperor will do us the
honour to-morrow to come and see our house, and we are to
entertain him; tell us what we shall do to acquit ourselves to
his satisfaction."</p>

<p id="id03988">"Good mistress," replied the bird, "you have excellent cooks, let
them do the best they can; but above all things, let them prepare
a dish of cucumbers stuffed full of pearls, which must be set
before the emperor in the first course before all the other
dishes."</p>

<p id="id03989">"Cucumbers stuffed full of pearls!" cried princess Perie-zadeh,
with amazement; "surely, bird, you do not know what you say; it
is an unheard-of dish. The emperor may admire it as a piece of
magnificence, but he will sit down to eat, and not to admire
pearls; besides, all the pearls I possess are not enough for such
a dish."</p>

<p id="id03990">"Mistress," said the bird, "do what I say, and be not uneasy
about what may happen. Nothing but good will follow. As for the
pearls, go early to-morrow morning to the foot of the first tree
on your right hand in the park, dig under it, and you will find
more than you want."</p>

<p id="id03991">That night the princess ordered a gardener to be ready to attend
her, and the next morning early led him to the tree which the
bird had told her of, and bade him dig at its foot. When the
gardener came to a certain depth, he found some resistance to the
spade, and presently discovered a gold box about a foot square,
which he shewed the princess. "This," said she, "is what I
brought you for; take care not to injure it with the spade."</p>

<p id="id03992">When the gardener took up the box, he gave it into the princess's
hands, who, as it was only fastened with neat little hasps, soon
opened it, and found it full of pearls of a moderate size, but
equal, and fit for the use that was to be made of them. Very well
satisfied with having found this treasure, after she had shut the
box again she put it under her arm, and went back to the house,
while the gardener threw the earth into the hole at the foot of
the tree as it had been before.</p>

<p id="id03993">The princes Bahman and Perviz, who, as they were dressing
themselves in their own apartments, saw the princess their sister
in the garden earlier than usual, as soon as they could get out
went to her, and met her as she was returning, with a gold box
under her arm, which much surprised them. "Sister," said Bahman,
"you carried nothing with you when we saw you before with the
gardener, and now we see you have a golden box: is this some
treasure found by the gardener, and did he come and tell you of
it?"</p>

<p id="id03994">"No, brother," answered the princess; "I took the gardener to the
place where this casket was concealed, and shewed him where to
dig: but you will be more amazed when you see what it contains."</p>

<p id="id03995">The princess opened the box, and when the princes saw that it was
full of pearls, which, though small, were of great value; they
asked her how she came to the knowledge of this treasure?
"Brothers," said she, "if nothing more pressing calls you
elsewhere, come with me, and I will tell you." "What more
pressing business," said prince Perviz, "can we have than to be
informed of what concerns us so much? We have nothing to do to
prevent our attending you." The princess, as they returned to the
house, gave them an account of her having consulted the bird, as
they had agreed she should, and the answer he had given her; the
objection she had raised to preparing a dish of cucumbers stuffed
full of pearls, and how he had told her where to find this box.
The princes and princess formed many conjectures to penetrate
into what the bird could mean by ordering them to prepare such a
dish; and after much conversation, though they could not by any
means guess at his reason, they nevertheless agreed to follow his
advice exactly.</p>

<p id="id03996">As soon as the princess entered the house, she called for the
head cook; and after she had given him directions about the
entertainment for the emperor, said to him, "Besides all this,
you must dress an extraordinary dish for the emperor's own
eating, which nobody else must have any thing to do with besides
yourself. This dish must be of cucumbers stuffed with these
pearls;" and at the same time she opened him the box, and shewed
him the pearls.</p>

<p id="id03997">The chief cook, who had never heard of such a dish, started back,
and shewed his thoughts by his looks; which the princess
penetrating, said, "I see you take me to be mad to order such a
dish, which you never heard of, and which one may say with
certainty was never made. I know this as well as you; but I am
not mad, and give you these orders with the most perfect
recollection. You must invent and do the best you can, and bring
me back what pearls are left." The cook could make no reply, but
took the box and retired: and afterwards the princess gave
directions to all the domestics to have every thing in order,
both in the house and gardens, to receive the emperor.</p>

<p id="id03998">Next day the two princes went to the place appointed; and as soon
as the emperor of Persia arrived the chase began, which lasted
till the heat of the sun obliged him to leave off. While prince
Bahman stayed to conduit the emperor to their house, prince
Perviz rode before to shew the way, and when he came in sight of
the house, spurred his horse, to inform the princess Perie-zadeh
that the emperor was approaching; but she had been told by some
servants whom she had placed to give notice, and the prince found
her waiting ready to receive him.</p>

<p id="id03999">When the emperor had entered the court-yard, and alighted at the
portico, the princess came and threw herself at his feet, and the
two princes informed him she was their sister, and besought him
to accept her respects.</p>

<p id="id04000">The emperor stooped to raise her, and after he had gazed some
time on her beauty, struck with her fine person and dignified
air, he said, "The brothers are worthy of the sister, and she
worthy of them; since, if I may judge of her understanding by her
person, I am not amazed that the brothers would do nothing
without their sister's consent; but," added he, "I hope to be
better acquainted with you, my daughter, after I have seen the
house."</p>

<p id="id04001">"Sir," said the princess, "it is only a plain country residence,
fit for such people as we are, who live retired from the great
world. It is not to be compared with houses in great cities, much
less with the magnificent palaces of emperors." "I cannot
perfectly agree with you in opinion," said the emperor very
obligingly, "for its first appearance makes me suspect you;
however, I will not pass my judgment upon it till I have seen it
all; therefore be pleased to conduct me through the apartments."</p>

<p id="id04002">The princess led the emperor through all the rooms except the
hall; and, after he had considered them very attentively and
admired their variety, "My daughter," said he to the princess,
"do you call this a country house? The finest and largest cities
would soon be deserted, if all country houses were like yours. I
am no longer surprised that you take so much delight in it, and
despise the town. Now let me see the garden, which I doubt not is
answerable to the house."</p>

<p id="id04003">The princess opened a door which led into the garden; and the
first object which presented itself to the emperor's view was the
golden fountain. Surprised at so rare an object, he asked from
whence that wonderful water, which gave so much pleasure to
behold, had been procured; where was its source; and by what art
it was made to play so high, that he thought nothing in the world
was to be compared to it? He said he would presently take a
nearer view of it.</p>

<p id="id04004">The princess then led him to the spot where the harmonious tree
was planted; and there the emperor heard a concert, different
from all he had ever heard before; and stopping to see where the
musicians were, he could discern nobody far or near; but still
distinctly heard the music, which ravished his senses. "My
daughter," said he to the princess, "where are the musicians whom
I hear? Are they under ground, or invisible in the air? Such
excellent performers will hazard nothing by being seen; on the
contrary, they would please the more."</p>

<p id="id04005">"Sir," answered the princess smiling, "they are not musicians,
but the leaves of the trees your majesty sees before you, which
form this concert; and if you will give yourself the trouble to
go a little nearer, you will be convinced, and the voices will be
the more distinct."</p>

<p id="id04006">The emperor went nearer, and was so charmed with the sweet
harmony, that he would never have been tired with hearing it, but
that his desire to have a nearer view of the fountain of yellow
water forced him away. "Daughter," said he, "tell me, I pray you,
whether this wonderful tree was found in your garden by chance,
or was a present made to you, or have you procured it from some
foreign country? It must certainly have come from a great
distance, otherwise, curious as I am after natural rarities, I
should have heard of it. What name do you call it by?"</p>

<p id="id04007">"Sir," replied the princess, "this tree has no other name than
that of the singing tree, and is not a native of this country. It
would at present take up too much time to tell your majesty by
what adventures it came here; its history is connected with the
yellow water, and the speaking bird, which came to me at the same
time, and which your majesty may see after you have taken a
nearer view of the golden water. But if it be agreeable to your
majesty, after you have rested yourself, and recovered the
fatigue of hunting, which must be the greater because of the
sun's intense heat, I will do myself the honour of relating it to
you."</p>

<p id="id04008">"My daughter," replied the emperor, "my fatigue is so well
recompensed by the wonderful things you have shewn me, that I do
not feel it the least. I think only of the trouble I give you.
Let us finish by seeing the yellow water. I am impatient to see
and admire the speaking bird."</p>

<p id="id04009">When the emperor came to the yellow water, his eyes were fixed so
steadfastly upon the fountain, that he could not take them off.
At last, addressing himself to the princess, he said, "As you
tell me, daughter, that this water has no spring or
communication, I conclude that it is foreign, as well as the
singing tree."</p>

<p id="id04010">"Sir," replied the princess, "it is as your majesty conjectures;
and to let you know that this water has no communication with any
spring, I must inform you that the basin is one entire stone, so
that the water cannot come in at the sides or underneath. But
what your majesty will think most wonderful is, that all this
water proceeded but from one small flagon, emptied into this
basin, which increased to the quantity you see, by a property
peculiar to itself, and formed this fountain." "Well," said the
emperor, going from the fountain, "this is enough for one time. I
promise myself the pleasure to come and visit it often; but now
let us go and see the speaking bird."</p>

<p id="id04011">As he went towards the hall, the emperor perceived a prodigious
number of singing birds in the trees around, filling the air with
their songs and warblings, and asked, why there were so many
there, and none on the other trees in the garden? "The reason,
sir," answered the princess, "is, because they come from all
parts to accompany the song of the speaking bird, which your
majesty may see in a cage in one of the windows of the hall we
are approaching; and if you attend, you will perceive that his
notes are sweeter than those of any of the other birds, even the
nightingale."</p>

<p id="id04012">The emperor went into the hall; and as the bird continued
singing, the princess raised her voice, and said, "My slave, here
is the emperor, pay your compliments to him." The bird left off
singing that instant, when all the other birds ceased also, and
it said, "The emperor is welcome; God prosper him, and prolong
his life." As the entertainment was served on the sofa near the
window where the bird was placed, the sultan replied, as he was
taking his seat, "Bird, I thank you, and am overjoyed to find in
you the sultan and king of birds."</p>

<p id="id04013">As soon as the emperor saw the dish of cucumbers set before him,
thinking it was stuffed in the best manner, he reached out his
hand and took one; but when he cut it, was in extreme surprise to
find it stuffed with pearls. "What novelty is this?" said he "and
with what design were these cucumbers stuffed thus with pearls,
since pearls are not to be eaten?" He looked at the two princes
and princess to ask them the meaning: when the bird interrupting
him, said, "Can your majesty be in such great astonishment at
cucumbers stuffed with pearls, which you see with your own eyes,
and yet so easily believe that the queen your wife was delivered
of a dog, a cat, and a piece of wood?" "I believed these things,"
replied the emperor, "because the midwives assured me of the
facts." "Those midwives, sir," replied the bird, "were the
queen's two sisters, who, envious of her happiness in being
preferred by your majesty before them, to satisfy their envy and
revenge, have abused your majesty's credulity. If you interrogate
them, they will confess their crime. The two brothers and the
sister whom you see before you are your own children, whom they
exposed, and who were taken in by the intendant of your gardens,
who provided nurses for them, and took care of their education."</p>

<p id="id04014">This speech of the bird's presently cleared up the emperor's
understanding. "Bird," cried he, "I believe the truth which you
discover to me. The inclination which drew me to them told me
plainly they must be my own blood. Come then, my sons, come, my
daughter, let me embrace you, and give you the first marks of a
father's love and tenderness." The emperor then rose, and after
having embraced the two princes and the princess, and mingled his
tears with theirs, said, "It is not enough, my children; you must
embrace each other, not as the children of the intendant of my
gardens, to whom I have been so much obliged for preserving your
lives, but as my own children, of the royal blood of the monarchs
of Persia, whose glory, I am persuaded, you will maintain."</p>

<p id="id04015">After the two princes and princess had embraced mutually with new
satisfaction, the emperor sat down again with them, and finished
his meal in haste; and when he had done, said, "My children, you
see in me your father; to-morrow I will bring the queen your
mother, therefore prepare to receive her."</p>

<p id="id04016">The emperor afterwards mounted his horse, and returned with
expedition to his capital. The first thing he did, as soon as he
had alighted and entered his palace, was to command the grand
vizier to seize the queen's two sisters. They were taken from
their houses separately, convicted, and condemned to be
quartered; which sentence was put in execution within an hour.</p>

<p id="id04017">In the mean time the emperor Khoosroo Shaw, followed by all the
lords of his court who were then present, went on foot to the
door of the great mosque; and after he had taken the queen out of
the strict confinement she had languished under for so many
years, embracing her in the miserable condition to which she was
then reduced, said to her with tears in his eyes, "I come to
entreat your pardon for the injustice I have done you, and to
make you the reparation I ought; which I have begun, by punishing
the unnatural wretches who put the abominable cheat upon me; and
I hope you will look upon it as complete, when I present to you
two accomplished princes, and a lovely princess, our children.
Come and resume your former rank, with all the honours which are
your due." All this was done and said before great crowds of
people, who flocked from all parts at the first news of what was
passing, and immediately spread the joyful intelligence through
the city.</p>

<p id="id04018">Next morning early the emperor and queen, whose mournful
humiliating dress was changed for magnificent robes, went with
all their court to the house built by the intendant of the
gardens, where the emperor presented the princes Bahman and
Perviz, and the princess Perie-zadeh, to their enraptured mother.
"These, much injured wife," said he, "are the two princes your
sons, and this princess your daughter; embrace them with the same
tenderness I have done, since they are worthy both of me and
you." The tears flowed plentifully down their cheeks at these
tender embraces, especially the queen's, from the comfort and joy
of having two such princes for her sons, and such a princess for
her daughter, on whose account she had so long endured the
severest afflictions.</p>

<p id="id04019">The two princes and the princess had prepared a magnificent
repast for the emperor and queen, and their court. As soon as
that was over, the emperor led the queen into the garden, and
shewed her the harmonious tree and the beautiful effect of the
yellow fountain. She had seen the bird in his cage, and the
emperor had spared no panegyric in his praise during the repast.</p>

<p id="id04020">When there was nothing to detain the emperor any longer, he took
horse, and with the princes Bahman and Perviz on his right hand,
and the queen consort and the princess at his left, preceded and
followed by all the officers of his court, according to their
rank, returned to his capital. Crowds of people came out to meet
them, and with acclamations of joy ushered them into the city,
where all eyes were fixed not only upon the queen, the two
princes, and the princess, but also upon the bird, which the
princess carried before her in his cage, admiring his sweet
notes, which had drawn all the other birds about him, which
followed him, flying from tree to tree in the country, and from
one house-top to another in the city. The princes Bahman and
Perviz, and the princess Perie-zadeh, where at length brought to
the palace with this pomp, and nothing was to be seen or heard
all that night but illuminations and rejoicings both in the
palace and in the utmost parts of the city, which lasted many
days, and were continued throughout the empire of Persia, as
intelligence of the joyful event reached the several provinces.</p>

<h2 id="id04021" style="margin-top: 4em">           STORY OF THE SULTAN OF YEMEN AND HIS THREE
                             SONS.</h2>

<p id="id04022" style="margin-top: 3em">There was in the land of Yemen (Arabia Felix) a sultan, under
whom were three tributary princes. He had four children, three
sons and a daughter. He possessed greater treasures than could be
estimated, as well as innumerable camels, horses, and flocks of
sheep; and was held in awe by all contemporary sovereigns.</p>

<p id="id04023">After a long and prosperous reign, age brought with it infirmity,
and he at length became incapable of appearing in his hall of
audience; upon which he commanded his sons to his presence, and
said to them, "My wish is to divide among you, before my death,
all my possessions, that you may be satisfied, and live in
unanimity and brotherly affection with each other, and in
obedience to my dying commands." They exclaimed, "To hear is to
obey."</p>

<p id="id04024">The sultan then said, "My will is, that the eldest be sovereign
in my room; that the second possess my treasures; and the third
every description of animals. Let no, one encroach upon another,
but all assist each other." He then caused them to sign an
agreement to abide by his bequests, and shortly afterwards was
received into the mercy of the Almighty; upon which his sons
prepared what was suitable to his dignity for his funeral. They
washed the corpse, enshrouded it, prayed over it, and having
committed it to the earth, returned to their palaces; where the
viziers, officers of state, and inhabitants of the metropolis,
high and low, rich and poor, attended to console with them on the
loss of their father. The news of the death of the sultan was
soon spread abroad into all the provinces, and deputations from
every city came to condole with the princes.</p>

<p id="id04025">After these ceremonies, the eldest prince demanded that he should
be inaugurated sultan in the room of the deceased monarch,
agreeably to his will; but this was not possible, as each of the
other brothers was ambitious of being sovereign. Contention and
disputes now arose between them for the government, till at
length the elder brother, wishing to avoid civil war, said, "Let
us go and submit to the arbitration of one of the tributary
sultans, and to let him whom he adjudges the kingdom peaceably
enjoy it." To this they assented, as did also the viziers; and
they departed, unattended, towards the capital of one of the
tributary sultans.</p>

<p id="id04026">When the princes had proceeded about half way on their journey,
they reached a verdant spot, abounding in herbage and flowers,
with a clear rivulet running through it, the convenience of which
made them halt to refresh themselves. They sat down and were
eating, when one of the brothers casting his eyes on the grass,
said, "A camel has lately passed this way loaded, half with
sweetmeats and half with grain." "True," cried another, "and he
was blind of one eye." "Yes," exclaimed the third, "and he had
lost his tail." They had scarcely concluded their remarks, when
the owner of the camel came up to them (for he had heard what
they had said, and was convinced, as they had described the beast
and his load, that they must have stopped him), crying out, that
they had stolen his camel. "We have not seen him," answered the
princes, "nor touched him." "By Allah!" replied he, "none but you
can have taken him; and if you will not deliver him up, I will
complain of you to the sultan." They rejoined, "It is well; let
us go to the sultan."</p>

<p id="id04027">When all four had reached the palace, information was given of
the arrival of the princes, and they were admitted to an
audience, the owner of the camel following, who bawled out,
"These men, my lord, by their own confession, have stolen my
property, for they described him and the load he carried."</p>

<p id="id04028">The man then related what each of the princes, had said; upon
which the sultan demanded if it was true. They answered, "My
lord, we have not seen the camel; but we chanced, as we were
sitting on the grass taking some refreshment, to observe that
part of the pasture had been grazed; upon which we supposed that
the camel must have been blind of an eye, as the grass was only
eaten on one side. We then observed the dung of a camel in one
heap on the ground, which made us agree that its tail must have
been cut off, as it is the custom for camels to shake their
tails, and scatter it abroad. On the grass where the camel had
lain down, we saw on one side flies collected in great numbers,
but none on the other: this made us conclude that one of the
panniers must have contained sweets, and the other only grain."
Upon hearing the above, the sultan said to the complainant,
"Friend, go and look for thy camel, for these observations do not
prove the theft on the accused, but only the strength of their
understandings and penetration."</p>

<p id="id04029">The sultan now ordered apartments for the princes, and directed
that they should be entertained in a manner befitting their rank;
after which he left them to their repose. In the evening, when
the usual meal was brought in, the elder prince having taken up a
cake of bread, said, "This bread, I am sure, was made by a sick
woman." The second, on tasting some kid, exclaimed, "This kid was
suckled by a bitch:" and the third cried out, "Certainly this
sultan must be illegitimate." At this instant the sultan, who had
been listening, entered hastily, and exclaimed, "Wherefore utter
ye these affronting speeches?" "Inquire," replied the princes,
"into what you have heard, and you will find all true."</p>

<p id="id04030">The sultan now retired to his haram, and on inquiry, found that
the woman who had kneaded the bread was sick. He then sent for
the shepherd, who owned that the dam of the kid having died, he
had suckled it upon a bitch. Next, in a violent passion, he
proceeded to the apartments of the sultana mother, and
brandishing his cimeter&#8212;threatened her with death, unless she
confessed whether he was son to the late sultan or not.</p>

<p id="id04031">The sultana was alarmed, and said, "To preserve my life, I must
speak truth. Know then that thou art the son of a cook. Thy
father had no male offspring, at which he was uneasy: on the same
day myself and the wife of the cook lay in, I of a daughter and
she of a son. I was fearful of the coolness of the sultan, and
imposed upon him the son of the cook for his own: that son art
thou, who now enjoyest an empire."</p>

<p id="id04032">The spurious sultan left the sultana in astonishment at the
penetration of the brothers, whom he summoned to his presence,
and inquired of them on what grounds they had founded their just
suspicions respecting the bread, the kid, and himself. "My
lord," replied the elder prince, "when I broke the cake, the
flour fell out in lumps; and hence I guessed that she who made it
had not strength to knead it sufficiently, and must have been
unwell." "It is as thou hast said," replied the sultan. "The fat
of the kid," continued the second brother, "was all next the
bone, and the flesh of every other animal but the dog has it next
the skin. Hence my surmise that it must have been suckled by a
bitch." "Thou wert right," answered the sultan; "but now for
myself."</p>

<p id="id04033">"My reason for supposing thee illegitimate," said the youngest
prince, "was, because thou didst not associate with us, who are
of the same rank with thyself. Every man has properties which he
inherits from his father, his grandfather, or his mother. From
his father, generosity, or avarice; from his grandfather, valour
or cowardice; from his mother, bashfulness or impudence." "Thou
hast spoken justly," replied the sultan; "but why came ye to ask
judgment of me, since ye are so much better able to decide
difficult questions than myself? Return home, and agree among
yourselves." The princes did so; and obeyed the will of their
father.</p>

<h2 id="id04034" style="margin-top: 4em">              STORY OF THE THREE SHARPERS AND THE
                            SULTAN.</h2>

<p id="id04035" style="margin-top: 3em">Three very ingenious sharpers who associated together, being much
distressed, agreed, in hopes of obtaining immediate relief, that
they would go to the sultan, and pretend each to superior ability
in some occupation. Accordingly they proceeded to the metropolis,
but found admission to the presence difficult; the sultan being
at a garden palace surrounded by guards, who would not let them
approach. Upon this they consulted, and agreed to feign a
quarrel, in hopes that their clamour would draw the notice of the
sultan. It did so: he commanded them to be brought before him,
inquired who they were, and the cause of their dispute. "We were
disputing," said they, "concerning the superiority of our
professions; for each of us possesses complete skill in his own."
"What are your professions?" replied the sultan. "I am," said
one, "O sovereign, a lapidary of wonderful skill." "I fear thou
art an astonishing rascal," exclaimed the sultan.</p>

<p id="id04036">"I am," said the second sharper, "a genealogist of horses." "And
I," continued the third, "a genealogist of mankind, knowing every
one's true descent; an art much more wonderful than that of
either of my companions, for no one possesses it but myself, nor
ever did before me." The sultan was astonished, but gave little
credit to their pretensions: yet he said to himself, "If these
men speak truth, they are worthy of encouragement. I will keep
them near me till I have occasion to try them; when, if they
prove their abilities, I will promote them; but if not, I will
put them to death." He then allotted them an apartment, with an
allowance of three cakes of bread and a mess of pottage daily;
but placed spies over them, fearing lest they might escape.</p>

<p id="id04037">Not long after this, a present of rarities was brought to the
sultan, among which were two precious stones; one of them
remarkably clear in its water, and the other with a flaw. The
sultan now bethought himself of the lapidary, and sent for him to
his presence, when he gave him the clear jewel to examine, and
demanded what he thought it was worth.</p>

<p id="id04038">The sharper took the stone, and with much gravity turned it
backwards and forwards in his hands, examining it with minute
attention on every part; after which he said, "My lord, this
jewel has a flaw in the very centre of it." When the sultan heard
this, he was enraged against the sharper, and gave orders to
strike off his head; saying, "This stone is free from blemish,
and yet thou pretendest it hath a flaw." The executioner now
advanced, laid hold of the sharper, bound him, and was going to
strike, when the vizier entered, and seeing the sultan enraged,
and the sharper under the cimeter, inquired the cause. Being
informed, he advanced towards the sultan, and said, "My lord, act
not thus, but first break the stone: should a flaw appear in it,
the words of this man are true; but if it be found free from
blemish, put him to death." The sultan replied, "Thy advice is
just:" and broke it in two with his mace. In the middle he found
a flaw, at which he was astonished, and exclaimed to the sharper,
"By what means couldst thou discover the blemish?" He replied,
"By the acuteness of my sight." The sultan then released him, and
said, "Take him back to his companions, allow him a mess of
pottage to himself, and two cakes of bread."</p>

<p id="id04039">Some time after this a tribute came from one of the provinces,
part of which consisted of a beautiful black colt, in colour
resembling the hue of the darkest night. The sultan was delighted
with the animal, and spent whole days in admiring him. At length
he bethought himself of the sharper who had pretended to be a
genealogist of horses, and commanded him to his presence. When he
appeared, the sultan said, "Art thou a judge of horses?" He
replied, "Yes, my lord," upon which the sultan exclaimed, "It is
well! but I swear by him who appointed me guardian of his
subjects, and said to the universe, Be! and it was, that should I
find untruth in thy declaration, I will strike off thy head." The
man replied, "To hear is to submit." After this they brought out
the colt, that he might examine him.</p>

<p id="id04040">The sharper desired the groom to mount the colt and pace him
before him, which he did backwards and forwards, the fiery animal
all the while plunging and rearing. At length the genealogist
said, "It is enough:" and turning to the sultan exclaimed, "My
lord, this colt is singularly beautiful, of true blood by his
sire, his paces exquisite and proportions just; but in him there
is one blemish; could that be done away, he would be all
perfection; nor would there be upon the face of the earth his
equal among all the various breeds of horses." "What can that
blemish be?" said the sultan. "His sire," rejoined the
genealogist, "was of true blood, but his dam of another species
of animal; and, if commanded, I will inform you." "Speak," said
the sultan. "The dam of this beautiful colt," continued the
genealogist, "was a buffalo."</p>

<p id="id04041">When the sultan heard this he flew into a rage, and commanded an
executioner to strike off the head of the sharper; exclaiming,
"Thou accursed dog! how could a buffalo bring forth a colt?" "My
lord," replied the sharper, "the executioner is in attendance;
but send for the person who presented the colt, and inquire of
him the truth. If my words prove just, my skill will be
ascertained; but if what I have said be false, then let my head
pay the forfeit for my tongue." Upon this the sultan sent for the
master of the colt to attend his presence.</p>

<p id="id04042">When the master of the colt appeared before him, the sultan
inquired whether it was purchased of another person, or had been
bred by himself? To which the man replied, "My lord, I will
relate nothing but the truth. The production of this colt is
surprising. His sire belonged to me, and was of the true breed of
sea-horses: he was always kept in an enclosure by himself, as I
was fearful of his being injured; but it happened one day in the
spring, that the groom took him for air into the country, and
picqueted him in the plain. By chance a cow-buffalo coming near
the spot, the stallion became outrageous, broke his heel-ropes,
joined the buffalo, which after the usual period of gestation,
produced this colt, to our great astonishment."</p>

<p id="id04043">The sultan was surprised at this relation. He commanded the
genealogist to be sent for, and upon his arrival said, "Thy words
have proved true, and thy wonderful skill in the breed of horses
is ascertained; but by what mark couldst thou know that the dam
of this colt was a buffalo?" The man replied, "My lord, the mark
is visible in the colt itself. It is not unknown to any person of
observation, that the hoof of a horse is nearly round, but the
hoof of a buffalo thick and longish, like this colt's: hence I
judged that the dam must certainly have been a buffalo." The
sultan now dismissed him graciously, and commanded that he should
be allowed daily a mess of pottage, and two cakes of bread.</p>

<p id="id04044">Not long after this the sultan bethought himself of the third
sharper, who pretended that he was the genealogist of man, and
sent for him to the presence. On his appearance he said, "Thou
canst trace the descent of man?" "Yes, my lord," replied the
genealogist. Upon this the sultan commanded an eunuch to take him
into his haram, that he might examine the descent of his
favourite mistress. Upon his introduction, he looked at the lady
on this side and on that, through her veil, till he was
satisfied, when he came out; and the sultan exclaimed, "Well,
what hast thou discovered in my mistress?" He replied, "My lord,
she is all perfect in elegance, beauty, grace, stature, bloom,
modesty, accomplishments, and knowledge, so that every thing
desirable centres in herself; but still there is one point that
disgraces her, from which if she was free, it is not possible she
could be excelled in anything among the whole of the fair sex."
When the sultan had heard this, he rose up angrily, and drawing
his cimeter, ran towards the genealogist, intending to strike off
his head.</p>

<p id="id04045">Just as he was going to strike, some of the attendants said, "My
lord, put not the man to death before thou art convinced of his
falsehood." Upon which the sultan exclaimed, "What fault appeared
to thee in my mistress?" "O sultan," replied the man, "she is, as
to herself, all perfect; but her mother was a rope-dancer." Upon
this the sultan immediately sent for the father of the lady, and
said, "Inform me truly who was the mother of thy daughter, or I
will put thee to death." "Mighty prince," replied the father,
"there is no safety for man but in the truth. Her mother was a
rope-dancer, whom I took when very young from a company of
strolling mummers, and educated. She grew up most beautiful and
accomplished: I married her, and she produced me the girl whom
thou hast chosen."</p>

<p id="id04046">When the sultan heard this, his rage cooled, but he was filled with
astonishment; and said to the genealogist, "Inform me what could shew
thee that my mistress was the daughter of a rope-dancer?" "My lord,"
replied the man, "this cast of people have always their eyes very
black, and their eyebrows bushy; such are hers: and from them I
guessed her descent." The sultan was now convinced of his skill,
dismissed him graciously, and commanded that he should be allowed a
mess of pottage and three cakes of bread daily, which was done
accordingly.</p>

<p id="id04047">Some time after this the sultan reflected on the three sharpers,
and said to himself, "These men have proved their skill in
whatever I have tried them. The lapidary was singularly excellent
in his art, the horse genealogist in his, and the last has proved
his upon my mistress. I have an inclination to know my own
descent beyond a doubt." He then ordered the genealogist into his
presence, and said, "Dost thou think thou canst prove my
descent?" "Yes, my lord," replied the man, "but on condition that
you spare my life after I shall have informed you; for the
proverb says, 'When the sultan is present, beware of his anger,
as there is no delay when he commands to strike.'" "There shall
be safety for thee," exclaimed the sultan, "in my promise, an
obligation that can never be forfeited."</p>

<p id="id04048">"O sultan," continued the genealogist, "when I shall inform thee
of thy parentage and descent, let not there be any present who
may hear me." "Wherefore?" replied the sultan. "My lord,"
answered the sharper, "you know the attributes of the Deity
should be veiled in mystery." The sultan now commanded all his
attendants to retire, and when they were alone, the genealogist
advanced and said, "Mighty prince, thou art illegitimate, and the
son of an adulteress."</p>

<p id="id04049">As soon as the sultan heard this, his colour changed, he turned
pale, and fainted away. When he was recovered, he remained some
time in deep contemplation, after which he exclaimed, "By him who
constituted me the guardian of his people, I swear that if thy
assertion be found true I will abdicate my kingdom, and resign it
to thee, for royalty cannot longer become me; but should thy
words prove void of foundation, I will put thee to instant
death." "To hear is to assent," replied the sharper.</p>

<p id="id04050">The sultan now arose, entered the haram, and bursting into his
mother's apartment with his cimeter drawn, exclaimed, "By him who
divided the heavens from the earth, shouldst thou not answer
faithfully to what I shall inquire, I will cut thee to pieces
with this cimeter." The queen, trembling with alarm, said, "What
dost thou ask of me?" "Inform me," replied the sultan, "of whom
am I the son?" "Since truth only can save me," cried the
princess, "know that thou art the offspring of a cook. My husband
had no children either male or female, on which account he became
sad, and lost his health and appetite. In a court of the haram we
had several sorts of birds, and one day the sultan fancying he
should relish one of them, ordered the cook to kill and dress it.
I happened then to be in the bath alone.</p>

<p id="id04051">"As I was in the bath," continued the sultana, "I saw the cook
endeavouring to catch the birds. At that instant it occurred to
my mind from the instigation of Satan, that if I bore not a son,
after the death of the sultan my influence would be lost. I
tempted the man, and thou art the produce of my crime. The signs
of my pregnancy soon appeared; and when the sultan was informed
of them, he recovered his health, and rejoiced exceedingly, and
conferred favours and presents on his ministers and courtiers
daily, till the time of my delivery. On that day he chanced to be
upon a hunting excursion at a country palace; but when
intelligence was brought him of the birth of a son, he instantly
returned to me, and issued orders for the city to be decorated,
which was done for forty days together, out of respect to the
sultan. Such was my crime, and such was thy birth."</p>

<p id="id04052">The sultan now returned to the adventurer, and commanded him to
pull off his clothes, which he did; when the sultan, disrobing
himself, habited him in the royal vestments, after which he said,
"Inform me whence thou judgest that I was a bastard?"</p>

<p id="id04053">"My lord," replied the adventurer, "when each of us shewed our
skill in what was demanded, you ordered him only an allowance of
a mess of pottage and three cakes of bread. Hence I judged you to
be the offspring of a cook, for it is the custom of princes to
reward the deserving with wealth and honours, but you only
gratified us with victuals from your kitchen." The sultan
replied, "Thou hast spoken truly." He then made him put on the
rest of the royal robes and ornaments, and seated him upon the
throne; after which he disguised himself in the habit of a
dervish, and wandered from his abdicated dominions. When the
lucky adventurer found himself in possession of the throne, he
sent for his companions; and finding they did not recognize him
in his royal habiliments, dismissed them with liberal presents,
but commanded them to quit his territories with the utmost
expedition, lest they should discover him. After this, with a
satisfied mind, he fulfilled the duties of his new station with a
liberality and dignity that made the inhabitants of the
metropolis and all the provinces bless him, and pray for the
prolongation of his reign.</p>

<p id="id04054" style="margin-top: 4em">             The Adventures of the Abdicated Sultan.</p>

<p id="id04055" style="margin-top: 3em">The abdicated prince, disguised as a dervish, did not cease
travelling in a solitary mood till he came to the city of Cairo,
which he perceived to be in repose and security, and well
regulated. Here he amused himself with walking through several
streets, till he had reached the royal palace, and was admiring
its magnificent architecture and extent, and the crowds passing
in and out, when the sultan with his train appeared in sight
returning from a hunting excursion, upon which he retired to one
side of the road. The sultan observing his dignified demeanour,
commanded one of his attendants to invite him to the palace, and
entertain him till he should inquire after him.</p>

<p id="id04056">When the sultan had reposed himself from the fatigue of his
exercise, he sent for the supposed dervish to his presence, and
said, "From what kingdom art thou arrived?" He answered, "I am,
my lord, a wandering dervish." "Well," replied the sultan, "but
inform me on what account thou art come here." On which he said,
"My lord, this cannot be done but in privacy." "Let it be so,"
rejoined the sultan; and rising up, led him into a retired
apartment of the palace. The supposed dervish then related what
had befallen him, the cause of his having abdicated his kingdom,
and taken upon himself the character of a religious. The sultan
was astonished at his self-denial, and exclaimed, "Blessed be his
holy name, who exalteth and humbleth whom he will by his almighty
power; but my history is more surprising than thine. I will
relate it to thee, and conceal nothing."</p>

<p id="id04057" style="margin-top: 4em">               History of Mahummud, Sultan of Cairo.</p>

<p id="id04058" style="margin-top: 3em">At my first outset in the world I was an indigent man, and
possessed none of the conveniences of life, till at length I
became possessed of ten pieces of silver, which I resolved to
expend in amusing myself. With this intention, I one day walked
into the principal market, intending first to purchase somewhat
delicate to feast upon. While I was looking about me, a man
passed by, with a great crowd following and laughing at him, for
he led in an iron chain a monstrous baboon, which he cried for
sale at the price of ten pieces of silver. Something
instinctively impelled me to purchase the creature, so I paid him
the money, and took my bargain to my lodging; but on my arrival,
was at a loss how to procure a meal for myself or the baboon.
While I was considering what I should do, the baboon having made
several springs, became suddenly transformed into a handsome
young man, beautiful as the moon at the fourteenth night of its
appearance, and addressed me, saying, "Shekh Mahummud, thou hast
purchased me for ten pieces of silver, being all thou hadst, and
art now thinking how thou canst procure food for me and thyself."
"That is true," replied I; "but in the name of Allah, from whence
dost thou come?" "Ask no questions," replied my companion, "but
take this piece of gold, and purchase us somewhat to eat and
drink." I took the gold, did as he had desired, and we spent the
evening merrily together in feasting and conversation, till it
was time to repose.</p>

<p id="id04059">In the morning the young man said, "My friend, this lodging is
not fitting for us; go, and hire a better." "To hear is to obey,"
replied I, and departed to the principal serai, where I hired an
upper apartment, to which we removed. He then gave me ten
deenars, with orders to purchase carpets and cushions, which I
did, and on my return found before him a package, containing
princely vestments. These he gave to me, desiring that I would go
to the bath, and, after bathing, put them on. I obeyed his
commands, dressed myself, and found in each pocket a hundred
deenars. I was not a little proud of my improved appearance in
the rich robes. On my return, he praised my figure, and seated me
by him, when we refreshed ourselves, and chatted on various
subjects. At length he gave me a bundle, desiring that I would
present it to the sultan, and at the same time demand his
daughter in marriage for myself, assuring me that my request
would meet a ready compliance.</p>

<p id="id04060">The young man commanded a slave he had bought to attend me, who
carried the bundle, and I set out for the palace; near which I
found a great crowd of grandees, officers, and guards, who seeing
me so richly habited, inquired respectfully what I wanted. Upon
my replying that my business was with the sultan, they informed
the ushers, who introduced me to the presence. I made the
customary obeisance, and the sultan returned my salute; after
which I presented the bundle before him, saying, "Will my lord
accept this trifle, becoming my humble situation to offer, but
certainly not worthy the royal dignity to receive?" The sultan
commanded the package to be opened; when, lo! it contained a
complete dress of royal apparel, richer than had ever been before
seen, at which the sultan was astonished, and exclaimed,
"Heavens! I have nothing like this, nor ever possessed so
magnificent a suit; it shall be accepted: but inform me, Shekh,
what thou requirest in return for so valuable an offering."
"Mighty sovereign," replied I, "my wish is to become thy relation
by espousing that precious gem of the casket of beauty, thy
incomparable daughter."</p>

<p id="id04061">When the sultan had heard this request, he turned towards his
vizier and said, "Advise me how I should act in this affair."
Upon which the minister replied, "Shew him, my lord, your most
valuable diamond, and inquire if he has any one equally precious
to match it as a marriage present for your daughter." The sultan
did so; when I said, "If I present two, will you give me your
daughter?" To which he assented, and I took my leave, carrying
with me the diamond, to shew the young man as a model. Upon my
arrival at our serai, I informed him of what passed, when he
examined the diamond, and said, "The day is now far spent, but
tomorrow I will procure ten like it, which thou shalt present to
the sultan." Accordingly in the morning he walked out, and in the
space of an hour returned with ten diamonds, which he gave me,
and I hastened with them to the sultan. When he beheld the
precious stones he was enraptured at their brilliancy, and again
consulted his vizier how he should act in this business. "My
lord," replied the minister, "you only required one diamond of
the Shekh, and he has presented you with ten: it is therefore
incumbent upon you to give him your daughter."</p>

<p id="id04062">The sultan now sent for the cauzees and effendis, who drew up the
deed of espousals, which they gave me, when I returned to our
serai, and shewed it to the young man, who said, "It is well; go
and complete thy marriage; but I entreat that thou wilt not
consummate thy nuptials till I shall give thee permission." "To
hear is to obey," replied I. When it was night I entered the
princess's apartment, but sat down at a distance from her, and
did not speak till morning, when I bade her farewell, and took my
leave for the day. I observed the same conduct the second night
and the third, upon which, offended at my coldness, she
complained to her mother, who informed the sultan of my
affronting behaviour.</p>

<p id="id04063">The sultan sent for me to his presence, and with much anger
threatened, if I should continue my coldness to the princess
another evening, that he would put me to death. Upon this I
hastened to inform my friend at the serai, who commanded, that
when I should next be alone with my wife I should demand of her a
bracelet which she wore upon her right arm, and bring it to him,
after which I might consummate my nuptials. I replied, "To hear
is to obey;" and the next evening, when I entered the apartment,
said to my wife, "If thou desirest that we should live happily
together, give me the bracelet on thy right arm." She did so
immediately, when I carried it to the young man, and, returning
to the palace, slept, as I supposed, with the princess till
morning. Guess, however, what was my surprise, when on awaking I
found myself lying in my first humble lodging, stripped of my
rich vestments, and saw on the ground my former mean attire;
namely, an old vest, a pair of tattered drawers, and a ragged
turban, as full of holes as a sieve. When I had somewhat
recovered my senses, I put them on and walked out in a melancholy
mood, regretting my lost happiness, and not knowing what I should
do to recover it. As I strolled towards the palace, I beheld
sitting in the street a fortune-teller, who had some written
papers before him, and was casting omens for the bystanders. I
advanced, and made him a salute, which he returned kindly; and
after looking attentively in my face, exclaimed, "What! has that
accursed wretch betrayed thee, and torn thee from thy wife?" I
replied, "Yes." Upon this he desired me to wait a little, and
seated me by him. When his employers were departed, he said, "My
friend, the ape which you purchased for ten pieces of silver, and
who soon after was transformed into a young man, is not of human
race, but a genie deeply in love with the princess whom you
married. However, he could not approach her while she wore the
bracelet, containing a powerful charm, upon her right arm, and
therefore made use of thee to obtain it. He is now with her, but
I will soon effect his destruction, that genii and men may be
secure from his wickedness, for he is one of the rebellious and
accursed spirits who disobeyed our lord Solomon, son of David."</p>

<p id="id04064">After this, the fortune-teller wrote a note, which having sealed
and directed, he gave it to me, saying, "Go to a certain spot,
wait there, and observe those who may approach. Fortify thy mind,
and when thou shall see a great personage attended by a numerous
train, present to him this letter, when he will accomplish thy
desires." I took the note, immediately departed for the place to
which the fortune-teller had directed me, and after travelling
all night and half the next day reached it, and sat down to wait
for what might happen. The evening shut in, and about a fourth
part of the night had passed, when a great glare of lights
appeared advancing towards me from a distance; and as it shone
nearer, I perceived persons carrying flambeaux and lanterns, also
a numerous train of attendants, as if belonging to some mighty
sultan. My mind was alarmed, but I recovered myself, and resolved
to stay where I was. A great concourse passed by me, marching two
and two, and at length there appeared a sultan of the genii,
surrounded by a splendid attendance; upon which I advanced as
boldly as I could, and having prostrated myself, presented the
letter, which he opened, and read aloud, as follows:</p>

<p id="id04065">"Be it known unto thee, O sultan of the genii, that the bearer of
this is in distress, from which thou must relieve him by
destroying his enemy. Shouldst thou not assist him, beware of thy
own safety. Farewell."</p>

<p id="id04066">When the sultan of the genii had read the note, he called out to
one of his messengers, who immediately attended before him, and
commanded him to bring into his presence without delay the genie
who had enchanted the daughter of the sultan of Cairo. "To hear
is to obey," replied the messenger, and instantly disappearing,
was absent for about an hour, when he returned with the criminal,
and placed him before the sultan of the genii, who exclaimed,
"Accursed wretch, hast thou ill-treated this man?"</p>

<p id="id04067">"Mighty sovereign," replied the genie, "my crime proceeded from
love of the princess, who wore a charm in her bracelet which
prevented my approaching her, and therefore I made use of this
man. He procured me the charm, and I now have her in my power;
but I love her tenderly, and have not injured her." "Return the
bracelet instantly," replied the sultan of the genii, "that the
man may recover his wife, or I will command an executioner to
strike off thy head." The offending genie, who was of an accursed
and obstinate race, upon hearing these words was inflamed with
passion, and insolently cried out, "I will not return the
bracelet, for no one shall possess the princess but myself."
Having said thus, he attempted to fly away, but in vain.</p>

<p id="id04068">The sultan of the genii now commanded his attendants to bind the
criminal in chains, which they did, and having forced the
bracelet from him, struck off his head. The sultan then presented
me the charm, which was no sooner in my hand than all the genii
vanished from my sight, and I found myself dressed as before, in
the rich habit given me by the pretended young man. I proceeded
to the city, which I entered, and when I came near the palace was
recognized by the guards and courtiers, who cried out in raptures
of joy, "Our lost prince is at length returned." They paid their
respects, and I entered the apartment of the princess, whom I
found in a deep sleep, in which state she had been ever since my
departure. On my replacing the bracelet on her arm, she awoke.
After this we lived together in all happiness till the death of
her father, who appointed me his successor, having no son, so
that I am what I am.</p>

<p id="id04069">When the sultan of Cairo had finished his narrative, the
abdicated prince expressed his surprise at his adventures: upon
which the sultan said, "Wonder not, my brother, at the
dispensations of the Almighty, for he worketh in secret, and when
he pleaseth revealeth his mysteries. Since thou hast quitted thy
kingdom, if thou choosest, thou shalt be my vizier, and we will
live together as friends and brothers." "To hear is to obey,"
replied the prince. The sultan then constituted him vizier,
enrobed him in a rich uniform, and committed to him his seal, the
inkstand, and other insignia of office, at the same time
conferring upon him a magnificent palace, superbly furnished with
gorgeous carpets, musnuds, and cushions: belonging to it were
also extensive gardens. The vizier entered immediately upon his
new office; held his divans regularly twice every day, and judged
so equitably on all appeals brought before him, that his fame for
justice and impartiality was soon spread abroad; insomuch, that
whoever had a cause or dispute willingly referred it to his
decision, and was satisfied with it, praying for his life and
prosperity. In this state he remained for many years, the
sovereign pleased with him, and he happy under the protection of
the sultan of Cairo, so that he did not regret his abdicated
kingdom.</p>

<p id="id04070">It happened one evening that the mind of the sultan was
depressed, upon which he sent for the vizier, who attended; when
he said, "Vizier, my mind is so uneasy that nothing will amuse
me." "Enter then," replied the minister, "into thy cabinet, and
look at thy jewels, the examination of which may perhaps
entertain thee." The sultan did so, but it had no effect on his
lassitude; when he said, "Vizier, this dispiritedness will not
quit me, and nothing gives me pleasure within my palace; let us,
therefore, walk out in disguise." "To hear is to obey," replied
the vizier. They then retired into a private chamber, and putting
on the habits of dervishes of Arabia, strolled through the city
till they reached a hospital for lunatics, which they entered.
Here they beheld two men, one reading and the other listening to
him; when the sultan said to himself, "This is surprising;" and
addressed the men, saying, "Are you really mad?" They replied,
"We are not mad, but our stories are so wonderful, that were they
recorded on a tablet of adamant, they would remain for examples
to them who would be advised." "Let us hear them," said the
sultan; upon which, the man who had been reading exclaimed, "Hear
mine first!" and thus began.</p>

<p id="id04071" style="margin-top: 4em">                    Story of the First Lunatic.</p>

<p id="id04072" style="margin-top: 3em">I was a merchant, and had a warehouse in which were Indian goods
of all sorts, and of the highest value, and I bought and sold to
great advantage. One day as I was sitting in my warehouse,
according to custom, busy in buying and selling, an old woman
came in, telling her beads, and greeted me. I returned her
salute, when she sat down, and said, "Sir, have you any choice
Indian cloths?" "Yes, my mistress," replied I, "of all sorts that
you can possibly wish for." "Bring them," said she. I showed her
a piece of great value, with which she was highly pleased, and
inquired the price. "Five hundred deenars," replied I: she took
out her purse, paid me the money, and went away with the cloth;
upon which I had a profit of one hundred and fifty deenars. She
returned the next day, bought another piece, paid for it, and, in
short, did the same for fifteen days successively, paying me
regularly for each purchase. On the sixteenth day she came to my
shop as usual, chose the cloth and was going to pay me, but
missed her purse; upon which she said, "Sir, I have unfortunately
left my purse at home." "Mistress," replied I, "it is of no
consequence; take the cloth, and if you return, well, if not, you
are welcome to this trifle:" she would not take it: I pressed
her, but in vain. Much friendly argument passed between us, till
at length she said, "Sir, you contradict, and I contradict, but
we shall never agree unless you will favour me by accompanying me
to my house to receive the value of your goods; so lock up your
warehouse, lest any thing should be lost in your absence."
Accordingly I fastened my doors, and accompanied her; we walked
on conversing, till we came near her house, when she pulled out a
handkerchief from her girdle, and said, "My desire is to tie this
over thy eyes." "On what account?" replied I. "Because," said
she, "in our way are several houses, the gates of which are open,
and the women sitting in their balconies, so that possibly thy
eyes may glance upon some one of them, and thy heart be
distracted with love; for in this part are many beautiful
damsels, who would fascinate even a religious, and therefore I am
alarmed for thy peace."</p>

<p id="id04073">Upon this I said to myself, "This old woman advises me properly,"
and I consented to her demand; when she bound the handkerchief
over my eyes, and we proceeded till we arrived at her house. She
knocked at the door, which was opened by a damsel, and we
entered. The old lady then took the handkerchief from my eyes,
when I looked around me, and perceived that I was in a mansion
having several quadrangles, highly ornamented, and resembling the
palaces of the sultan.</p>

<p id="id04074">The old lady now desired me to retire into a room, which I did,
and there beheld heaped together all the pieces of cloth which
she had purchased of me, at which I was surprised, but still more
so when two damsels beautiful as resplendent moons approached,
and having divided a piece of cloth into halves, each took one,
and wrapped it round her hand. They then sprinkled the floor with
rose water and other scents, wiping it with the cloth, and
rubbing it till it became bright as silver; after which they
withdrew into an adjoining room, and brought out at least fifty
stools, which they set down, and placed over each a rich
covering, with cushions of tissue. They then fetched a large
stool of gold, and having put upon it a carpet and cushions of
gold brocade, retired. Not long after this, there descended from
the staircase by two and two, as many damsels in number as the
stools; upon each of which one sat down. At last descended a lady
attended by ten damsels, who placed herself upon the larger
stool. When I beheld her, my lord, my senses forsook me, and I
was in raptures at her beauty, her stature, and elegance, as she
chatted and laughed with her companions.</p>

<p id="id04075">At length she exclaimed, "My dear mother!" when the old woman
entered; to whom she said, "Hast thou brought the young man?" She
replied, "Yes, my daughter, he is ready to attend thee." Upon
which the lady said, "Introduce him to me." When I heard this I
was alarmed, and said to myself, "There is no refuge but in the
most high God; doubtless she has discovered my being here, and
will command me to be put to death." The old woman came to me,
and leading me by the hand, took me before the lady seated on the
golden stool, who, on seeing me, smiled, made a graceful salute,
and waved her hand for a seat to be brought, which was done, and
placed close to her own. She then commanded me to sit down, which
I did with much confusion.</p>

<p id="id04076">When I was seated, the lady began to chat and joke with me,
saying, "What think you of my appearance and my beauty, do you
judge me worthy of your affection? shall I be your partner and
you mine?" When I had heard these words, I replied, "How, dear
lady, dare I presume, who am not worthy to be your servant, to
arrive at such an honour?" Upon this, she said, "Young man, my
words have no evasion in them; be not discouraged, or fearful of
returning me an answer, for my heart is devoted to thy love." I
now perceived, my lord, that the lady was anxious to marry me;
but could not conceive on what account, or who could have given
her intelligence concerning me. She continued to shew me so many
pleasing attentions, that at length I was emboldened to say,
"Lady, if your words to me are sincere, according to the proverb,
no time is so favourable as the present." "There cannot," said
she, "be a more fortunate day than this for our union." Upon this
I replied, "My dear lady, how can I allot for you a proper
dowry?" "The value of the cloth you intrusted to the old lady,
who is my mother," answered she, "is sufficient." "That cannot be
enough," rejoined I. "Nothing more shall be added," exclaimed the
lady; "and my intention is this instant to send for the cauzee
and witnesses, and I will choose a trustee, that they may unite
us without delay. We will celebrate our nuptials this very
evening, but upon one condition." "What is that?" replied I. She
answered, "That you bind yourself not to address or hold
conversation with any woman but myself." My lord, I was eager to
be in possession of so beautiful a woman, and therefore said to
her, "I agree, and will never contradict thee either by my words
or actions." She then sent for the cauzee and witnesses, and
appointed a trustee, after which we were married. After the
ceremony, she ordered coffee and sherbet, gave money to the
cauzee, a dress of honour to her trustee, and they departed.</p>

<p id="id04077">I was lost in astonishment, and said to myself, "Do I dream, or
am I awake?" She now commanded her damsels to empty the warm
bath, fill it afresh, and prepare cloths and necessaries for
bathing. When they had done as she desired, she ordered the
eunuchs in waiting to conduct me to the hummaum, and gave them a
rich dress. They led me into an elegant apartment, difficult for
speech to describe. They spread many-coloured carpets, upon which
I sat down and undressed; after which I entered the hummaum, and
perceived delightful odours from sandal wood, of comorin, and
other sweets diffusing from every part. Here they seated me,
covered me with perfumed soaps, and rubbed me till my body became
bright as silver; when they brought the basins, and I washed with
warm water, after which they gave me rose-water, and I poured it
over me. They next brought in sweet-smelling salves, which I
rubbed over me, and then repaired to the hummaum, where I found a
royal dress, in which the eunuchs arrayed me; and after perfuming
me with incense of sandal wood, brought in confections, coffee,
and sherberts of various sorts, with which I refreshed myself. I
then left the bath with my attendants, who shewed me into the
grand hall of the palace, which was spread with most magnificent
carpets, stools, and cushions. Here the lady met me, attired in a
new habit, more sumptuous than I had seen her in before.</p>

<p id="id04078">When I beheld my bride, she appeared to me, from the richness of
her ornaments, like a concealed treasure from which the talisman
had just been removed. She sat down by me, and smiled so
fascinatingly upon me, I could no longer contain my rapture. In a
short time she retired, but soon returned again in a dress richer
than her last. I again embraced her, and in short, my lord, we
remained together for ten days in the height of happiness and
enjoyment. At the end of this period I recollected my mother, and
said to my wife, "It is so long since I have been absent from
home, and since my mother has not seen me, that I am certain she
must be anxious concerning me. Will you permit me to visit her
and look after my warehouse?" "There can be no impediment,"
replied she; "you may visit your mother daily, and employ
yourself in your warehouse, but the old woman must conduct you
and bring you back;" to which I assented.</p>

<p id="id04079">The old lady then came in, tied a handkerchief over my eyes,
conducted me to the spot where she had first blindfolded me, and
said, "You will return here about the time of evening prayer, and
will find me waiting." I left her, and repaired to my mother,
whom I found in great affliction at my absence, and weeping
bitterly. Upon seeing me, she ran and embraced me with tears of
joy. I said, "Weep not, my dear mother, for my absence has been
owing to the highest good fortune." I then informed her of my
lucky adventure, when she exclaimed, "May Allah protect thee, my
son, but visit me at least every two days, that my affection for
thee may be gratified." I then went to my warehouse, and employed
myself as usual till evening, when I returned to the place
appointed, where I found the old lady, who blindfolded me as
before, and conducted me to the palace of my wife, who received
me with fondness. For three months I continued to go and come in
this manner, but I could not help wishing to know whom I had
married, and wondering at the affluence, splendour, and
attendance that appeared around her.</p>

<p id="id04080">At length I found an opportunity of being in private with one of
her black slaves, and questioned her concerning her mistress. "My
lord," replied she, "the history of my mistress is wonderful; but
I dare not relate it, lest she should put me to death." Upon
this, I assured her, that if she would inform me, no one should
know it but myself, and I took an oath of secrecy, when she began
as follows:</p>

<p id="id04081">"My mistress one day went to a public bath, intending to amuse
herself, for which purpose she made such preparations of
delicacies and rarities, as were worth a camel's load of
treasure, and when she left the hummaum, made an excursion to a
garden, where a splendid collation was laid out. Here she
continued enjoying herself till evening, when she ordered her
retinue to make ready for departure, and the fragments of the
entertainment to be distributed among the poor. On her return,
she passed through the street in which is your warehouse. It was
upon a Friday, when you were sitting in conversation with a
friend, arrayed in your best attire. She beheld you, her heart
was stricken with love, but no one perceived her emotion.
However, she had no sooner reached her palace than she became low
and melancholy, and her appetite failed her. At length she took
to her bed, her colour left her, sleep forsook her, and she
became very weak. Upon this her mother went to call in a
physician, that he might consider what might be the cause of her
daughter's indisposition; but on the way she met a skilful old
lady, with whom she returned home.</p>

<p id="id04082">"The old lady on feeling the pulse of her patient, and after
asking several questions, could perceive in her no bodily ailment
or pain; upon which she judged she was in love, but did not
venture to speak to her before her mother of her suspicions. She
took leave, and said, 'By God's blessing thou wilt soon recover;
I will return tomorrow, and bring with me an infallible
medicine.' She then took her mother aside, and said, 'My good
lady, be not angry at what I shall remark, but thy daughter has
no bodily disorder; she is in love, and there can be no cure for
her but by a union with her beloved.' The mother, on the
departure of the old lady, repaired to her daughter, and with
much difficulty, after twenty days of denial (for my mistress's
modesty was hurt), obtained from her a description of your
person, and the street in which you lived; upon which she behaved
to you in the manner you are well acquainted with, brought you
here, and you know what followed. Such is her history," concluded
the black slave, "which you must not reveal." "I will not,"
replied I; and after this I continued to live very happily with
my wife, going daily to see my mother, to attend in my warehouse,
and return in the evening, conducted as usual by the old lady my
mother-in-law.</p>

<p id="id04083">One day, after the expiration of some months, as I was sitting in
my warehouse, a damsel came into the street with the image of a
cock, composed of jewelry. It was set with pearls, diamonds, and
other precious stones, and she offered it to the merchants for
sale; when they began bidding for it at five hundred deenars, and
went to nine hundred and fifty; all which I observed in silence
and did not interfere by speaking or bidding. At length the
damsel came up to me, and said, "My lord, all the merchants have
increased in bidding for my precious toy, but you have neither
bidden, nor taken any notice of me." "I have no occasion for it,"
replied I. "Nay," exclaimed she, "but you must bid something
more." "Since I must," I answered, "I will give fifty deenars
more, which will be just a thousand." She accepted the price, and
I went into my warehouse to fetch the money to pay her, saying to
myself, "I will present this curiosity to my wife, as it may
please her." When I was going to pay the money, the damsel would
not take it, but said, "My lord, I have a request to make, which
is, that I may snatch one kiss from your cheek as the price of my
jewelry, for I want nothing else." Upon this, I thought to
myself, a single kiss of my cheek is an easy price for the value
of a thousand deenars, and consented; when she came up to me and
gave me a kiss, but at the same time a most severe bite; left the
piece of jewelry, and went away with the greatest haste.</p>

<p id="id04084">In the evening I repaired to the house of my wife, and found the
old lady waiting as usual at the accustomed spot. She tied the
handkerchief over my eyes, and when she had conducted me home,
took it off. I found my wife sitting upon her golden stool, but
dressed in scarlet, and with an angry countenance; upon which I
said to myself, "God grant all may be well." I approached her,
took out the toy set with diamonds and rubies (thinking that on
sight of it her ill-humour would vanish), and said, "My mistress,
accept this, for it is curious, and I purchased it for thee." She
took it into her hand, and examined it on all sides; after which
she exclaimed, "Didst thou really purchase this on my account?"
"By heavens," replied I, "I bought it for thy sake, for a
thousand deenars." Upon this she frowned angrily upon me, and
exclaimed, "What means that wound upon thy cheek?" I was
overwhelmed with confusion.</p>

<p id="id04085">While I was in this state, she called out to her attendants, who
immediately descended the staircase, carrying the headless corpse
of a young girl, the head placed upon the middle of the body. I
looked, and knew it to be the head of the damsel who had sold me
the piece of jewelry for a kiss, and had bitten my cheek. My wife
now exclaimed, "I had no occasion for such baubles, for I have
many of them; but I wished to know if thou wert so faithful to
thy agreement with me, as not to address another woman than
myself, and sent the girl to try thee. Since thy promise has been
broken, begone, and return no more."</p>

<p id="id04086">When my wife had finished her speech, the old woman took me by
the hand, tied the handkerchief over my eyes, and conducted me to
the usual spot, when she said, "Begone!" and disappeared. I was
so overcome by the sad adventure, and the loss of my wife, that I
ran through the streets like one frantic, crying, "Ah, what
beauty, what grace, what elegance did she possess!" upon which,
the people, supposing me distracted, conducted me to this
hospital, and bound me in fetters, as you see.</p>

<p id="id04087">When the sultan had heard the young man's story, he was much
affected, inclined his head for some instants in deep thought,
then said to his vizier, "By Allah, who has intrusted me with
sovereignty, if thou dost not discover the lady who married this
young man, thy head shall be forfeited." The vizier was alarmed,
but recovering himself, replied, "Allow me three days to search,"
to which the sultan consented. The vizier then took with him the
young man, and for two days was at a loss how to find out the
house. At length he inquired if he should know the spot where the
handkerchief was tied over his eyes, and the gateway at which it
was taken off, of both which the youth professed to be certain.
He conducted the minister to the street where he was blindfolded,
and they reached a gateway, at which the vizier knocked. It was
opened by the domestics, who knowing the vizier, and seeing the
young man with him, were alarmed, and ran to communicate the
quality of the visitants to their mistress. She desired to know
the commands of the vizier, who informed her, that it was the
sultan's pleasure she should be reconciled to her husband; to
which she replied, "Since the sultan hath commanded, my duty is
obedience." The young man was reunited to his wife, who was the
daughter of a former sultan of Cairo.</p>

<p id="id04088">Such were the adventures of the young man who was reading in the
hospital. We now recite those of the youth who was listening to
him. Upon the sultan's inquiring his story, he began as follows.</p>

<p id="id04089" style="margin-top: 4em">                     Story of the Second Lunatic.</p>

<p id="id04090" style="margin-top: 3em">My lord, I was by profession a merchant, and on my commencing
business the youngest of my trade, having but just entered my
sixteenth year. As I was one day busy in my warehouse, a damsel
entering, put into my hands a packet, which, on opening, I found
to contain several copies of verses in praise of myself, with a
letter expressive of ardent affection for my person. Supposing
them meant only as banter, I foolishly flew into a passion,
seized the bearer, and beat her severely. On her departure, I
reflected on my improper behaviour, dreaded lest she should
complain to her relations, and that they might revenge themselves
upon me by some sudden assault. I repented of what I had done,
but alas! it was when repentance would not avail.</p>

<p id="id04091">Ten days had passed, when, as I was sitting in my warehouse as
usual, a young lady entered most superbly dressed, and
odoriferously perfumed. She resembled in brightness the moon on
its fourteenth night, so that when I gazed upon her my senses
forsook me, and I was incapable of attention to any thing but
herself. She addressed me, saying, "Young man, have you in your
warehouse any female ornaments?" to which I replied, "Of all
sorts, my lady, that you can possibly require." Upon this she
desired to see some bracelets for the ankles, which I shewed her,
when holding out her foot, she desired me to try them on. I did
so. After this, she asked for a necklace, and opening her veil,
made me tie it on. She then chose a pair of bracelets, and
extending her hands, desired me to put them on her wrists, which
I did; after which, she inquired the amount of the whole, when I
exclaimed, "Fair lady, accept them as a present, and inform me
whose daughter thou art." She replied, "I am the daughter of the
chief magistrate;" when I said, "My wish is to demand thee in
marriage of thy father." She consented that I should, but
observed, "When you ask me of my father, he will say, I have only
one daughter, who is a cripple, and wretchedly deformed. Do thou,
however, reply, that thou art willing to accept her, and if he
remonstrates, still insist upon wedding her." I then asked when I
should make my proposals. She replied, "The best time to visit my
father is on the Eed al Koorbaun, which is three days hence, as
thou wilt then find with him all his relations and friends, and
our espousals will add to his festivity."</p>

<p id="id04092">Agreeably to the lady's instructions, on the third day following
I repaired with several of my friends to the house of the chief
magistrate, and found him sitting in state, receiving the
compliments of the day from the chief inhabitants of the city. We
made our obeisance, which he graciously noticed, received us with
kindness, and entered familiarly into conversation. A collation
was brought in, the cloth spread, and we partook with him of the
viands, after which we drank coffee. I then stood up, saying, "My
lord, I am desirous of espousing the chaste lady your daughter,
more precious than the richest gem."</p>

<p id="id04093">When the chief magistrate heard my speech, he inclined his head
for some time towards the earth in deep thought, after which he
said, "Son, my daughter is an unfortunate cripple, miserably
deformed." To this I replied, "To have her for my wife is all I
wish." The magistrate then said, "If thou wilt have a wife of
this description, it must be on condition that she shall not be
taken from my house, that thou shalt consummate the marriage
here, and abide with me." I replied, "To hear is to obey;"
believing that she was the beautiful damsel who had visited my
warehouse, and whose charms I had so rapturously beheld. In
short, the nuptial ceremony was performed, when I said to myself,
"Heavens! is it possible that I am become master of this
beautiful damsel, and shall possess her charms!"</p>

<p id="id04094">When night set in, the domestics of the chief magistrate
introduced me into the chamber of my bride. I ran eagerly to gaze
upon her beauty, but guess my mortification when I beheld her a
wretched dwarf, a cripple, and deformed, as her father had
represented. I was overcome with horror at the sight of her,
distracted with disappointment, and ashamed of my own foolish
credulity, but I dared not complain, as I had voluntarily
accepted her as my wife from the magistrate: I sat down silently
in one corner of the chamber, and she in another, for I could not
bring myself to approach her, as she was disgusting to the sight
of man, and my soul could not endure her company.</p>

<p id="id04095">At day-break I left the house of my father-in-law, repaired to my
warehouse, which I opened, and sat down much distressed in mind, with
my head dizzy, like one suffering from intoxication, when lo! who
should appear before me but the lady who had put upon me so mortifying
a trick. She entered, and paid me the customary salute. I was enraged,
and began to abuse her, saying, "Wherefore hast thou put upon me such
a stratagem?" when she replied, "Wretch, recollect the day that I
brought thee a packet, in return for which you seized, beat, reviled,
and drove me scornfully away. In retaliation for such treatment, I
have taken revenge by giving thee such a delectable bride." I now fell
at her feet, entreated her forgiveness, and expressed my repentance;
upon which, smiling upon me, she said, "Be not uneasy, for as I have
plunged thee into a dilemma, I will also relieve thee from it. Go to
the aga of the leather-dressers, give him a sum of money, and desire
him to call thee his son; then repair with him, attended by his
followers and musicians, to the house of the chief magistrate. When he
inquires the cause of their coming, let the aga say, 'My lord, we are
come to congratulate thy son-in-law, who is my beloved child, on his
marriage with thy daughter, and to rejoice with him.' The magistrate
will be furiously enraged, and exclaim, 'Dog, is it possible that,
being a leather-dresser, thou durst marry the daughter of the chief
magistrate?' Do thou then reply, 'My lord, my ambition was to be
ennobled by your alliance, and as I have married your lordship's
daughter, the mean appellation of leather-dresser will soon be
forgotten and lost in the glorious title of the son-in-law of your
lordship; I shall be promoted under your protection, and purified from
the odour of the tan-pit, so that my offspring will smell as sweet as
that of a syed."</p>

<p id="id04096">I did as the lady had directed me, and having bribed the chief of
the leather-dressers, he accompanied me with the body of his
trade, and a numerous party of musicians, vocal and instrumental,
to my father-in-law's house, before which they began to sing and
dance with great clamour every now and then crying out, "Long
live our noble kinsman! Long live the son-in-law of the chief
magistrate!" The magistrate inquired into the cause of our
intrusive rejoicing, when I told him my kinsfolk were
congratulating me upon my alliance with his illustrious house,
and come to thank him for the honour he had done the whole body
of leather-dressers in my person. The chief magistrate on hearing
this was passionately enraged, and abused me; but reflecting that
without my consent the supposed disgrace of his noble house could
not be done away, he became calm, and offered me money to divorce
his daughter. At first I pretended unwillingness, but at length
affecting to be moved by his earnest entreaties, accepted forty
purses of gold, which he gave me to repudiate my deformed wife,
and I returned home with a lightened heart. The day following,
the lady came to my warehouse, when I thanked her for having
freed me from my ridiculous marriage, and begged her to accept of
me as a husband. To this she consented, but said she was, she
feared, too meanly born for me to marry, as her father was but a
cook, though of eminence in his way, and very rich. I replied,
"Even though he were a leather-dresser, thy charms would grace a
throne." In short, my lord, we were married, and have lived
together very happily from the day of our union to the present
time.</p>

<p id="id04097">Such is my story, but it is not so surprising as that of the
learned man and his pupil, whose adventures were among the
miracles of the age, which I will relate.</p>

<p id="id04098" style="margin-top: 4em; margin-right: 1%; margin-left: 1%"> Story of the retired Sage and his Pupil, related to the Sultan
                     by the Second Lunatic,</p>

<p id="id04099" style="margin-top: 3em">There was a learned and devout sage, who in order to enjoy his
studies and contemplations uninterrupted, had secluded himself
from the world in one of the cells of the principal mosque of the
city, which he never left but upon the most pressing occasions.
He had led this retired life some years, when a boy one day
entered his cell, and earnestly begged to be received as his
pupil and domestic. The sage liked his appearance, consented to
his request, inquired who were his parents, and whence he came;
but the lad could not inform him, and said, "Ask not who I am,
for I am an orphan, and know not whether I belong to heaven or
earth." The shekh did not press him, and the boy served him with
the most undeviating punctuality and attention for twelve years,
during which he received his instructions in every branch of
learning, and became a most accomplished youth. At the end of the
twelve years, the youth one day heard some young men praising the
beauty of the sultan's daughter, and saying that her charms were
unequalled by those of all the princesses of the age. This
discourse excited his curiosity to behold so lovely a creature.
He repaired to his master, saying, "My lord, I understand that
the sultan hath a most beautiful daughter, and my soul longs
ardently for an opportunity of beholding her, if only for an
instant." The sage exclaimed, "What have such as we to do, my
son, with the daughters of sovereigns or of others? We are a
secluded order, and should refrain ourselves from associating
with the great ones of this world." The old man continued to warn
his pupil against the vanities of the age, and to divert him from
his purpose; but the more he advised and remonstrated, the more
intent the youth became on his object, which affected his mind so
much, that he grew very uneasy, and was continually weeping.</p>

<p id="id04100">The sage observing his distress was afflicted at it, and at
length said to the youth, "Will one look at the princess satisfy
thy wishes?" "It shall," replied the pupil. The sage then
anointed one of his eyes with a sort of ointment; when lo! he
became to appearance as a man divided into half, and the sage
ordered him to go and hop about the city. The youth obeyed his
commands, but he had no sooner got into the street than he was
surrounded by a crowd of passengers, who gazed with astonishment
at his appearance. The report of so strange a phenomenon as a
half man soon spread throughout the city, and reached the palace
of the sultan, who sent for the supposed monster to the presence.
The youth was conveyed to the palace, where the whole court gazed
upon him with wonder; after which he was taken into the haram, to
gratify the curiosity of the women. He beheld the princess, and
was fascinated by the brilliancy of her charms, insomuch, that he
said to himself, "If I cannot wed her, I will put myself to
death."</p>

<p id="id04101">The youth being at length dismissed from the palace, returned
home; his heart tortured with love for the daughter of the
sultan. On his arrival, the sage inquired if he had seen the
princess. "I have," replied the youth, "but one look is not
enough, and I cannot rest until I shall sit beside her, and feast
my eyes till they are wearied with gazing upon her." "Alas! my
son," exclaimed the old man, "I fear for thy safety: we are
religious men, and should avoid temptations; nor does it become
us to have any thing to do with the sultan." To this the youth
replied, "My lord, unless I shall sit beside her, and touch her
neck with my hands, I shall, through despair, put myself to
death."</p>

<p id="id04102">At these words, the sage was alarmed for the safety of his pupil,
and said to himself, "I will, if possible, preserve this amiable
youth, and perchance Allah may gratify his wishes." He then
anointed both his eyes with an ointment, which had the effect of
rendering him invisible to human sight. After this, he said, "Go,
my son, and gratify thy wishes, but return again, and be not too
long absent from thy duty."</p>

<p id="id04103">The youth hastened towards the royal palace, which he entered
unperceived, and proceeded into the haram, where he seated
himself near the daughter of the sultan. For some time he
contented himself with gazing on her beauty, but at length
extending his hands, touched her softly on the neck. As soon as
she felt his touch, the princess, alarmed, shrieked out
violently, and exclaimed, "I seek refuge with Allah, from Satan
the accursed." Her mother and the ladies present, affrighted at
her outcries, eagerly inquired the cause; when she said, "Eblees,
or some other evil spirit, hath this instant touched me on the
neck."</p>

<p id="id04104">Upon this, the mother was alarmed and sent for her nurse, who,
when informed of what had happened, declared, "That nothing was
so specific to drive away evil spirits as the smoke of camel's
hair;" a quantity of which was instantly brought, and being set
fire to, the smoke of it filled the whole apartment, and so
affected the eyes of the young man, that they watered
exceedingly, when he unthinkingly wiped them with his
handkerchief, so that with his tears the ointment was soon washed
off.</p>

<p id="id04105">The ointment was no sooner wiped away from his eyes than the
young man became visible, and the princess, her mother, and the
ladies, all at once uttered a general cry of astonishment and
alarm; upon which the eunuchs rushed into the apartment. Seeing
the youth, they surrounded him, beat him unmercifully, then bound
him with cords, and dragged him before the sultan, whom they
informed of his having been found in the royal haram. The sultan,
enraged, sent for an executioner, and commanded him to seize the
culprit, to clothe him in a black habit patched over with flame
colour, to mount him upon a camel, and after parading with him
through the streets of the city, to put him to death.</p>

<p id="id04106">The executioner took the young man, dressed him as he had been
directed, placed him upon the camel, and led him through the
city, preceded by guards and a crier, who bawled out, "Behold the
merited punishment of him who has dared to violate the sanctuary
of the royal haram." The procession was followed by an
incalculable crowd of people, who were astonished at the beauty
of the young man, and the little concern he seemed to feel at his
own situation.</p>

<p id="id04107">At length the procession arrived in the square before the great
mosque, when the sage, disturbed by the noise and concourse of
the people, looked from the window of his cell, and beheld the
disgraceful situation of his pupil. He was moved to pity, and
instantly calling upon the genii (for by his knowledge of magic
and every abstruse science he had them all under his control),
commanded them to bring him the youth from the camel, and place
in his room, without being perceived, some superannuated man.
They did so, and when the multitude saw the youth, as it were,
transformed into a well-known venerable shekh, they were stricken
with awe, and said, "Heavens! the young man turns out to be our
reverend chief of the herb-sellers;" for the old man had long
been accustomed to dispose of greens and sugarcane at the college
gate near the great mosque, and was the oldest in his trade.</p>

<p id="id04108">The executioner, on beholding the change of appearance in his
prisoner, was confounded. He returned to the palace with the old
man upon the camel, and followed by the crowd. He hastened or
contrive my death to the sultan, and said, "My lord, the young
man is vanished, and in his room became seated upon the camel
this venerable shekh, well known to the whole city." On hearing
this, the sultan was alarmed, and said to himself, "Whoever has
been able to perform this, can do things much more surprising He
may depose me from my kingdom."</p>

<p id="id04109">The sultan's fears increased so much, that he was at a loss how
to act. He summoned his vizier, and said, "Advise me what to do
in the affair of this strange youth, for I am utterly
confounded." The vizier for some time inclined his head towards
the ground in profound thought, then addressing the sultan, said,
"My lord, no one could have done this but by the help of genii,
or by a power which we cannot comprehend, and he may possibly, if
irritated, do you in future a greater injury respecting your
daughter. I advise, therefore, that you cause it to be proclaimed
throughout the city, that whoever has done this, if he will
appear before you shall have pardon on the word of a sultan,
which can never be broken. Should he then surrender himself,
espouse him to your daughter, when perhaps his mind may be
reconciled by her love. He has already beheld her, and seen the
ladies of the haram, so that nothing can save your honour but his
union with the princess."</p>

<p id="id04110">The sultan approved the advice of his vizier, the proclamation was
issued, and the crier proceeded through several streets, till at
length he reached the square of the great mosque. The pupil
hearing the proclamation, was enraptured, and running to his
patron, declared his intention of surrendering himself to the
sultan. "My son," said the sage, "why shouldst thou do so? Hast
thou not already suffered sufficiently?" The youth replied,
"Nothing shall prevent me." Upon which the sage exclaimed, "Go
then, my son, and my midnight prayers shall attend thee."</p>

<p id="id04111">The youth now repaired to the hummaum, and having bathed, dressed
himself in his richest habit; after which he discovered himself
to the crier, who conducted him to the palace. He made a profound
obeisance to the sultan, at the same time uttering an eloquent
prayer for his long life and prosperity. The sultan was struck
with his manly beauty, the gracefulness of his demeanour, and the
propriety of his delivery, and said, "Young stranger, who art
thou, and from whence dost thou come?" "I am," replied the youth,
"the half man whom you saw, and have done what you are already
acquainted with."</p>

<p id="id04112">The sultan now requested him to sit in the most honourable place,
and entered into conversation on various subjects. He put to him
several difficult questions in science, to which the youth
replied with such judgment, that his abilities astonished him,
and he said to himself, "This young man is truly worthy of my
daughter." He then addressed him, saying, "Young man, my wish is
to unite thee to my daughter, for thou hast already seen her,
also her mother, and after what has passed no one will marry
her." The youth replied, "I am ready in obedience, but must
advise with my friends." "Go then," said the sultan, "consult
with thy friends, and return quickly."</p>

<p id="id04113">The young man repaired to the sage, and having informed him of
what had passed between himself and the sultan, signified his
wish to marry the princess, when the shekh replied, "Do so, my
son; there can be in the measure no crime, as it is a lawful
alliance." "But I wish," said the youth, "to invite the sultan to
visit you." "By all means," answered the sage. "My lord,"
rejoined the pupil, "since I first came, and you honoured me in
your service, I have beheld you in no other residence but this
confined cell, from which you have never stirred night or day.
How can I invite the sultan here?" "My son," exclaimed the shekh,
"go to the sultan, rely upon Allah, who can work miracles in
favour of whom he chooseth, and say unto him, 'My patron greets
thee, and requests thy company to an entertainment five days
hence.'" The youth did as he was directed, and having returned to
his master, waited upon him as before, but anxiously wishing for
the fifth day to arrive.</p>

<p id="id04114">On the fifth day, the sage said to his impatient pupil, "Let us
remove to our own house, that we may prepare for the reception of
the sultan, whom you must conduct to me." They arose, and walked,
till on coming to a ruinous building about the middle of the
city, the walls of which were fallen in heaps, the shekh said,
"My son, this is my mansion, hasten and bring the sultan." The
pupil, in astonishment, exclaimed, "My lord, this abode is a heap
of ruins, how can I invite the sultan here, it would only
disgrace us?" "Go," repeated the sage, "and dread not the
consequences." Upon this the youth departed, but as he went on
could not help saying to himself, "Surely my master must be
insane, or means to make a jest of us." When he had reached the
palace he found the sultan expecting him; upon which he made his
obeisance, and said, "Will my lord honour me by his company?"</p>

<p id="id04115">The sultan arose, mounted his horse, and attended by his whole
court, followed the youth to the place chosen by the venerable
shekh. It now appeared a royal mansion, at the gates of which
were ranged numerous attendants in costly habits, respectfully
waiting. The young man, at sight of this transformed appearance,
was confounded in such a manner that he could hardly retain his
senses. He said to himself, "It was but this instant that I
beheld this place a heap of ruins, yet now it is a palace far
more magnificent than any belonging to this sultan. I am
astonished, but must keep the secret to myself."</p>

<p id="id04116">The sultan alighted, as did also his courtiers, and entered the
palace. They were surprised and delighted at the splendour of the
first court, but much more so at the superior magnificence of a
second; into which they were ushered, and introduced into a
spacious hall, where they found the venerable shekh sitting to
receive them. The sultan made a low obeisance; upon which the
sage just moved his head, but did not rise. The sultan then sat
down, when the shekh greeted him, and they entered into
conversation on various subjects; but the senses of the sultan
were confounded at the dignified demeanour of his host, and the
splendid objects around him. At length the shekh desired his
pupil to knock at a door and order breakfast to be brought in,
which he did: when lo! the door opened, and there entered a
hundred slaves, bearing upon their heads golden trays, on which
were placed dishes of agate, cornelian, and other stones, filled
with various eatables, which they arranged in order before the
sultan. He was astonished, for he had nothing so magnificent in
his own possession. He then partook of the sumptuous collation,
as did also the venerable shekh, and all the courtiers, till they
were satisfied; after which they drank coffee and sherbets of
various sorts, when the sultan and the sage conversed on
religious and literary subjects, and the former was edified by
the remarks of the latter.</p>

<p id="id04117">When it was noon the shekh again desired his pupil to knock at
another door, and order dinner to be brought in. He had no sooner
done so, than immediately a hundred slaves, different from the
former, entered, bearing trays of the richest viands. They spread
the cloth before the sultan, and arranged the dishes, which were
each thickly set with precious stones, at which he was more
astonished than before. When all had eaten till they were
satisfied, basins and ewers, some of gold and others of agate,
were carried round, and they washed their hands; after which the
shekh said to the sultan, "Have you fixed what my son must give
as the dower of your daughter?" To this, the sultan replied, "I
have already received it." This he said out of compliment; but
the shekh replied, "My lord, the marriage cannot be valid without
a dower." He then presented a vast sum of money, with many
jewels, for the purpose to his pupil; after which he retired with
the sultan into a chamber, and arrayed him in a splendid habit;
rich dresses were also given to each of his attendants according
to their rank. The sultan then took leave of the shekh, and
returned with his intended son-in-law to the palace.</p>

<p id="id04118">When evening arrived the young man was introduced into the
apartment of the princess, which he found spread with the richest
carpets, and perfumed with costly essences, but his bride was
absent: at which he was somewhat surprised, but supposed her
coming was put off till midnight, for which he waited with
impatience. Midnight came, but no bride appeared; when a thousand
uneasy sensations afflicted his mind, and he continued in
restless anxiety till morning: nor were the father and mother of
the princess less impatient; for supposing she was with her
husband, they waited anxiously, and were mortified at the delay.</p>

<p id="id04119">At daylight, the mother, unable to bear longer suspense, entered
the chamber; when the young man, rather angrily, inquired what
had delayed the coming of his bride. "She entered before thee,"
replied the mother. "I have not seen her," answered the
bridegroom. Upon this the sultana shrieked with affright, calling
aloud on her daughter, for she had no other child but her. Her
cries alarmed the sultan, who rushing into the apartment, was
informed that the princess was missing, and had not been seen
since her entrance in the evening. Search was now made in every
quarter of the palace, but in vain; and the sultan, sultana, and
the bridegroom, were involved in the deepest distress.</p>

<p id="id04120">To account for the sudden disappearance of the princess, be it
known, that a genie used often to divert himself with visiting
the haram of the sultan; and happening to be there on the
marriage night, was so captivated by the charms of the bride,
that he resolved to steal her away. Accordingly, having rendered
himself invisible, he waited in the nuptial chamber, and upon her
entering bore her off, and soared into the air. At length he
alighted with his prey in a delightful garden, far distant from
the city; placed the princess in a shady arbour, and set before
her delicious fruits; but contented himself with gazing upon her
beauty.</p>

<p id="id04121">The young bridegroom, when recovered from his first alarm,
bethought himself of his tutor, and, together with the sultan,
repaired to the palace where the splendid entertainment had been
given. Here they found every thing in the same order as on the
day of festivity, and were kindly received by the venerable
shekh; who on hearing of the loss of the princess, desired them
to be comforted. He then commanded a chafing-dish of lighted
charcoal to be set before him, and after some moments of
contemplation, cast into it some perfumes, over which he
pronounced incantations. He had scarcely ended them, when lo! the
earth shook, whirlwinds arose, lightnings flashed, and clouds of
dust darkened the air, from which speedily descended winged
troops, bearing superb standards and massive spears. In the
centre of them appeared three sultans of the genii, who bowing
low before the shekh, exclaimed all at once, "Master, hail! we
are come to obey thy commands."</p>

<p id="id04122">The shekh now addressed them, saying, "My orders are, that you
instantly bring me the accursed spirit who hath carried off the
bride of my son;" when the genii replied, "To hear is to obey:"
and immediately detached fifty of their followers to reconduct
the princess to her chamber, and drag the culprit to the presence
of the sage. These commands were no sooner issued than they were
performed. Ten of the genii carefully conveyed the bride to her
apartment, while the rest having seized the offending genie,
dragged him before the sage, who commanded the three sultans to
burn him to ashes, which was executed in an instant. All this was
done in the presence of the sultan, who was wrapt in
astonishment, and viewed with awe the tremendously gigantic
figures of the genii, wondering at the submissive readiness with
which they obeyed the commands of the venerable shekh. When the
offending genie was consumed to ashes, the shekh renewed his
incantations; during which the sultans of the genii, with their
followers, bowed themselves before him, and when he had ended,
vanished from sight.</p>

<p id="id04123">The sultan and the bridegroom having taken leave of the shekh,
returned to the palace, where all was now gladness for the safe
return of the princess. The marriage was consummated, and the
young man was so happy with his bride, that he did not quit the
haram for seven days. On the eighth, the sultan ordered public
rejoicings to be made, and invited all the inhabitants of the
city to feast at the royal cost; causing it to be proclaimed,
that no one, either rich or poor, should for three days presume
to eat at home, light a fire, or burn a lamp in his own house,
but all repair to the nuptial festival of the daughter of the
sultan. Ample provision was made for all comers in the courts of
the palace, and the officers of the household attended day and
night to serve the guests according to their quality. During one
of the nights of this grand festival, the sultan being anxious to
know if his proclamation was generally obeyed, resolved to walk
through the city in disguise. Accordingly he and his vizier, in
the habit of dervishes of Persia, having quitted the palace
privately, began their excursion, and narrowly examined several
streets. At length they came to a close alley, in one of the
houses of which they perceived a light, and heard the sound of
voices. When they had reached the door, they heard a person say
to another, "Our sultan understands not how to treat properly,
nor is he liberal, since the poor have it not in their option to
partake of the costly feast he has prepared for his daughter's
nuptials. He should have distributed his bounty among the
wretched, who dare not presume to enter the palace in their
ragged garments, by sending it to their home."</p>

<p id="id04124">The sultan, upon hearing this, said to the vizier, "We must enter
this house;" and knocked at the door, when a person cried out,
"Who is there?" "Guests," replied the sultan. "You shall be
welcome to what we have," answered the person, and opened the
door. On entering, the sultan beheld three mean-looking old men,
one of whom was lame, the second broken-backed, and the third
wry-mouthed. He then inquired the cause of their misfortunes; to
which they answered, "Our infirmities proceeded from the weakness
of our understandings." The sultan upon this replied in a whisper
to his vizier, that at the conclusion of the festival he should
bring the three men to his presence, in order that he might learn
their adventures.</p>

<p id="id04125">When they had tasted of their homely fare, the sultan and vizier
rose up, and having presented the three maimed companions with a
few deenars, took leave and departed. They strolled onwards. It
was now near midnight when they reached a house in which, through
a lattice, they could perceive three girls with their mother
eating a slender meal; during which, at intervals, one of them
sung, and the other two laughed and talked. The sultan resolved
to enter the house, and commanded the vizier to knock at the
door, which he did; when one of the sisters cried out, "Who
knocks at our door at this advanced time of night?" "We are two
foreign dervishes," replied the vizier; to which the ladies
answered, "We are women of virtue, and have no men in our house
to whom you can be introduced: repair to the festival of the
sultan, who will entertain you!" "Alas!" continued the vizier,
"we are strangers unacquainted with the way to the palace, and
dread lest the magistrate of the police should meet and apprehend
us. We beg that you will afford us lodging till daylight: we will
then depart, and you need not apprehend from us any improper
behaviour."</p>

<p id="id04126">When the mother of the ladies heard this she pitied the
strangers, and commanded them to open the door: upon which the
sultan and vizier having entered, paid their respects and sat
down; but the former, on observing the beauty of the sisters and
their elegant demeanour, could not contain himself, and said,
"How comes it that you dwell by yourselves, have no husbands or
any male to protect you?" The younger sister replied,
"Impertinent dervish, withhold thy inquiries! our story is
surprising; but unless thou wert sultan, and thy companion
vizier, you could not appreciate our adventures." The sultan upon
this remark became silent on the subject, and they discoursed
upon indifferent matters till near daylight, when the pretended
dervishes took a respectful leave, and departed. At the door the
sultan commanded the vizier to mark it, so that he might know it
again, being resolved, when the nuptial festivities should be
concluded, to send for the ladies and hear their story.</p>

<p id="id04127">On the last evening of the festival the sultan bestowed dresses
of honour on all his courtiers; and on the following day, affairs
returning to their usual course, he commanded his vizier to bring
before him the three maimed men, and ordered them to relate the
cause of their misfortunes, which they did as follows.</p>

<p id="id04128" style="margin-top: 4em">               Story of the Broken-backed Schoolmaster.</p>

<p id="id04129" style="margin-top: 3em">Formerly, O mighty sultan, was a schoolmaster, and had under my
tuition nearly seventy scholars, of whose manners I was as
careful as of their learning: so much did I make them respect me,
that whenever I sneezed they laid down their writing boards,
stood up with arms crossed, and with one voice exclaimed, "God
have mercy upon our tutor!" to which I replied, "May he have
mercy upon me and you, and all who have children." If any one of
the boys did not join in this prayer, I used to beat him
severely. One fine afternoon my scholars requested leave to visit
a certain garden some distance from the town, which I granted;
and they clubbed their pittances to purchase sweetmeats and
fruits. I attended them on this excursion, and was as much
delighted as themselves with the pleasure they enjoyed, and their
childish gambols. When evening approached we returned homewards,
and on the way, my boys having fatigued themselves with play, as
well as eaten much sweets and fruit, were seized with extreme
thirst, of which they heavily complained. At length we reached a
draw-well, but, alas! it had no bucket or cord. I pitied their
situation, and resolved, if possible, to relieve them. I
requested them to give me their turbans, which I tied to each
other; but as they were altogether not long enough to reach the
water, I fixed one of the turbans round my body, and made them
let one down into the well, where I filled a small cup I had with
me, which they drew up repeatedly till their thirst was
satisfied. I then desired them to draw me up again, which they
attempted; and I had reached nearly the mouth of the well, when I
was unfortunately seized with a fit of sneezing; upon which the
boys mechanically, as they had been accustomed to do in school,
one and all let go their hold, crossed their arms, and exclaimed,
"God have mercy upon our venerable tutor!" while I tumbled at
once to the bottom of the well, and broke my back. I cried out
from the agony of pain, and the children ran on all sides for
help. At length some charitable passengers drew me out, and
placing me upon an ass, carried me home; where I languished for a
considerable time, and never could recover my health sufficiently
again to attend to my school. Thus did I suffer for my foolish
pride: for had I not been so tenacious of respect from my
scholars, they would not upon my sneezing have let go their hold
and broken my back.</p>

<p id="id04130">When the broken-backed schoolmaster had finished his story, the
old man with the wry-mouth thus began:</p>

<p id="id04131" style="margin-top: 4em">             Story of the Wry-mouthed Schoolmaster.</p>

<p id="id04132" style="margin-top: 3em">I also, O sultan, was a schoolmaster; and so strict with my
pupils, that I allowed them no indulgence, but even kept them to
their studies frequently after the usual hours. At length, one
more cunning than the rest resolved, in revenge, to play me a
trick. He instructed the lads as they came into school to say to
me, "Dear master, how pale you look!" Not feeling myself ill, I,
though surprised at their remarks, did not much regard them on
the first day; but a second, and so on to a fifth passing, on
each of which all the pupils on entrance uttered the same
exclamation, I began to think some fatal disorder had seized me,
and resolved, by way of prevention, to take physic. I did so the
following morning, and remained in my wife's apartments; upon
which the unlucky lads, clubbing their pittances together to the
amount of about a hundred faloose, requested my acceptance of the
money as an offering for my recovery; and I was so pleased with
the present that I gave them a holiday. The receipt of cash in so
easy a manner was so agreeable to me, that I feigned illness for
some days; my pupils made an offering as usual, and were allowed
to play. On the tenth day the cunning urchin who had planned the
scheme came into my chamber, as customary, with an offering of
faloose. I happened then to have before me a boiled egg, which,
upon seeing him enter, I clapped into my mouth, supposing, that
if he perceived me well enough to eat he might not give me the
money. He, however, observed the trick, and coming up to me with
affected condolence, exclaimed, "Dear master, how your cheeks are
swelled!" at the same time pressing his hands upon my face. The
egg was boiling hot, and gave me intolerable pain, while the
young wit pretended compassionately to stroke my visage. At
length, he pressed my jaws together so hard that the egg broke,
when the scalding yolk ran down my throat, and over my beard:
upon which the artful lad cried out in seeming joy, "God be
praised, my dear master, that the dreadful imposthume has
discharged itself; we, your pupils, will all return thanks for
your happy recovery." My mouth was contracted by the scald in the
manner you behold, and I became so ridiculed for my folly, that I
was obliged to shut up my school.</p>

<p id="id04133">The sultan having heard the other man's story, which was of but
little interest, dismissed the three foolish schoolmasters with a
present, commanded the vizier to go and recognize the house of
the three ladies and their mother, it being his intention to
visit them again in disguise and hear their adventures. The
vizier hastened to the street, but to his surprise and
mortification found all the houses marked in the same manner, for
the youngest sister having overheard the sultan's instructions,
had done this to prevent a discovery of their residence. The
vizier returned to the sultan, and informed him of the trick
which had been played. He was much vexed, but the circumstance
excited his curiosity in a greater degree. At length the vizier
bethought himself of a stratagem, and said, "My lord, let a
proclamation be issued for four days successively throughout the
city, that whoever presumes after the first watch of the night to
have a lamp lighted in his house, shall have his head struck off,
his goods confiscated, his house razed to the ground, and his
women dishonoured. It is possible, as these ladies did not regard
your proclamation at the nuptials of the princess, they may
disobey this, and by that means we may discover their residence."</p>

<p id="id04134">The sultan approved the contrivance of the vizier, caused the
proclamation to be made, and waited impatiently for the fourth
night, when he and his minister having disguised themselves as
before, proceeded to the street in which the ladies lived. A
light appeared only in one house, which it being now tolerably
certain was that they were in quest of, they knocked at the door.</p>

<p id="id04135">Immediately on their knocking the youngest sister called out,
"Who is at the door?" and they replied, "We are dervishes, and
entreat to be your guests." She exclaimed, "What can you want at
such a late hour, and where did you lodge last night?" They
answered, "Our quarters are at a certain serai, but we have lost
our way, and are fearful of being apprehended by the officers of
police. Let your kindness then induce you to open the door, and
afford us shelter for the remainder of the night: it will be a
meritorious act in the eye of heaven." The mother overhearing
what was said, ordered the door to be opened.</p>

<p id="id04136">When they were admitted, the old lady and her daughters rose up,
received them respectfully, and having seated them, placed
refreshments before them, of which they partook, and were
delighted with their treatment. At length the sultan said,
"Daughters, you cannot but know of the royal proclamation; how
comes it that you alone of all the inhabitants of the city have
disobeyed it by having lights in your house after the first watch
of the night?" Upon this the youngest sister replied, "Good
dervish, even the sultan should not be obeyed but in his
reasonable commands, and as this proclamation against lighting
our lamps is tyrannical, it ought not to be complied with,
consistently with the law of scripture; for the Koraun says,
'Obedience to a creature in a criminal matter, is a sin against
the Creator.' The sultan (may God pardon him!) acts against
scripture, and obeys the dictates of Satan. We three sisters,
with our good mother, make it a rule to spin every night a
certain quantity of cotton, which in the morning we dispose of,
and of the price of our labour we lay out a part in provisions,
and the remainder in a new supply of materials for working to
procure us a subsistence."</p>

<p id="id04137">The sultan now whispered to his vizier, saying, "This damsel
astonishes me by her answers; endeavour to think of some question
that may perplex her." "My lord," replied the vizier, "we are
here in the characters of strangers and dervishes as their
guests: how then can we presume to disturb them by improper
questions?" The sultan still insisted upon his addressing them:
upon which, the vizier said to the ladies, "Obedience to the
sultan's orders is incumbent upon all subjects." "It is true he
is our sovereign," exclaimed the youngest sister, "but how can he
know whether we are starving or in affluence?" "Suppose," replied
the vizier, "he should send for you to the presence, and question
you concerning your disobedience to his commands, what could you
advance in excuse for yourselves?" "I would say to the sultan,"
rejoined she, "'Your majesty has acted in contradiction to the
divine law.'"</p>

<p id="id04138">The vizier upon this turned towards the sultan, and said in a
whisper, "Let us leave off disputing further with this lady on
points of law or conscience, and inquire if she understands the
fine arts." The sultan put the question; upon which she replied,
"I am perfect in all:" and he then requested her to play and
sing. She retired immediately, but soon returning with a lute,
sat down, tuned it, and played in a plaintive strain, which she
accompanied with the following verses:</p>

<p id="id04139">"It is praiseworthy in subjects to obey their sovereigns, but his
reign will continue long who gains their affections by kindness.
Be liberal in thy manners, and he who is dependent upon thee will
pray for thy life, for the free man alone can feel gratitude. To
him who confers gifts man will ever resort, for bounty is
fascinating. Sadden not with denial the countenance of the man of
genius, for the liberal mind is disgusted at stinginess and
haughty demeanour. Not a tenth part of mankind understand what is
right, for human nature is ignorant, rebellious, and ungrateful."</p>

<p id="id04140">When the sultan had heard these verses, he remained for some time
immersed in thought; then whispering his vizier, said, "This
quotation was certainly meant in allusion to ourselves, and I am
convinced they must know that I am their sultan, and thou vizier,
for the whole tenor of their conversation shews their knowledge
of us." He then addressed the lady, saying, "Your music, your
performance, your voice, and the subject of your stanzas have
delighted me beyond expression." Upon this she sang the following
verse:</p>

<p id="id04141">"Men endeavour to attain station and riches during an age of toil
and oppression, while, alas! their accounts to heaven and their
graves are decreed from their very birth."</p>

<p id="id04142">The sultan, from the purport of these last verses, was more
assured than ever that she knew his quality. She did not leave
off singing and playing till day-light, when she retired, and
brought in a breakfast, of which the sultan and the vizier
partook; after which she said, "I hope you will return to us this
night at the conclusion of the first watch, and be our guests."
The sultan promised, and departed in admiration at the beauty of
the sisters, their accomplishments, and graceful manners; saying
to the vizier, "My soul is delighted with the charms of these
elegant women."</p>

<p id="id04143">The following evening the sultan and vizier, disguised as usual,
repaired to the house of the sisters, taking with them some
purses of deenars, and were received with the same respectful
welcome. Being seated, supper was set before them, and after it
basins and ewers to wash their hands. Coffee was then served up,
and conversation on various subjects amused them till the prayer
time of the first watch; they then arose, performed their
ablutions, and prayed. When, their devotions were ended, the
sultan presented a purse of a thousand deenars to the youngest
sister, and said, "Expend this upon your necessary occasions."
She took the purse with a profound obeisance, kissed his hands,
and was convinced, as she had before suspected, that he must be
the sultan; at the same time hinting privately to her mother and
sisters the quality of their guests, and prostrating herself
before him.</p>

<p id="id04144">The other ladies upon this arose, and followed the example of
their sister; when the sultan said aside to his vizier, "They
certainly know us:" and then turning to the ladies, addressed
them saying, "We are merely dervishes, and you pay us a respect
only due to sovereigns; I beseech you refrain." The youngest
sister again fell at his feet, and repeated the following verse:</p>

<p id="id04145">"May prosperous fortune daily accompany thee in spite of the
malice of the envious! May thy days be bright and those of thy
enemies gloomy!"</p>

<p id="id04146">"I am convinced thou art the sultan, and thy companion thy
vizier." The sultan replied, "What reason have you for such a
supposition?" She answered, "From your dignified demeanour and
liberal conduct, for the signs of royalty cannot be concealed
even in the habit of a recluse."</p>

<p id="id04147">The sultan replied, "You have indeed judged truly, but inform me
how happens it, that you have with you no male protectors?" She
answered, "My lord the sultan, our history is so wonderful, that
were it written on a tablet of adamant it might serve as an
example in future ages to such as would be advised." The sultan
requested her to relate it, which she did in the following
manner.</p>

<p id="id04148" style="margin-top: 4em">         Story of the Sisters and the Sultana their Mother.</p>

<p id="id04149" style="margin-top: 3em">We are not, my lord the sultan, natives of this city, but of
Eerauk, of which country our father was sovereign, and our mother
his sultana the most beautiful woman of her time, insomuch that
her fame was celebrated throughout distant regions. It chanced
that in our infancy our father the sultan marched upon a hunting
excursion throughout his dominions, for some months, leaving his
vizier to conduct affairs at the capital. Not long after the
departure of the sultan, our mother, taking the air on the roof
of the palace, which adjoined that of the vizier, who was then
sitting upon his terrace, her image was reflected in a mirror
which he held in his hand. He was fascinated with her beauty, and
resolved, if possible, to seduce her to infidelity and compliance
with his wishes.</p>

<p id="id04150">The day following he sent the female superintendant of his haram
with a package, containing a most superb dress, and many
inestimable jewels, to the sultana, requesting her acceptance of
them, and that she would allow him to see her either at the
palace or at his own house. My mother, when the old woman was
admitted into her apartments, received her with kindness,
supposing that she must be intrusted with some confidential
message from the vizier respecting the affairs of her husband, or
with letters from him.</p>

<p id="id04151">The old woman having paid her obeisance, opened the bundle, and
displayed the rich dress and dazzling jewels; when my mother,
admiring them much, inquired the value, and what merchant had
brought them to dispose of. The wretched old woman, supposing
that the virtue of the sultana would not be proof against such a
valuable present, impudently disclosed the passion of the vizier:
upon which my mother, indignant with rage at this insult offered
to her virtue and dignity, drew a sabre, which was near, and
exerting all her strength, struck off the head of the procuress,
which, with the body, she commanded her attendants to cast into
the common sewer of the palace.</p>

<p id="id04152">The vizier finding his messenger did not return, the next day
despatched another, to signify that he had sent a present to the
sultana, but had not heard whether it had been delivered. My
mother commanded the infamous wretch to be strangled, and the
corpse to be thrown into the same place as that of the old woman,
but she did not make public the vizier's baseness, hoping that he
would reform. He, however, continued every day to send a female
domestic, and my mother to treat her in the same way as the
others till the sultan's return; but my mother, not wishing to
destroy the vizier, and still trusting that he would repent of
his conduct, for in other respects he was a faithful and prudent
minister, kept his treachery a secret from my father.</p>

<p id="id04153">Some years after this, the sultan my father resolved on a
pilgrimage to Mecca, and having, as before, left the vizier in
charge of his kingdom, departed. When he had been gone ten days,
the vizier, still rapturously in love, and yet presumtuously
hoping to attain his wishes, sent a female domestic, who, being
admitted into the apartment of the sultana, said, "For Heaven's
sake have compassion on my master, for his heart is devoted to
love, his senses are disturbed, and his body is wasted away. Pity
his condition, revive his heart, and restore his health by the
smiles of condescension."</p>

<p id="id04154">When my mother heard this insolent message, she in a rage
commanded her attendants to seize the unfortunate bearer, and
having strangled her, to leave the carcase for public view in the
outer court of the palace, but without divulging the cause of her
displeasure. Her orders were obeyed. When the officers of state
and others saw the body they informed the vizier, who, resolving
to be revenged, desired them for the present to be silent, and on
the sultan's return he would make known on what account the
sultana had put to death his domestic, of which they could bear
testimony.</p>

<p id="id04155">When the time of the sultan's return from Mecca approached, and
the treacherous vizier judged he was on his march, he wrote and
despatched to him the following letter:</p>

<p id="id04156">"After prayers for thy health, be it known, that since thy
absence the sultana has sent to me five times, requesting
improper compliances, to which I would not consent, and returned
for answer, that however she might wish to abuse my sovereign, I
could not do it, for I was left by him guardian of his honour and
his kingdom: to say more would be superfluous."</p>

<p id="id04157">The messenger reached the sultan's camp when distant eight days'
journey from the city, and delivered the letter. On reading it
the countenance of my father became pale, his eyes rolled with
horror, he instantly ordered his tents to be struck, and moved by
forced marches till he arrived within two days' journey of his
capital. He then commanded a halting day, and despatched two
confidential attendants with orders to conduct our innocent and
unfortunate mother, with us three sisters, a day's distance from
the city, and then to put us to death. They accordingly dragged
us from the haram, and carried us into the country; but on
arriving at the spot intended for our execution, their hearts
were moved with compassion, for our mother had conferred many
obligations on these men and their families. They said one to
another, "By heavens, we cannot murder them!" and informed us of
what the vizier had written to our father: upon which the sultana
exclaimed, "God knows that he hath most falsely accused me;" and
she then related to them all that she had done, with the
strictest fidelity.</p>

<p id="id04158">The men were moved even to tears at her misfortunes, and said,
"We are convinced that thou hast spoken truly." They then caught
some fawns of the antelope, killed them, and having required an
under garment from each of us, dipped it in the blood, after
which they broiled the flesh, with which we satisfied our hunger.
Our preservers now bade us farewell, saying, "We intrust you to
the protection of the Almighty, who never forsaketh those who are
committed to his care;" and then departed from us. We wandered
for ten days in the desert, living on such fruits as we could
find, without beholding any signs of population, when, at length,
fortunately we reached a verdant spot, abounding in various sorts
of excellent vegetables and fruits. Here also was a cave, in
which we resolved to shelter ourselves till a caravan might pass
by. On the fourth day of our arrival one encamped near our
asylum. We did not discover ourselves, but when the caravan
marched, speedily followed its track at some distance, and after
many days of painful exertion reached this city, where, having
taken up our lodging in a serai, we returned thanks to the
almighty assister of the distressed innocent for our miraculous
escape from death and the perils of the desert.</p>

<p id="id04159">We must now quit for awhile the unfortunate sultana and her
daughters, to learn the adventures of the sultan her husband. As
he drew near his capital, the treacherous vizier, attended by the
officers of government and the principal inhabitants of the city,
came out to meet him; and both high and low congratulated his
safe return from the sacred pilgrimage.</p>

<p id="id04160">The sultan, as soon as he had alighted at his palace, retired
with the vizier alone, and commanded him to relate the
particulars of the atrocious conduct of his wife; upon which he
said, "My lord, the sultana in your absence despatched to me a
slave, desiring me to visit her, but I would not, and I put the
slave to death that the secret might be hidden; hoping she might
repent of her weakness, but she did not, and repeated her wicked
invitation five times. On the fifth I was alarmed for your
honour, and acquainted you of her atrocious behaviour."</p>

<p id="id04161">The sultan, on hearing the relation of the vizier, held down his
head for some time in profound thought, then lifting it up,
commanded the two attendants whom he had despatched with orders
to put his wife and children to death to be brought before him.
On their appearance, he said, "What have you done in execution of
the charge I gave you?" they replied, "We have performed that
which you commanded to be done, and as a testimony of our
fidelity, behold these garments dyed with the blood of the
offenders!" The sultan took the garments; but the recollection of
his beauteous consort, her former affectionate endearments, of
the happiness he had enjoyed with her, and of the innocence of
his guiltless children, so affected his mind, that he wept
bitterly and fainted away. On his recovery he turned to the
vizier, and said, "Is it possible thou canst have spoken the
truth?" He replied, "I have."</p>

<p id="id04162">The sultan, after a long pause, again said to the two attendants,
"Have you really put to death my innocent children with their
guilty mother?" They remained silent. The sultan exclaimed, "Why
answer ye not, and wherefore are ye silent?" They replied, "My
lord, the honest man cannot support a lie, for lying is the
distinction of traitors." When the vizier heard these words his
colour changed, his whole frame was disordered, and a trembling
seized him, which the sultan perceiving, he said to the
attendants, "What mean you by remarking that lying is the
distinction of traitors? Is it possible that ye have not put them
to death? Declare the truth instantly, or by the God who hath
appointed me guardian of his people, I will have you executed
with the most excruciating torments."</p>

<p id="id04163">The two men now fell at the feet of the sultan, and said, "Dread
sovereign, we conveyed, as thou commandest us, the unfortunate
sultana and thy daughters to the middle of the desert, when we
informed them of the accusation of the vizier and thy orders
concerning them. The sultana, after listening to us with
fortitude, exclaimed, 'There is no refuge or asylum but with the
Almighty; from God we came, and to God we must return; but if you
put us to death, you will do it wrongfully, for the treacherous
vizier hath accused me falsely, and he alone is guilty.' She then
informed us of his having endeavoured to corrupt her by rich
presents, and that she had put his messengers to death."</p>

<p id="id04164">The sultan at these words exclaimed in agony, "Have ye slain
them, or do they yet live?" "My lord," replied the attendants,
"We were so convinced of the innocence of the sultana, that we
could not put her to death. We caught some fawn antelopes, killed
them, and having dipped these garments belonging to the abused
mother and your children in their blood, dressed the flesh, and
gave it to our unfortunate mistress and thy daughters, after
which we said to them, 'We leave you in charge of a gracious God
who never deserts his trust; your innocence will protect you.' We
then left them in the midst of the desert, and returned to the
city."</p>

<p id="id04165">The sultan turned in fury towards the vizier, and exclaimed,
"Wretched traitor! and is it thus thou hast estranged from me my
beloved wife and innocent children?" The self-convicted minister
uttered not a word, but trembled like one afflicted with the
palsy. The sultan commanded instantly an enormous pile of wood to
be kindled, and the vizier, being bound hand and foot, was forced
into an engine, and cast from it into the fire, which rapidly
consumed him to ashes. His house was then razed to the ground,
his effects left to the plunder of the populace, and the women of
his haram and his children sold for slaves.</p>

<p id="id04166">We now return to the three princesses and their mother. When the
sultan had heard their adventures, he sympathized with their
misfortunes, and was astonished at the fortitude with which they
had borne their afflictions, saying to his vizier, "How sad has
been their lot! but blessed be Allah, who, as he separateth
friends, can, when he pleaseth, give them a joyful meeting." He
then caused the sultana and the princesses to be conveyed to his
palace, appointed them proper attendants and apartments suitable
to their rank, and despatched couriers to inform the sultan their
father of their safety. The messengers travelled with the
greatest expedition, and on their arrival at the capital, being
introduced, presented their despatches. The sultan opened them,
and began to read; but when he perceived the contents, was so
overcome with joy, that, uttering a loud exclamation of rapture,
he fell to the ground and fainted away. His attendants were
alarmed, lifted him up, and took means for his recovery. When he
was revived, he informed them of his sultana and daughters being
still alive, and ordered a vessel to be prepared to convey them
home.</p>

<p id="id04167">The ship was soon ready, and being laden with every necessary for
the accommodation of his family, also rich presents for the
friendly sultan who had afforded them protection, sailed with a
favourable wind, and speedily arrived at the desired haven.</p>

<p id="id04168">The commander of the vessel was welcomely received by the sultan,
who issued orders for his entertainment and that of his whole
crew at the royal cost, and at the expiration of three days the
sultana and her daughters, being anxious to return home after so
long an absence, and that so unfortunate, took leave and
embarked. The sultan made them valuable presents, and the wind
being fair they set sail. For three days the weather was
propitious, but on the evening of the last a contrary gale arose,
when they cast anchor, and lowered their topmasts. At length the
storm increased to such violence that the anchor parted, the
masts fell overboard, and the crew gave themselves over for lost.
The vessel was driven about at the mercy of the tempest till
midnight, all on board weeping and wailing, when at length she
struck upon the rocks, and went to pieces. Such of the crew whose
deaths were decreed perished, and those whose longer life was
predestined escaped to shore, some on planks, some on chests, and
some on the broken timbers of the ship, but all separated from
each other.</p>

<p id="id04169">The sultana mother was tossed about till daylight on a plank,
when she was perceived by the commander of the vessel, who with
three of his crew had taken to the ship's boat. He took her in,
and after three days' rowing they reached a mountainous coast, on
which they landed, and advanced into the country. They had not
proceeded far when they perceived a great dust, which clearing
up, displayed an approaching army. To their joyful surprise it
proved to be that of the sultan, who, after the departure of the
vessel, dreading lest an accident might happen, had marched in
hopes of reaching the city where they were before his wife and
daughters should sail, in order to conduct them home by land. It
is impossible to describe the meeting of the sultan and his
consort, but their joy was clouded by the absence of their
daughters, and the dreadful uncertainty of their fate. When the
first raptures of meeting were over, they wept together, and
exclaimed, "We are from God, and to God we must return." After
forty days' march they arrived at their capital, but continually
regretting the princesses, saying, "Alas, alas! most probably
they have been drowned, but even should they have escaped to
shore, perhaps they may have been separated; and ah! what
calamities may have befallen them!" Constantly did they bemoan
together in this manner, immersed in grief, and taking no
pleasure in the enjoyments of life.</p>

<p id="id04170">The youngest princess, after struggling with the waves till
almost exhausted, was fortunately cast ashore on a pleasant
coast, where she found some excellent fruits and clear fresh
water. Being revived, she reposed herself awhile, and then walked
from the beach into the country; but she had not proceeded far,
when a young man on horseback with some dogs following him met
her, and upon hearing that she had just escaped shipwreck,
mounted her before him, and having conveyed her to his house,
committed her to the care of his mother. She received her with
compassionate kindness, and during a whole month assiduously
attended her, till by degrees she recovered her health and
beauty.</p>

<p id="id04171">The young man was legal heir to the kingdom, but his succession
had been wrested from him by a usurper, who, however, dying soon
after the arrival of the princess, he was reinstated in his
rights and placed on the throne, when he offered her his hand;
but she said, "How can I think of marriage while I know not the
condition of my unfortunate family, or enjoy repose while my
mother and sisters are perhaps suffering misery? When I have
intelligence of their welfare I will be grateful to my
deliverer."</p>

<p id="id04172">The young sultan was so much in love with the princess, that the
most distant hope gave him comfort, and he endeavoured to wait
patiently her pleasure; but the nobles of the country were
anxious to see him wedded, he being the last of his race, and
importuned him to marry. He promised to conform to their wishes,
but much time elapsing, they became importunate and discontented,
when his mother, dreading a rebellion, earnestly entreated the
princess to consent to a union as the only measure that could
prevent disturbances. The princess, who really loved her
preserver, was unwilling to endanger the safety of one to whom
she owed such important obligations, and at length consented,
when the marriage was celebrated with the greatest pomp and
rejoicings. At the expiration of three years the sultana was
delivered of two sons, whose birth added to the felicity of the
union.</p>

<p id="id04173">The second princess, after being long driven about by the waves
upon a plank, was at length cast on shore near a large city,
which she entered, and was fortunately compassionated by a
venerable matron, who invited her to her house, and adopted her
as a daughter in the room of her own, who had lately died. Here
she soon recovered her health and beauty. It chanced that the
sultan of this city, who was much beloved for his gentle
government and liberality, was taken ill, and not withstanding
the skill of the most celebrated physicians, daily became worse,
insomuch that his life was despaired of, to the general grief of
the people. The princess having heard her venerable protectress
lament the danger of the sultan, said, "My dear mother, I will
prepare a dish of pottage, which, if you will carry to the
sultan, and he can be prevailed upon to eat it, will, by the
blessing of Allah, recover him from his disorder." "I fear,"
replied the matron, "I shall hardly be allowed admittance to the
palace, much less to present him the pottage." "You can but try,"
answered the princess; "and even the attempt at a good action is
acceptable to God." "Well," rejoined the old woman,  "prepare your
pottage, my dear daughter, and I will endeavour to get
admission."</p>

<p id="id04174">The princess prepared the dish of pottage, composed of various
minerals, herbs, and perfumes, and when it was ready the old
woman took it to the sultan's palace. The guards and eunuchs
inquired what she had brought, when she said, "A dish of pottage,
which I request you will present to the sultan, and beg him to
eat as much of it as he can, for by God's help it will restore
him to health." The eunuchs introduced her into the chamber of
their sick sovereign, when the old woman taking off the cover of
the dish, such a grateful perfume exhaled from the contents as
revived his spirits. Being informed what the venerable matron had
brought, he thanked her and tasted the pottage, which was so
agreeably flavoured that he ate part of it with an appetite to
which he had been long a stranger. He then presented the bearer
with a purse of deenars, when she returned home, informed the
princess of her welcome reception, and of the present she had
received.</p>

<p id="id04175">The sultan had no sooner eaten part of the pottage than he felt
an inclination to repose, and sunk into a refreshing sleep, which
lasted for some hours. On his awakening he found himself
wonderfully revived, and having a desire afresh to eat, finished
the whole. He now wished for more, and inquired after the old
woman, but none of his attendants could inform him where she
lived. However, in the evening she brought another mess, which
the princess had prepared, and the sultan ate it with renewed
appetite; after which, though before quite helpless, he was now
able to sit up and even to walk. He inquired of the old woman if
it was her own preparation; to which she replied, "No, my lord,
but my daughter dressed it, and entreated me to bring it." The
sultan exclaimed, "She cannot be thy own daughter, as her skill
shews her of much higher quality." He then made her a present,
and requested that she would bring him every morning a fresh
supply, to which she said, "To hear is to obey;" and retired.</p>

<p id="id04176">The princess sent regularly for seven mornings successively a
dish of pottage, and the sultan as regularly presented her
adopted mother with a purse of deenars; for such was the rapidity
of his recovery, that at the expiration of the sixth day he was
perfectly well, and on the seventh he mounted his horse and
repaired to his country palace to make the absolution of health
and enjoy the fresh air. During her visits he had questioned the
old lady concerning her adopted daughter, and she so described
her beauty, virtues, and accomplishments, that his heart was
smitten, and he became anxious to see her.</p>

<p id="id04177">The sultan, in order to gratify his curiosity, disguised himself
one day in the habit of a dervish, and repairing to the house of
the old woman, knocked at the door. On being questioned what he
wanted, he replied, "I am a wandering dervish, a stranger in this
city, and distressed with hunger." The old woman being fearful of
admitting an unknown person, would have sent him away, but the
princess exclaimed, "Hospitality to strangers is incumbent upon
us, especially to the religious poor." Upon this he was admitted,
and the princess having seated him respectfully, set victuals
before him, of which he ate till he was satisfied, and having
washed, rose up, thanked the old woman and her supposed daughter
for their bounty, and retired, but his sight was fascinated with
her beauty, and his heart devoted to her love.</p>

<p id="id04178">The sultan on his return to the palace sent for the old woman,
and on her arrival presented her with a rich dress and valuable
jewels, desiring that she would give them to her daughter, and
prevail upon her to put them on. The old lady promised obedience,
and as she walked homewards, said to herself, "If this adopted
daughter of mine is wise, she will comply with the sultan's
desires, and put on the dress, but if she does not, I will expel
her from my house." When she reached home, she displayed the
superb habit and the dazzling ornaments; but the princess at
first refused to accept them, till at length, moved by the
entreaties of her protectress, whom she could not disoblige, she
put them on, and the old lady was delighted with her appearance.</p>

<p id="id04179">The sultan, who had slipped on a female dress, having covered
himself with a close veil, followed the old woman to her house,
and listened at the door to know if the daughter would accept his
present. When he found that she had put on the dress, he was
overcome with rapture, and hastening back to his palace, sent
again for the old lady, to whom he signified his wish to marry
her daughter. When the princess was informed of the offer she
consented, and the sultan, attended by a splendid cavalcade,
conducted her that evening to his palace, where the cauzee united
them in marriage. A general feast was made for all the
inhabitants of the city for seven days successively, and the
sultan and the princess enjoyed the height of felicity. In the
course of five years the Almighty blessed them with a son and two
daughters.</p>

<p id="id04180">The eldest princess on the wreck of the ship having clung to a
piece of timber, was after much distress floated on shore, where
she found a man's habit, and thinking it a safe disguise for the
protection of her honour, she dressed herself in it, and
proceeded to a city which appeared near the coast. On her
entrance she was accosted by a maker of cotton wallets for
travelling, who observing that she was a stranger, and supposing
her a man, asked if she would live with him, as he wanted an
assistant. Being glad to secure any asylum, she accepted his
offer of maintenance, and daily wages of half a dirhem. He
conducted her to his house, and treated her with kindness. The
next day she entered upon her business, and so neat was the work
she executed, that in a short time her master's shop was more
frequented than any other.</p>

<p id="id04181">It happened that the shop was situated near the palace of the
sultan. One morning the princess his daughter looking through the
lattice of a balcony beheld the seeming young man at work, with
the sleeves of his vest drawn up to his shoulder: his arms were
white and polished as silver, and his countenance brilliant as
the sun unobscured by clouds. The daughter of the sultan was
captivated in the snare of love.</p>

<p id="id04182">The sultan's daughter continued gazing at the supposed young man
till he withdrew from work, when she retired to her apartment;
but so much was she fascinated by his charms, that she became
restless, and at length indisposed. Her nurse who attended her
felt her pulse, and asked her several questions, but could find
no symptoms of bodily illness upon her. She said, "My dear
daughter, I am convinced that nothing has afflicted thee but
desire of some youth with whom thou art in love." The princess
exclaimed, "My dear mother, as thou hast discovered my secret,
thou wilt, I trust, not only keep it sacred, but bring to me the
man I love." The nurse replied, "No one can keep a secret closer
than myself, so that you may safely confide it to my care." The
princess then said, "Mother, my heart is captivated by the young
man who works in the shop opposite my windows, and if I cannot
meet him I shall die of grief."</p>

<p id="id04183">The nurse replied, "My dear mistress, he is the most beautiful
youth of the age, and the women of the whole city are distracted
with his charms; yet he is so bashful as to answer no advances,
and shrinks from notice like a school-boy, but I will endeavour
to overcome his shyness, and procure you a meeting." Having said
thus, she went immediately to the wallet-maker's, and giving him
a piece of gold, desired he would let his assistant accompany her
home with two of his best wallets. The man was pleased with her
generosity, and selecting his choicest manufacture, commanded his
journeyman to accompany the nurse.</p>

<p id="id04184">The old woman led the disguised princess through by-paths to a
private passage of the palace, and introduced her into the
apartments of the daughter of the sultan, who received her
supposed beloved with emotions of joy too violent to be
concealed. Pretending to admire the goods, she asked some
questions, and giving him twenty pieces of gold, desired him to
return with more goods on the following evening, to which the
seeming journeyman replied, "To hear is to obey."</p>

<p id="id04185">The disguised princess on her return home delivered the twenty
pieces of gold to her employer, who was alarmed, and inquired
from whence they came: upon which she informed him of her
adventure, when the   wallet-maker was in greater terror than
before, and said to himself, "If this intrigue goes on, the
sultan will discover it, I shall be put to death, and my family
ruined on account of this young man and his follies." He then
besought him not to repeat his visit, but he answered, "I cannot
forbear, though I dread my death may be the consequence." In
short, the disguised princess went every evening with the old
nurse to the apartments of the sultan's daughter, till at length
the sultan one night suddenly entered, and perceiving, he
supposed, a man with the princess, commanded him to be seized and
bound hand and foot.</p>

<p id="id04186">The sultan then sent for an executioner, resolved to put the
culprit to death. The executioner on his arrival seized the
disguised princess; but what was the surprise of all present,
when, on taking off the turban and vest, they discovered her sex.
The sultan commanded her to be conducted to his haram, and
inquired her story, when having no resource but the truth, she
related her adventures.</p>

<p id="id04187">When the princess had informed the sultan of the treachery of the
vizier, the consequent conduct of her father, the distress of her
mother, her sisters and herself, their being relieved, and her
escape from shipwreck, with what had happened since, he was
filled with wonder and compassion, and ordered his daughter to
accommodate her in the haram. The love of the latter was now
changed to sincere friendship, and under her care and attentions
the unfortunate princess in a few months recovered her former
beauty. It chanced that the sultan visiting his daughter was
fascinated with the charms of the princess, but unwilling to
infringe the rules of hospitality concealed his love, till at
length he became dangerously ill, when the daughter suspecting
the matter, prevailed upon him to reveal the cause of his
complaint. She then informed her friend, and entreated her to
accept her father in marriage; but the princess said, at the same
time weeping bitterly, "Misfortune hath separated me from my
family; I know not whether my sisters, my father and my mother,
are living, or, if so, what is their condition. How can I be
happy or merry, while they are perhaps involved in misery?"</p>

<p id="id04188">The daughter of the sultan did not refrain from comforting the
unfortunate princess, at the same time representing the hopeless
condition of her father, till at length she consented to the
marriage. This joyful intelligence speedily revived the love-lorn
sultan, and the nuptials were celebrated with the utmost joy and
magnificence.</p>

<p id="id04189">The aged sultan and sultana continued to lament the loss of their
daughters for some years, when at length the former resolved to
travel in search of them, and having left the government in
charge of his wife, departed, attended only by his vizier. They
both assumed the habit of dervishes, and after a month's
uninterrupted travelling reached a large city extending along the
sea coast, close upon which the sultan of it had erected a
magnificent pleasure house, where the pretended dervishes beheld
him sitting in one of the pavilions with his two sons, one six
and the other seven years old. They approached, made their
obeisance, and uttered a long invocation, agreeably to the usage
of the religious, for his prosperity. The sultan returned their
compliment, desired them to be seated, and having conversed with
them till evening, dismissed them with a present, when they
repaired to a caravanserai, and hired an apartment. On the
following day, after amusing themselves with viewing the city,
they again repaired to the beach, and saw the sultan sitting with
his children, as before. While they were admiring the beauty of
the structure, the younger prince, impelled by an unaccountable
impulse, came up to them, gazed eagerly at them, and when they
retired followed them to their lodging, which they did not
perceive till he had entered with them and sat down. The old
sultan was astonished at the child's behaviour, took him in his
arms, kissed and fondled him, after which he desired him to
return to his parents, but the boy insisted upon staying, and
remained four days, during which the pretended dervishes did not
stir from their caravanserai.</p>

<p id="id04190">The sultan missing his son, supposed that he had gone to his
mother, and she imagined that he was still with his father; but
on the latter entering the haram the loss was discovered.
Messengers were despatched every way, but no tidings of the boy
could be obtained. The miserable parents now supposed that he had
fallen into the sea and was drowned. Nets were dragged, and
divers employed for three days, but in vain. On the fifth day
orders were issued to search every house in the city, when the
infant prince was at length discovered at the caravanserai in the
apartment of the pretended dervishes, who were ignominiously
dragged before the sultan.</p>

<p id="id04191">The sultan was transported with joy at the recovery of his son,
but supposing the dervishes had meant to steal him away, he
ordered them instantly to be put to death. The executioners
seized them, bound their hands behind them, and were going to
strike, when the child with loud outcries ran up, and clinging to
the knees of the elder victim could not be forced away. The
sultan was astonished, and ordering the execution for the present
to be delayed, went and informed the mother of the child of his
wonderful behaviour.</p>

<p id="id04192">The sultana, on hearing it, was no less surprised than the
sultan, and felt a curiosity to hear from the dervish himself on
what account he had enticed away her son. She said, "It is truly
extraordinary that the boy should express such affection for a
strange dervish. Send for him to your closet, and order him to
relate his adventures, to which I will listen from behind a
curtain."</p>

<p id="id04193">The sultan sent for the supposed dervish, and commanding all his
attendants to retire, withdrew with him into his closet, and
desired him to be seated; after which he said, "Wicked dervish,
what could have induced thee to entice away my son, or to visit
my kingdom?" He replied, "Heaven knows, O sultan, I did not
entice him. The boy followed me to my lodging, when I said, 'My
son, return to thy father,' but he would not; and I remained in
continual dread till what was decreed occurred." The sultan was
softened, spoke kindly to him, and begged him to relate his
adventures, when the pretended dervish wept, and said, "My
history is a wonderful one. I had a friend whom I left as my
agent and guardian to my family, while I was performing a
pilgrimage to Mecca; but had scarcely left my house ten days,
when accidently seeing my wife he endeavoured to debauch her, and
sent an old woman with a rich present to declare his adulterous
love. My wife was enraged, and put the infamous messenger to
death. He sent a second, and a third, whom she also killed."</p>

<p id="id04194">These last words were scarcely spoken, when the sultana bursting
from her concealment ran up to the dervish, fell upon his neck,
and embraced him: upon which, the sultan her husband was enraged,
put his hand to his cimeter, and exclaimed, "What means this
shameless behaviour?" The sultana, at once laughing and crying
with rapture, informed him that the supposed dervish was her
father: upon which the sultan also fell at his feet and welcomed
him. He then ordered the other dervish his vizier to be released,
commanded royal robes to be brought for his father-in-law, and a
suite of apartments in the palace to be prepared for his
reception, with an attendance befitting his dignity.</p>

<p id="id04195">When the old sultan had spent some time with his youngest
daughter thus happily recovered, he became anxious to search
after the others, and signified his intention of departing; but
his son-in-law declared that he would accompany him on the
expedition with a number of his nobles, and an army, lest some
fatal accident might occur from his being unattended.
Preparations were accordingly made for march, the two sultans
encamped without the city, and in a few days began their
expedition, which proved successful to their wishes. The aged
monarch having recovered his children retired to his own kingdom,
where he reigned prosperously till the angel of death summoned
him to Paradise.</p>

<h2 id="id04196" style="margin-top: 4em">            STORY OF THE BANG-EATER AND THE CAUZEE.</h2>

<p id="id04197" style="margin-top: 3em">In a certain city there was a vagabond fellow much addicted to
the use of bang, who got his livelihood by fishing. When he had
sold the product of his day's labour, he laid part of it out in
provisions and part in bang, with which (his day's, work over) he
solaced himself till he became intoxicated, and such was his
constant practice. One night, having indulged more than ordinary,
his senses were unusually stupefied; and in this, condition he
had occasion to come down into the square in which was his
lodging. It happened to be the fourteenth night of the moon, when
she shone uncommonly bright, and shed such a lustre upon the
ground, that the bang-eater from the dizziness of his head
mistook the bright undulations of her reflection on the pavement
for water, and fancied he was upon the brink of the river. He
returned to his chamber, and brought down his line, supposing
that he should catch his usual prey.</p>

<p id="id04198">The bang-eater threw out his line, made of strong cord, and
baited on several hooks with bits of flesh, into the square, when
a dog, allured by the scent, swallowed one of the pieces, and
feeling pain from the hook which stuck in his throat, pulled
strongly at the cord. The bang-eater, supposing he had caught a
monstrous fish, lugged stoutly, but in vain. The dog, agonized by
the hook, resisted; at the same time yelping hideously, when the
bang-eater, unwilling to quit his prey, yet fearing he should be
dragged into the imaginary river, bellowed aloud for help. The
watch came up, seized him, and perceiving him intoxicated,
carried him bound to the cauzee.</p>

<p id="id04199">It happened that the cauzee often privately indulged himself with
bang. Seeing the intoxicated situation of the fisherman, he
pitied his condition, and ordered him to be put into a chamber to
sleep off his disorder; at the same time saying to himself, "This
is a man after my own heart, and to-morrow evening I will enjoy
myself with him." The fisherman was well taken care of during the
day, and at night the cauzee sent for him to his apartment;
where, after eating, they took each a powerful dose of bang,
which soon operating upon their brains, they began to sing,
dance, and commit a thousand extravagancies.</p>

<p id="id04200">The noise which they made attracted the notice of the sultan, who
with his vizier was traversing the city, disguised as merchants.
Finding the doors open, they entered, and beheld the cauzee and
his companion in the height of their mirth, who welcomed them,
and they sat down. At length, after many ridiculous tricks, the
fisherman starting up, exclaimed, "I am the sultan!" "And I,"
rejoined the cauzee, "am my lord the bashaw!" "Bashaw!" continued
the fisherman, "if I choose I can strike off thy head." "I know
it," returned the cauzee, "but at present I am not worth
beheading; give me first a rich government, that I may be worth
punishing." "Thou sayest true," answered the fisherman; "I must
make thee fat before thou wilt be fit for killing."</p>

<p id="id04201">The sultan laughed at their extravagancies, and said to his
vizier, "I will amuse myself with these vagabonds to-morrow
evening:" then rising up, he and his minister departed.</p>

<p id="id04202">The next evening the cauzee and the fisherman indulged themselves
as before, and while they were making merry, the sultan and his
vizier entered, but in different disguises from those they had
worn on the former night. They brought with them a strong
confection of opium, which they presented to their hosts, who,
highly delighted, greedily devoured it, and such were the effects
that they became madder than ever. At length, the fisherman
starting up, exclaimed, "The sultan is deposed, and I am
sovereign in his stead." "Suppose the sultan should hear thee,"
replied the prince. "If he opposes me," cried the fisherman, "I
will order my bashaw to strike off his head; but I will now
punish thee for thy insolent question." He then ran up and seized
the sultan by the nose, the cauzee at the same time attacking the
vizier: it was with difficulty that they made their escape from
the house.</p>

<p id="id04203">The sultan, notwithstanding his tweak by the nose, resolved to divert
himself further with the bang-eaters, and the next evening putting on
a fresh disguise, repaired to the cauzee's house with his vizier;
where he found the happy companions in high glee. They had taken it
into their heads to dance, which they did with such vehemence, and for
so long a time, that at length they fell down with fatigue. When they
had rested a little, the fisherman perceiving the sultan, said,
"Whence comest thou?" "We are strangers," replied the sultan, "and
only reached this city to-night; but on our way through the streets,
hearing your mirth, we made bold to enter, that we might participate
it with you. Are ye not, however, fearful lest the sultan should hear
you on his rounds, and punish you for an infringement of the laws?"
"How should the sultan hear us?" answered the fisherman; "he is in his
palace, and we in our own house, though, perhaps, much merrier than
he, poor fellow, with the cares of state upon his mind,
notwithstanding his splendour."</p>

<p id="id04204">"How comes it," rejoined the sovereign, "that you have not
visited the sultan? for you are merry fellows, and I think he
would encourage you." "We fear," replied the fisherman, "his
guards would beat us away." "Never mind them," said the sultan;
"if you choose I will give you a letter of recommendation, which
I am sure he will pay attention to, for we were intimate when
youths." "Let us have it," cried the fisherman. The sultan wrote
a note, directed to himself, and departed.</p>

<p id="id04205">In the morning the cauzee and the fisherman repaired to the
palace, and delivered the note to one of the guards, who, on
sight of it, placed it on his head, prostrated himself to the
ground, and then introduced them to the sultan. Having read the
letter, the sultan commanded them to be led into separate
apartments, and to be treated respectfully. At noon a handsome
collation was served up to each, and at sunset a full service,
after which they were presented with coffee. When about two hours
of the night had passed, the sultan ordered them into his
presence, and on their making their obeisance returned their
salutes, and desired them to be seated, saying, "Where is the
person who gave you this letter?"</p>

<p id="id04206">"Mighty sultan," replied the fisherman, "two men who last night
visited our house inquired why we did not repair to your majesty,
and partake of your bounty. We replied, that we feared the guards
would drive us away; when one of them gave us this note, saying,
'Fear not; take this recommendation to the sultan, with whom in
my youth I was intimate.' We followed his direction, and have
found his words to be true. We inquired whence they came; but
they would not tell us more than that they were strangers in this
city." "It is," continued the sultan, "absolutely necessary that
you should bring them to my presence, for it is long since I have
beheld my old friends." "Permit us then to return home, where
they may possibly visit us again," said the fisherman, "and we
will oblige them to come with us." "How can you do that," replied
the sultan, "when the other evening you could not prevent your
guest escaping, though you had him by the nose?"</p>

<p id="id04207">The poor fisherman, and his companion the cauzee, were now
confounded at the discovery that it was the sultan himself who
had witnessed their intoxication and ridiculous transports. They
trembled, turned pale, and fell prostrate to the ground, crying,
"Pardon, pardon, gracious sovereign, for the offences we have
committed, and the insult which in our madness we offered to the
sacred person of your majesty."</p>

<p id="id04208">The sultan, after laughing heartily at their distress, replied,
"Your pardon is granted, for the insult was involuntary, though
deserved, as I was an impertinent intruder on your privacy; make
yourselves easy, and sit down; but you must each of you relate to
me your adventures, or some story that you have heard." The
cauzee and the fisherman, having recovered from their confusion,
obeyed the commands of the sultan, and being seated, the latter
related the following tale.</p>

<p id="id04209" style="margin-top: 4em">               Story of the Bang-eater and His Wife.</p>

<p id="id04210" style="margin-top: 3em">There lived formerly, near Bagdad, a half-witted fellow, who was
much addicted to the use of bang. Being reduced to poverty, he
was obliged to sell his stock. One day he went to the market to
dispose of a cow; but the animal being in bad order, no one would
bid for it, and after waiting till he was weary he returned
homewards. On the way he stopped to repose himself under a tree,
and tied the cow to one of the branches while he ate some bread,
and drank of an infusion of his beloved bang, which he always
carried with him. In a short time it began to operate, so as to
bereave him of the little sense he possessed, and his head was
filled with ridiculous reveries. While he was musing, a magpie
beginning to chatter from her nest in the tree, he fancied it was
a human voice, and that some woman had asked to purchase his cow:
upon which he said, "Reverend mother of Solomon, dost thou wish
to buy my cow?" The bird croaked again. "Well," replied he, "what
wilt thou give if I will sell her a bargain." The bird repeated
her croak. "Never mind," said the foolish fellow, "for though
thou hast forgotten to bring thy purse, yet, as I dare say thou
art an honest woman, and hast bidden me ten deenars, I will trust
thee with the cow, and call on Friday for the money." The bird
renewed her croaking, which he fancied to be thanks for his
confidence; so leaving the cow tied to the branch of the tree, he
returned home exulting in the good bargain he had made for the
animal.</p>

<p id="id04211">When he entered the house, his wife inquired what he had gotten
for the cow; to which he replied, that he had sold her to an
honest woman named Am Solomon, who had promised to pay him on the
next Friday ten pieces of gold. The wife was contented, and when
Friday arrived, her idiot of a husband having, as usual, taken a
dose of bang, repaired to the tree, and hearing the bird
chattering, as before, said, "Well, my good mother, hast thou
brought the gold?" The bird croaked. Supposing the imaginary
woman refused to pay him, he became angry, and threw up his
spade, which frightening the bird, it flew from the nest, and
alighted on a heap of soil at some distance. He fancied that Am
Solomon had desired him to take his money from the heap, into
which he dug with his spade, and found a brazen vessel full of
gold coin. This discovery convinced him he was right, and being,
notwithstanding his weakness, naturally honest, he only took ten
pieces; then replacing the soil, said, "May Allah requite thee
for thy punctuality, good mother!" and returned to his wife, to
whom he gave the money, informing her at the same time of the
great treasure his friend Am Solomon possessed, and where it was
concealed. The wife waited till night, when she went and brought
away the pot of gold; which her husband observing, said, "It is
dishonest to rob one who has paid us so punctually, and if thou
dost not return it to its place, I will inform the (walee)
officer of police."</p>

<p id="id04212">The wife laughed at his folly; but fearing the ill consequences
of his executing his threat, she planned a stratagem to prevent
them. Going to the market, she purchased some broiled meat and
fish ready dressed, which she brought privately home, and
concealed in the house. At night, the husband having regaled
himself with his beloved bang, retired to sleep off his
intoxication; but about midnight she strewed the provisions she
had brought at the door, and awakening her partner, cried out, in
pretended astonishment, "Dear husband, a most wonderful
phenomenon has occurred; there has been a violent storm while you
slept, and, strange to tell, it has rained pieces of broiled meat
and fish, which now lie at the door!" The husband, still in a
state of stupefaction from the bang, got up, went to the door,
and seeing the provisions, was persuaded of the truth of his
wife's story. The fish and flesh were gathered up, and he partook
with much glee of the miraculous treat; but he still threatened
to inform the walee of her having stolen the treasure of the good
old woman Am Solomon.</p>

<p id="id04213">In the morning the foolish bang-eater actually repaired to the
walee, and informed him that his wife had stolen a pot of gold,
which she had still in her possession. The walee upon this
apprehended the woman, who denied the accusation, when she was
threatened with death. She then said, "My lord, the power is in
your hands; but I am an injured woman, as you will find by
questioning my unfortunate husband; who, alas! is deranged in his
intellects. Ask him when I committed the theft." The walee did
so; to which he replied, "It was on the evening of that night on
which it rained broiled flesh and fish ready dressed." "Wretch!"
exclaimed the walee, "dost thou dare to utter falsehoods before
me? Who ever saw it rain any thing but water?" "As I hope for
life, my lord," replied the bang-eater, "I speak the truth; for
my wife and myself ate of the fish and flesh which fell from the
clouds." The woman being appealed to, denied the assertion of her
husband.</p>

<p id="id04214">The walee being now convinced that the man was crazy, released
his wife, and sent the husband to the madhouse; where he remained
some days, till the wife, pitying his condition, contrived to get
him released by the following stratagem. She visited her husband,
and desired him when any one inquired of him if he had seen it
rain flesh and fish, to answer, "No: who ever saw it rain any
thing but water?" She then informed the keeper that he was come
to his senses, and desired him to put the question. On his
answering properly he was released.</p>

<p id="id04215">The fisherman had not long been in the service of the sultan,
when walking one day near the house of a principal merchant, his
daughter chanced to look through a window, and the buffoon was so
struck with her beauty that he became devoted to love. Daily did
he repair to the same spot for weeks together in hopes of once
seeing her, but in vain; for she did not again appear at the
window. At length, his passion had such an effect upon him that
he fell sick, kept his bed, and began to rave, exclaiming, "Ah!
what charming eyes, what a beautiful complexion, what a graceful
stature has my beloved!" In this situation he was attended by an
old woman, who, compassionating his case, desired him to reveal
the cause of his uneasiness.</p>

<p id="id04216">"My dear mother," replied he, "I thank thee for thy kindness; but
unless thou canst assist me I must soon die." He then related
what he had seen, and described to her the house of the merchant.
When she said, "Son, be of good cheer; for no one could so
readily have assisted thee in this dilemma as myself. Have
patience, and I will speedily return with intelligence of thy
beloved." Having spoken thus, she departed, and upon reaching her
own house disguised herself as a devotee. Throwing over her
shoulders a coarse woollen gown, holding in one hand a long
string of beads, in the other a walking staff, she proceeded to
the merchant's house, at the gate of which she cried, "God is
God, there is no God but God; may his holy name be praised, and
may God be with you," in a most devout tone.</p>

<p id="id04217">The merchant's daughter, on hearing this devout ejaculation, came
to the door, saluted the old woman with great respect, and said,
"Dear mother, pray for me:" when she exclaimed, "May Allah
protect thee, my beloved child, from all injury!" The young lady
then introduced her into the house, seated her in the most
honourable place, and with her mother sat down by her. They
conversed on religious subjects till noon, when the old woman
called for water, performed her ablutions, and recited prayers of
an unusual length: upon which the mother and daughter remarked to
one another that the aged matron must certainly be a most
religious character. When prayers were ended, they set a
collation before her; but she declined partaking, saying, "I am
to day observing a fast." This increased their respect and
admiration of her sanctity, so that they requested her to remain
with them till sunset, and break her fast with them, to which she
consented. At sunset she prayed again, after which she ate a
little, and then uttered many pious exhortations. In short, the
mother and daughter were so pleased with her, that they invited
her to stay all night. In the morning, she rose early, made her
ablutions, prayed for a considerable time, and concluded with a
blessing upon her entertainers in learned words, which they could
not understand. When she rose up, they supported her by the arms
respectfully, and entreated her longer stay; but she declined it,
and having taken leave, departed; promising, however, with the
permission of Allah, to make them soon another visit.</p>

<p id="id04218">On the second day following, the old woman repaired again to the
merchant's house, and was joyfully received by the mother and
daughter; who, kissing her hands and feet, welcomed her return.
She behaved the same as before, and inspired them with stronger
veneration for her sandity. Her visits now grew frequent, and she
was always a welcome guest in the merchant's family. At length,
one evening she entered, and said, "I have an only daughter,
whose espousals are now celebrating, and this night the bride
goes in state to her husband's house. My desire is that my good
young lady should attend the ceremony, and receive the benefit of
my prayers." The mother replied, "I am unwilling to let her go,
lest some accident should befall her:" upon which the pretended
religious exclaimed, "What canst thou fear, while I and other
devout women shall be with her?" The daughter expressing great
eagerness to attend the nuptials, her mother at length consented.</p>

<p id="id04219">When the merchant's daughter had adorned herself in her richest
habit, she accompanied the old woman; who, after leading her
through several streets, conducted her to the lodging of the late
fisherman, but now favourite to the sultan, who was eagerly
expecting her arrival. The young lady was astonished on her
entrance at beholding a comely looking man; who, she saw, could
hardly restrain his raptures at the sight of her. Her first alarm
was great at finding herself betrayed into such a snare by the
hypocritical beldam; but having naturally much presence of mind,
she concealed her fears, and considered how she might escape. She
sat down, and after looking round the apartment affected to
laugh, saying to the gallant, "It is commonly usual when a lover
invites his mistress to his house to have an entertainment
prepared; for what is love without the accompaniment of a feast?
If you wish, therefore, that I should spend the evening here, go
and bring in some good cheer, that our joy may be complete. I
will with my good mother wait your return."</p>

<p id="id04220">The gallant, rejoiced at her commands, exclaimed, "Thou hast
spoken truly, and to hear is to obey;" after which, he went
towards the market to order a splendid entertainment. When he was
gone, the young lady locked the door after him, and thanking the
old woman for introducing her to so handsome a lover, threw her
off her guard, while she walked about the apartment meditating
her escape. At length she found in one corner of it a sharp
sabre, and drawing up her sleeve to her elbow, she grasped the
weapon, which she struck with such force at her false friend, who
was reclining on a sofa, as to cleave the head of the abandoned
procuress in two, and she fell down weltering in her blood, to
rise no more.</p>

<p id="id04221">The merchant's daughter now searched the room, and finding a rich
dress which the favourite usually wore when he visited the
sultan, rolled it up in a bundle, and carrying it under her veil,
unlocked the door, and hastened homewards. Luckily she reached
her father's house without interruption. Her mother welcomed her
with joy; but on perceiving the bundle, said, "My dear daughter,
what can have been given thee at the nuptials of a poor
religious?" The daughter, whose mind had been over agitated with
her late adventure, was not able to answer; her spirits sunk at
the recollection of her narrow escape, and she fainted away. The
mother shrieked aloud with affright, which brought in her husband
and attendants, who used various means for the young lady's
recovery; and at length, having regained her senses, she related
what had passed. The merchant having cursed the memory of the old
woman for her hypocritical deception, comforted his virtuous
daughter, and taking up the dress which he knew, and to whom it
belonged, hastened to make his complaint to the sultan.</p>

<p id="id04222">When the sultan had heard the complaint of the merchant, he was
enraged against his unworthy favourite, and commanded him to be
apprehended; but he could no where be found, for having on his
return home seen the old woman weltering in her blood, he guessed
what had happened; and apprehensive of being called to an
account, putting on a mean disguise, made his escape from the
city. Fortunately for him a caravan was just taking its
departure, and with it he travelled for five days successively,
with a mind tortured by disappointed love, and the fear of
discovery. At length the caravan passed the confines of his late
master, and encamped before a large city, which he entered, and
having hired a room at a caravanserai, he resolved to repose, and
seek out for some employment less dangerous than making love, or
serving princes.</p>

<p id="id04223">When he had rested himself for some days, he repaired to a
market, where labourers stood to be hired; and had not waited
long, when a woman coming up asked if he wanted work, to which he
replied in the affirmative. She then said, "Part of the wall
round the court of my house is so much decayed, that I must have
it taken down and rebuilt, and if thou art willing to undertake
the job I will employ thee." On his consenting, she led him to
her house, and shewing him the wall, gave him a pick-axe,
directing him as he went on to place the stones in one heap and
the rubbish in another. He replied, "To hear is to obey." She
then brought him some provision and water, when he refreshed
himself, and having thanked God that he had escaped, and was able
to get his living, began his task, which he continued till
sunset. His employer paid him ten pieces of silver for his day's
work, and he returned contented to his lodging.</p>

<p id="id04224">The following morning he again went to labour, and was treated
with the same kindness as before. About noon, as he was stocking
up the foundation of the wall he found a copper vessel, which
upon examination proved to be full of golden coin. He carried the
vessel to his lodging, where he counted the money, upwards of a
hundred deenars, and returned to his work. As he was coming home
in the evening, he saw a crowd following a man who carried upon
his head a large chest, which he offered for sale at a hundred
deenars, but refused to mention the contents.</p>

<p id="id04225">The fisherman was seized with an irresistible impulse to purchase
the chest, and having a small silver coin of not more value than
a silver penny, said to himself, "I will try my fate, possibly it
may contain something valuable; but if not, I will disregard the
disappointment;" ordered it to be conveyed to his lodging, and
paid the price demanded. He then locked his door and opened the
chest, when, to his astonishment, he beheld in it a beautiful
girl very richly dressed, but apparently lifeless. However, on
putting his hand to her mouth, he perceived that she breathed,
and was only in a deep sleep, from which he endeavoured to awake
her, but in vain. He then took her out of the chest, laid her
gently on his carpet, and continued to gaze at her charms; till
at length about midnight she awoke, and in an exclamation of
alarm and surprise exclaimed, "Gracious Allah, where am I?"</p>

<p id="id04226">When the lady's first alarm had subsided, she asked the fisherman
how he had brought her to his lodging, and on being informed of
the circumstances her mind became easy; for he behaved towards
her with respectful attention. Concealing for the present her
condition and adventures, she said, "This lodging is too mean, on
the morrow you must hire a better. Serve me with fidelity, do as
I desire, and you shall be amply rewarded." The fisherman, who,
cautioned by his last love adventure, was fearful of taking
liberties, and awed by her dignified demeanour, made a profound
obeisance, and professed himself her slave. He set before her the
best refreshments he could procure, and when she had supped left
her, and retired to sleep in a separate chamber.</p>

<p id="id04227">Early the next morning he went and hired a decent house, to which
he conveyed her in a covered litter, and did not cease to attend
upon her in all her commands for twenty days, she supplying him
with money to purchase necessaries.</p>

<p id="id04228">It is proper now to mention, that the lady bought by the
fisherman in the chest was the favourite mistress of the sultan:
having deserted for her all his other women, they had become
envious; but the sultana, who, before the arrival of Koout al
Koolloob (for such was her name) had presided over the haram, was
more mortified than the rest, and had resolved to effect her
removal. For this a favourable opportunity soon occurred, owing
to the sultan's departure for twenty days upon a hunting
excursion. In a day or two after his absence, the sultana invited
Koout al Koolloob to an entertainment, and having mixed a strong
soporific in some sherbet, presented it her to drink. The effect
of the potion was instantaneous, and she sunk into a trance; when
the sultana putting her into the chest, commanded it to be given
to a broker, and sold without examination of the contents, for a
hundred deenars; hoping, that whoever might be the purchaser, he
would be so fascinated with the charms of the beautiful Koout al
Koolloob, as to enjoy his good fortune in secrecy; and that she
should thus get rid of a rival without the crime of
assassination.</p>

<p id="id04229">When the sultan returned from his excursion, immediately on
entering the palace he inquired for his favourite; when the
sultana entering with affected sadness, said, "Alas! my lord, the
beautiful and affectionate Koout al Koolloob, unable to bear the
pangs of absence, three days after your departure fell sick, and
having lingered for seven days, was gathered to the mercy of the
Almighty." The sultan, on hearing this, burst into an agony of
grief, and exclaimed, "There is no asylum or refuge but with God;
from God we came, and to God we must return." He was overcome
with affliction, and remained the whole night involved in
melancholy. In the morning he sent for his vizier, and commanded
him to look out for a spot on the bank of the river for the
erection of a building in which he might sit retired, and
meditate on his beloved Koout al Koolloob.</p>

<p id="id04230">The vizier replied, "To hear is to obey;" and taking with him an
architect, fixed upon a pleasant spot, on which he ordered him to
mark out a space of ninety yards in length and seventy in breadth
for the intended building. The necessary materials, of stone and
marbles, were soon collected, and the work was begun upon; which
the minister for two days superintended in person. On the third
the sultan came to view the progress. He approved of the plan,
and said, "It is truly beautiful; but, alas! only worthy of the
residence of Koout al Koolloob;" after which he wept bitterly.
Seeing the distress of the sultan, his vizier said, "My lord, be
resigned under distress; for the wise have written, Be moderate
when prosperity occurs, and when calamity afflicts thee exercise
patience.'"</p>

<p id="id04231">The sultan replied, "It is true, O vizier, that resignation is
praiseworthy, and impatience blamable; for a poet has justly
said, 'Be calm under adversity; for calmness can alone extricate
from danger.' To affliction joy often succeeds, and after trouble
we generally enjoy repose; but, alas! human nature cannot divest
itself of feeling; and Koout al Koolloob was so dear to me, and
so delighted my soul, that I dread I shall never find another
mistress her equal in beauty and accomplishments." The vizier
consoled his master, and at length prevailed upon him to submit
to his misfortune with some degree of resignation.</p>

<p id="id04232">The sultan and vizier daily repaired to view the progress of the
new edifice, the report of which had spread through the city, and
at length reached Koout al Koolloob, who said to the fisherman,
"We are every day expending our money, and getting nothing:
suppose, therefore, you seek employment in the building which the
sultan is erecting. Report says that he is liberal, so that
possibly advantage may accrue." The fisherman replied, "My dear
mistress, how shall I bear the least absence from you?" for he
loved her, and she perceiving it, often dreaded that he would
have made advances; but the remembrance of what he had endured
from the conduct of the merchant's daughter had made him
cautious. She replied, "Dost thou really love me?" "Canst thou
doubt it?" answered he; "thou art my life, and the light of my
eyes!" "If so," exclaimed she, "take this necklace, and when you
think of me as you are working, look at it, and it will console
you till your return home."</p>

<p id="id04233">The fisherman obeyed the commands of Koout al Koolloob, repaired
to the spot where the edifice was erecting, and beheld the sultan
and vizier observing the workmen. The former inquired if he
wanted employment, to which he replied in the affirmative, and
was hired. He began his labour; but so much was his mind engaged
with his mistress, that every now and then, dropping his
implements, he drew out the necklace, and looking upon it heaved
a deep sigh, which the sultan observing, said to his vizier,
"This man, perchance, is more unhappy than myself; let us call
him to us, and inquire into his circumstances." The vizier
brought him to the presence, and desired him to tell honestly why
he had sighed so deeply. "Alas!" replied he, "I am absent from my
beloved, who gave me this necklace to look at whenever I might
think upon her; and my mind is so taken up with her, that I
cannot help laying down my tools, and admiring it constantly."</p>

<p id="id04234">When the sultan saw the necklace, he recollected that it was one
which he had purchased for Koout al Koolloob for a thousand
deenars. He concealed his agitation, and said, "To whom does this
necklace belong?" "To my slave," replied the labourer, "whom I
purchased for a hundred deenars." "Canst thou admit us to thy
lodging," rejoined the sultan, "that we may see her?" "I dread,"
answered the labourer, "that her modesty may be offended; but I
will consult her, and if she assents, I will invite you to my
lodging." "That is but just," said the sultan, "and no more than
what is proper."</p>

<p id="id04235">The labourer at sunset returned home, and informed Koout al
Koolloob of his adventure, when she desired him on the morrow to
purchase what was requisite for a decent entertainment, at the
same time giving him five deenars. In the morning he bought what
she had desired, and going to his work, informed the sultan and
vizier that they were welcome to his homely fare, and to see his
slave; or rather, said he, "My divinity, for as such I have at
humble distance adored her."</p>

<p id="id04236">The sultan and vizier accompanied the labourer to his house where
they were astonished to find prepared an elegant collation, of
which they partook; after which they drank sherbet and coffee.
The sultan then desired to see his slave, who just made her
appearance, but retired immediately. However, the sultan knew
her; and said to the labourer, "Wilt thou dispose of this
damsel?" "I cannot, my lord," replied the labourer, "for my soul
is wholly occupied with her love, though as yet unreturned." "May
thy love be rewarded!" exclaimed the sultan; "but bring her with
thee at sunset to the palace." "To hear is to obey," replied the
labourer.</p>

<p id="id04237">At sunset the labourer conducted his slave to the palace, when
the eunuchs attended, and would have led her into the haram; but
he clung round her, and exclaimed, "She is my beloved, and I
cannot part with her." Upon this the sultan related the
circumstances of his having lost her; and requested him to give
her up. Knowing that he durst not oppose the sovereign, he
submitted to his commands with resignation, when the sultan
presented him with fifteen hundred deenars, and a beautiful
slave, also a rich dress, at the same time receiving him among
the most distinguished of his officers. So well did he conduct
himself in his new station, that in a short time he was promoted
to the rank of prime minister, and fulfilled the duties of it
with such ability and integrity, that he became celebrated by the
title of the Just Vizier.</p>

<p id="id04238">Such was the celebrity of the vizier's decisions, that in a short
time appeals were made from the most distant provinces to his
judgment. One of the most remarkable cases was the following. Two
women belonging to one man conceived on the same day, and were
delivered, one of a boy, the other of a girl, at the same time,
and in one apartment. The female infant died, when each laid
claim to the male child. The magistrates, unable to decide
between the mothers, referred the decision to the just vizier;
who, on hearing the circumstances, commanded two eggs to be
brought, and the contents to be drawn out without breaking the
shells; after which he ordered them to be filled with milk from
the breast of each woman. This being done, he placed the shells
in separate scales, and finding one outweigh the other, declared
that she whose milk was heaviest must be the mother of the male
child; but the other woman was not satisfied with this decision,
and still affirmed she was the mother of the boy.</p>

<p id="id04239">The vizier, vexed at her obstinacy, now commanded the infant to
be cut in two; when she, whom he had said was the mother, fell
into agonies, and besought its life; but the other was unmoved,
and assented to the death of the child. He then ordered her to be
severely punished, and committed the boy to its afflicted mother.
On being asked on what proofs he had grounded his decision, he
replied, "On two: the first, because the milk of a woman having
produced a male child is always heavier than that of the mother
of a female infant: the second, because the pretended mother
consented to the boy's death; and I supposed it impossible for a
woman to agree to the destruction of her offspring, which is a
part of herself."</p>
