</div>
<p>Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?</p>
<p>Name, age, race, creed.</p>
<p>What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Leopold Bloom<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ellpodbomool<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Molldopeloob<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bollopedoom<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Old Ollebo, M. P.<br>
</div>
<p>What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Poets oft have sung in rhyme<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Of music sweet their praise divine.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Let them hymn it nine times nine.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Dearer far than song or wine.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You are mine.

</div>
<p>What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled <i>If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now</i>, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime <i>Sinbad the Sailor</i> (produced by R Shelton 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?</p>
<p>Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from <i>Everybody's Book of Jokes</i> (1000 pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.</p>
<p>What relation existed between their ages?</p>
<p>16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.</p>
<p>What events might nullify these calculations?</p>
<p>The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.</p>
<p>How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?</p>
<p>Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.</p>
<p>Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?</p>
<p>Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.</p>
<p>Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?</p>
<p>Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.</p>
<p>Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?</p>
<p>He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.</p>
<p>Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?</p>
<p>Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.</p>
<p>What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?</p>
<p>The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.</p>
<p>Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?</p>
<p>The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's <i>Physical Strength and How to Obtain It</i> which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.</p>
<p>Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?</p>
<p>Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>Did either openly allude to their racial difference?</p>
<p>Neither.</p>
<p>What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?</p>
<p>He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.</p>
<p>What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?</p>
<p>Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).</p>
<p>Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?</p>
<p>Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.</p>
<p>Did they find their educational careers similar?</p>
<p>Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.</p>
<p>Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?</p>
<p>Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.</p>
<p>What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p>
<p>The scientific. The artistic.</p>
<p>What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?</p>
<p>Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.</p>
<p>Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?</p>
<p>Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.</p>
<p>What also stimulated him in his cogitations?</p>
<p>The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George's street, south, the latter at his 6 1/2d shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.</p>
<p>Such as?</p>
<p>K. II. Kino's 11/- Trousers. House of Keys. Alexander J. Keyes.</p>
<p>Such as not?</p>
<p>Look at this long candle. Calculate when it burns out and you receive gratis 1 pair of our special non-compo boots, guaranteed 1 candle power. Address: Barclay and Cook, 18 Talbot street.</p>
<p>Bacilikil (Insect Powder). Veribest (Boot Blacking). Uwantit (Combined pocket twoblade penknife with corkscrew, nailfile and pipecleaner).</p>
<p>Such as never?</p>
<p>What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?</p>
<p>Incomplete.</p>
<p>With it an abode of bliss.</p>
<p>Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in 4 oz pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree in a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat. Plamtroo.</p>
<p>Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?</p>
<p>His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.</p>
<p>What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?</p>
<p>Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's Hotel, Queen's Hotel, Queen's Hotel. Queen's Ho...</p>
<p>What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?</p>
<p>The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to I of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.</p>
<p>Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?</p>
<p>Coincidence.</p>
<p>Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?</p>
<p>He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.</p>
<p>Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as <i>A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums</i>?</p>
<p>It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. <i>My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time</i>) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's <i>Studies in Blue</i>, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.</p>
<p>Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?</p>
<p>What to do with our wives.</p>
<p>What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?</p>
<p>Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.</p>
<p>What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?</p>
<p>In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), <i>alias</i> (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).</p>
<p>What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?</p>
<p>The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.</p>
<p>How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?</p>
<p>Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse.</p>
<p>With what success had he attempted direct instruction?</p>
<p>She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.</p>
<p>What system had proved more effective?</p>
<p>Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.</p>
<p>Example?</p>
<p>She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.</p>
<p>Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?</p>
<p>Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of <i>More Nebukim</i> (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).</p>
<p>What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?</p>
<p>That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.</p>
<p>Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?</p>
<p>Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).</p>
<p>What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?</p>
<p>By Stephen: <i>suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin</i> (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).</p>
<p>By Bloom: <i>Kkifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch</i> (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).</p>
<p>How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?</p>
<p>By juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled <i>Sweets of Sin</i> (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.</p>
<p>Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?</p>
<p>Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.</p>
<p>What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?</p>
<p>The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.</p>
<p>What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreducible consummation?</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Kolod balejwaw pnimah<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.</i>
</div>
<p>Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?</p>
<p>In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.</p>
<p>How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?</p>
<p>By a periphrastic version of the general text.</p>
<p>In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?</p>
<p>The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic). Did the guest comply with his host's request?</p>
<p>Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.</p>
<p>What was Stephen's auditive sensation?</p>
<p>He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.</p>
<p>What was Bloom's visual sensation?</p>
<p>He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.</p>
<p>What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?</p>
<p>Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair. Auditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.</p>
<p>What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?</p>
<p>In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian Osmond Tearle (died 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?</p>
<p>Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.</p>
<p>Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Went out for to play ball.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He broke the jew's windows all.</i>
</div>
<p>How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?</p>
<p>With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.</p>
<p>Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Then out there came the jew's daughter<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And she all dressed in green.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And play your ball again."<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I can't come back and I won't come back<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Without my schoolfellows all.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For if my master he did hear<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He'd make it a sorry ball."<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She took him by the lilywhite hand<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And led him along the hall<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Until she led him to a room<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Where none could hear him call.<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She took a penknife out of her pocket<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And cut off his little head.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And now he'll play his ball no more<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For he lies among the dead.</i>
</div>
<p>How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?</p>
<p>With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter, all dressed in green.</p>
<p>Condense Stephen's commentary.</p>
<p>One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.</p>
<p>Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?</p>
<p>He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.</p>
<p>Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?</p>
<p>In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.</p>
<p>Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?</p>
<p>He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.</p>
<p>From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?</p>
<p>From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.</p>
<p>Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?</p>
<p>Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.</p>
<p>What other infantile memories had he of her?</p>
<p>15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.</p>
<p>What endemic characteristics were present?</p>
<p>Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.</p>
<p>What memories had he of her adolescence?</p>
<p>She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).</p>
<p>Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?</p>
<p>Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.</p>
<p>What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?</p>
<p>A temporary departure of his cat.</p>
<p>Why similarly, why differently?</p>
<p>Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male</p>
<p>(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.</p>
<p>In other respects were their differences similar?</p>
<p>In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.</p>
<p>As?</p>
<p>Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).</p>
<p>Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.</p>
<p>In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, (2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?</p>
<p>As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, <i>videlicet</i>, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.</p>
<p>In what manners did she reciprocate?</p>
<p>She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.</p>
<p>What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?</p>
<p>To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.</p>
<p>What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?</p>
<p>For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.</p>
<p>Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?</p>
<p>Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.</p>
<p>To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?</p>
<p>If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.</p>
<p>What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?</p>
<p>A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).</p>
<p>Was the proposal of asylum accepted?</p>
<p>Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined. What exchange of money took place between host and guest?</p>
<p>The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.</p>
<p>What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?</p>
<p>To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).</p>
<p>What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?</p>
<p>The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it m payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.</p>
<p>Was the clown Bloom's son?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Had Bloom's coin returned?</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?</p>
<p>Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity. He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?</p>
<p>There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.</p>
<p>Why did he desist from speculation?</p>
<p>Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.</p>
<p>Did Stephen participate in his dejection?</p>
<p>He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.</p>
<p>Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?</p>
<p>Not verbally. Substantially.</p>
<p>What comforted his misapprehension?</p>
<p>That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.</p>
<p>In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?</p>
<p>Lighted Candle in Stick borne by</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by</p>
<p>STEPHEN:</p>
<p>With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?</p>
<p>The 113th, <i>modus peregrinus: In exitu Israel de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro</i>.</p>
<p>What did each do at the door of egress?</p>
<p>Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.</p>
<p>For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?</p>
<p>For a cat.</p>
<p>What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?</p>
<p>The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.</p>
<p>With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?</p>
<p>Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.</p>
<p>Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?</p>
<p>Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.</p>
<p>Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?</p>
<p>Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.</p>
<p>Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?</p>
<p>Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.</p>
