<p class="c3">(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(With a sour tenderish smile)</i> A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(Screams gaily)</i> O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!</p>
<p>BLOOM: For old sake' sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. <i>(Gloomily)</i> 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. <i>(She puts out her hand inquisitively)</i> What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Seizes her wrist with his free hand)</i> Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuffbox?</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand)</i> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Meaningfully dropping his voice)</i> I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(Gushingly)</i> Tremendously teapot! London's teapot and I'm simply teapot all over me! <i>(She rubs sides with him)</i> After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently)</i> The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. <i>(Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring) L&#224; ci darem la mano.</i></p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly) Voglio e non.</i> You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.</p>
<p>BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. <i>(His clenched fist at his brow)</i> Think what it means. All you meant to me then. <i>(Hoarsely)</i> Woman, it's breaking me!</p>
<p class="c3">(Denis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich-boards, shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)</p>
<p>ALF BERGAN: <i>(Points jeering at the sandwichboards)</i> U. p: Up.</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(To Bloom)</i> High jinks below stairs. <i>(She gives him the glad eye)</i> Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Shocked)</i> Molly's best friend! Could you?</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss)</i> Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Offhandedly)</i> Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at <i>Leah.</i> Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pigs' feet. Feel.</p>
<p class="c3">(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He opens it and shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)</p>
<p>RICHIE: Best value in Dub.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)</p>
<p>PAT: <i>(Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy)</i> Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.</p>
<p>RICHIE: Goodgod. Inev erate inall...</p>
<p class="c3">(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)</p>
<p>RICHIE: <i>(With a cry of pain, his hand to his back)</i> Ah! Bright's! Lights!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Ooints to the navvy)</i> A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and bull story.</p>
<p>BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(All agog)</i> O, not for worlds.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Let's walk on. Shall us?</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: Let's.</p>
<p class="c3">(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)</p>
<p>THE BAWD: Jewman's melt!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat)</i> Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil)</i> Leopardstown.</p>
<p>BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!</p>
<p>BLOOM: Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(Squeezes his arm, simpers)</i> Naughty cruel I was!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly)</i> And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was...</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: Too...</p>
<p>BLOOM: Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...</p>
<p>MRS BREEN: <i>(Eagerly)</i> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p class="c3">(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)</p>
<p>THE GAFFER: <i>(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout)</i> And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.</p>
<p>THE LOITERERS: <i>(Guffaw with cleft palates)</i> O jays!</p>
<p class="c3">(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.</p>
<p>THE LOITERERS: Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)</p>
<p>THE WHORES:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Are you going far, queer fellow?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; How's your middle leg?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Got a match on you?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.<br>
</div>
<p class="c3">(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)</p>
<p>THE NAVVY: <i>(Belching)</i> Where's the bloody house?</p>
<p>THE SHEBEENKEEPER: Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.</p>
<p>THE NAVVY: <i>(Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them)</i> Come on, you British army!</p>
<p>PRIVATE CARR: <i>(Behind his back)</i> He aint half balmy.</p>
<p>PRIVATE COMPTON: <i>(Laughs)</i> What ho!</p>
<p>PRIVATE CARR: <i>(To the navvy)</i> Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.</p>
<p>THE NAVVY: <i>(Shouts)</i></p>
<p>We are the boys. Of Wexford.</p>
<p>PRIVATE COMPTON: Say! What price the sergeantmajor?</p>
<p>PRIVATE CARR: Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.</p>
<p>THE NAVVY: <i>(Shouts)</i></p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The galling chain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And free our native land.<br>
</div>
<p class="c3">(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting)</p>
<p>BLOOM: Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.</p>
<p><i>(He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend</i> Wet Dream <i>and a phallic design.</i>) Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? <i>(Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)</i></p>
<p>THE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.</p>
<p>BLOOM: My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. <i>(The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.)</i> Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like <i>rencontres.</i> Stinks like a polecat. <i>Chacun son gout</i>. He might be mad. Dogdays. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Fido! Good fellow! Garryowen! <i>(The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.)</i> Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. <i>(Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.)</i> Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.</p>
<p class="c3">(With regret he lets the unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)</p>
<p>THE WATCH: Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.</p>
<p class="c3">(Each lays hand on Bloom's shoulder.)</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Stammers)</i> I am doing good to others.</p>
<p class="c3">(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)</p>
<p>THE GULLS: Kaw kave kankury kake.</p>
<p>BLOOM: The friend of man. Trained by kindness.</p>
<p class="c3">(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high barstool, sways over the munching spaniel.)</p>
<p>BOB DORAN: Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.</p>
<p class="c3">(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig's knuckle between his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran fills silently into an area.)</p>
<p>SECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Enthusiastically)</i> A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.</p>
<p class="c3">(Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paperhoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging boarhound.)</p>
<p>SIGNOR MAFFEI: <i>(With a sinister smile)</i> Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even <i>Leo ferox</i> there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. <i>(He glares)</i> I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. <i>(With a bewitching smile)</i> I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: Come. Name and address.</p>
<p>BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! <i>(He takes off his high grade hat, saluting)</i> Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. <i>Donnerwetter!</i> Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: Proof.</p>
<p class="c3">(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it)</i> Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: <i>(Reads)</i> Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Unlawfully watching and besetting.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCH: An alibi. You are cautioned.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower)</i> This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. <i>(Plausibly)</i> You know that old joke, rose of Castile. Bloom. The change of name. Virag. <i>(He murmurs privately and confidentially)</i> We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. <i>(He shoulders the second watch gently)</i> Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. <i>(He turns gravely to the first watch)</i> Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. <i>(To the second watch gaily)</i> I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in the shake of a lamb's tail.</p>
<p class="c3">(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)</p>
<p>THE DARK MERCURY: The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.</p>
<p>MARTHA: <i>(Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the</i> Irish Times <i>in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing)</i> Henry! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: <i>(Sternly)</i> Come to the station.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft)</i> No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.</p>
<p>MARTHA: <i>(Sobbing behind her veil)</i> Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Behind his hand)</i> She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. <i>(He murmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim)</i> Shitbroleeth.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCH: <i>(Tears in his eyes, to Bloom)</i> You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: Regiment.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Turns to the gallery)</i> The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.</p>
<p>A VOICE: Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(His hand on the shoulder of the first watch)</i> My old dad too was a J. P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. <i>(With quiet feeling)</i> Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: Profession or trade.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...</p>
<p class="c3">(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)</p>
<p>MYLES CRAWFORD: <i>(His cock's wattles wagging)</i> Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. <i>Freeman's Urinal</i> and <i>Weekly Arsewipe</i> here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?</p>
<p><i>(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He carries a large portfolio labelled</i> Matcham's Masterstrokes.)</p>
<p>BEAUFOY: <i>(Drawls)</i> No, you aren't. Not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it that's all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a litterateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum)</i> That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...</p>
<p>BEAUFOY: <i>(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court)</i> You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Indistinctly)</i> University of life. Bad art.</p>
<p>BEAUFOY: <i>(Shouts)</i> It's a damnably foul lie, showing the moral rottenness of the man! <i>(He extends his portfolio)</i> We have here damning evidence, the <i>corpus delicti</i>, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.</p>
<p>A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:</p>
<p>Moses, Moses, king of the jews, Wiped his arse in the Daily News.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Bravely)</i> Overdrawn.</p>
<p>BEAUFOY: You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! <i>(To the court)</i> Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society! The archconspirator of the age!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(To the court)</i> And he, a bachelor, how...</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.</p>
<p>THE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!</p>
<p class="c3">(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)</p>
<p>SECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?</p>
<p>MARY DRISCOLL: <i>(Indignantly)</i> I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?</p>
<p>MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly)</i> I treated you white. I gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.</p>
<p>MARY DRISCOLL: <i>(Excitedly)</i> As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?</p>
<p>MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twict with my clothing.</p>
<p>BLOOM: She counterassaulted.</p>
<p>MARY DRISCOLL: <i>(Scornfully)</i> I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: keep it quiet.</p>
<p class="c3">(General laughter.)</p>
<p>GEORGE FOTTRELL: <i>(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly)</i> Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever...</p>
<p class="c3">(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)</p>
<p>LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND: <i>(Without looking up from their notebooks)</i> Loosen his boots.</p>
<p>PROFESSOR MACHUGH: <i>(From the presstable, coughs and calls)</i> Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.</p>
<p><i>(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A large bucket. Bloom himself. Bowel trouble. In Beaver street Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterer's bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely.</i> A Titbits <i>back number</i>.)</p>
<p class="c3">(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of stickingplaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)</p>
<p>J. J. O'MOLLOY: <i>(In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest)</i> This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. <i>Prima facie</i>, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold&#8212;one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.</p>

<p>J. J. O'MOLLOY: <i>(Hotly to the populace)</i> This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically, without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. <i>(Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.)</i> I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. <i>(To Bloom)</i> I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.</p>

<p>MRS YELVERTON BARRY: <i>(In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair)</i> Arrest him, constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the <i>Theatre Royal</i> at a command performance of <i>La Cigale</i>. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled <i>The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays</i>.</p>
<p>MRS BELLINGHAM: <i>(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff)</i> Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was ablossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.</p>

<p>MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me (stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me) to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: <i>(In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly)</i> Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob <i>Centaur.</i> This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude se&#241;orita, frail and lovely (his wife, as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.</p>

<p>MRS BELLINGHAM: <i>(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively)</i> Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o'-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.</p>

A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, his lordship the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor, His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends.

Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaters reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears, bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite horse with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden headstall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals.
