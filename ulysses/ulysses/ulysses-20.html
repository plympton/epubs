<p>THE YEWS: <i>(Mingling their boughs)</i> Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.</p>
<p>JOHN WYSE NOLAN: <i>(In the background, in Irish National Forester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat)</i> Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!</p>
<p>THE YEWS: <i>(Murmuring)</i> Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Scared)</i> High School of Poula? Mnemo? Not in full possession of faculties. Concussion. Run over by tram.</p>
<p>THE ECHO: Sham!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with badge)</i> I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes, instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice), even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.</p>
<p class="c3">(Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)</p>
<p>THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray! <i>(They cheer)</i></p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent snowballs, struggles to rise)</i> Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague street. <i>(He cheers feebly)</i> Hurray for the High School!</p>
<p>THE ECHO: Fool!</p>
<p>THE YEWS: <i>(Rustling)</i> She is right, our sister. Whisper. <i>(Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom.)</i> Who profaned our silent shade?</p>
<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(Coyly, through parting fingers)</i> There? In the open air?</p>
<p>THE YEWS: <i>(Sweeping downward)</i> Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.</p>
<p>THE WATERFALL:</p>

</div>
<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(With wide fingers)</i> O, infamy!</p>
<p>BLOOM: I was precocious. Youth. The fauna. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains with poor papa's operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?</p>
<p class="c3">(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)</p>
<p>STAGGERING BOB: (LARGE TEARDROPS ROLLING FROM HIS PROMINENT EYES, SNIVELS) Me. Me see.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I... <i>(With pathos)</i> No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play...</p>
<p class="c3">(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)</p>
<p>THE NANNYGOAT: <i>(Bleats)</i> Megeggaggegg! Nannannanny!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and gorsespine)</i> Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. <i>(He gazes intently downwards on the water)</i> Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. <i>(Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls roteatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple waiting waters.)</i></p>
<p>THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!</p>
<p><i>(Far out in the bay between bailey and kish lights the</i> Erin's King <i>sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)</i></p>
<p>COUNCILLOR NANNETII: <i>(Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellowkitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims)</i> When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let my epitaph be written. I have...</p>
<p>BLOOM: Done. Prff!</p>
<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(Loftily)</i> We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. <i>(She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth)</i> Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you...?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Pawing the heather abjectly)</i> O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.</p>
<p>THE NYMPH: In my presence. The powderpuff. <i>(She blushes and makes a knee)</i> And the rest!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Dejected)</i> Yes. <i>Peccavi!</i> I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. <i>(With sudden fervour)</i> For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...?</p>
<p class="c3">(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing)</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF KITTY: <i>(In the thicket)</i> Show us one of them cushions.</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.</p>
<p class="c3">(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF LYNCH: <i>(In the thicket)</i> Whew! Piping hot!</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF ZOE: <i>(From the thicket)</i> Came from a hot place.</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF VIRAG: <i>(A birdchief, bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns)</i> Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!</p>
<p>BLOOM: It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.</p>
<p>THE WATERFALL:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Phillaphulla Poulaphouca<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.</i>
</div>
<p>THE YEWS: Ssh! Sister, speak!</p>
<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and hugewinged wimple, softly, with remote eyes)</i> Tranquilla convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. <i>(She reclines her head, sighing)</i> Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom half rises. His back trouserbutton snaps.)</p>
<p>THE BUTTON: Bip!</p>
<p class="c3">(Two sluts of the coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)</p>
<p>THE SLUTS:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He didn't know what to do,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To keep it up,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To keep it up.<br>
</div>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Coldly)</i> You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing like an ass pissing.</p>
<p>THE YEWS: <i>(Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms aging and swaying)</i> Deciduously!</p>
<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her habit)</i> Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! <i>(A large moist stain appears on her robe)</i> Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. <i>(She clutches again in her robe)</i> Wait. Satan, you'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. <i>(She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins)</i> Nekum!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Starts up, seizes her hand)</i> Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat o' nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruningknife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do you lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? <i>(He clutches her veil)</i> A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?</p>
<p>THE NYMPH: <i>(With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks)</i> Poli...!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Calls after her)</i> As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our studfee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read. <i>(The fleeing nymph raises a keen)</i> Eh? I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. <i>(He sniffs)</i> Rut. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.</p>
<p class="c3">(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)</p>
<p>BELLA: You'll know me the next time.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Composed, regards her) Pass&#233;e.</i> Mutton dressed as lamb. Long in the tooth and superfluous hair. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.</p>
<p>BELLA: <i>(Contemptuously)</i> You're not game, in fact. <i>(Her sowcunt barks)</i> Fbhracht!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Contemptuously)</i> Clean your nailless middle finger first, your bully's cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.</p>
<p>BELLA: I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!</p>
<p>BLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!</p>
<p>BELLA: <i>(Turns to the piano)</i> Which of you was playing the dead march from <i>Saul?</i></p>
<p>ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. <i>(She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms)</i> The cat's ramble through the slag. <i>(She glances back)</i> Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? <i>(She darts back to the table)</i> What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.</p>
<p class="c3">(Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Gently)</i> Give me back that potato, will you?</p>
<p>ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(With feeling)</i> It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor mamma.</p>
<p>ZOE:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Give a thing and take it back<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; God'll ask you where is that<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You'll say you don't know<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; God'll send you down below.<br>
</div>
<p>BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.</p>
<p>ZOE: Here. <i>(She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh, and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking)</i> Those that hides knows where to find.</p>
<p>BELLA: <i>(Frowns)</i> Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?</p>
<p class="c3">(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(With exaggerated politeness)</i> This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. <i>(He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom)</i> We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. <i>Dans ce bordel ou tenons nostre &#233;tat</i>.</p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(Calls from the hearth)</i> Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Hands Bella a coin)</i> Gold. She has it.</p>
<p>BELLA: <i>(Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty)</i> Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Delightedly)</i> A hundred thousand apologies. <i>(He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns)</i> Permit, <i>brevi manu</i>, my sight is somewhat troubled.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bends over the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)</p>
<p>FLORRY: <i>(Strives heavily to rise)</i> Ow! My foot's asleep. <i>(She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)</i></p>
<p>BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: <i>(Chattering and squabbling)</i> The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three... allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate... who's touching it?... ow! ... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time?... who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentleman paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence)</i> No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle!</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking)</i> Hard earned on the flat of my back.</p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(Lifting Kitty from the table)</i> Come!</p>
<p>KITTY: Wait. <i>(She clutches the two crowns)</i></p>
<p>FLORRY: And me?</p>
<p>LYNCH: Hoopla! <i>(He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)</i></p>
<p>STEPHEN:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The fox crew, the cocks flew,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The bells in heaven<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Were striking eleven.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 'Tis time for her poor soul<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To get out of heaven.<br>
</div>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between bella and florry)</i> So. Allow me. <i>(He takes up the poundnote)</i> Three times ten. We're square.</p>
<p>BELLA: <i>(Admiringly)</i> You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Points)</i> Him? Deep as a drawwell. <i>(Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)</i></p>
<p>BLOOM: This is yours.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: How is that? <i>Les distrait</i> or absentminded beggar. <i>(He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object fills.)</i> That fell.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches)</i> This.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: Lucifer. Thanks.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Quietly)</i> You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Hands him all his coins)</i> Be just before you are generous.</p>
<p>BLOOM: I will but is it wise? <i>(He counts)</i> One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. <i>(He laughs loudly)</i> Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.</p>
<p>BLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: Doesn't matter a rambling damn.</p>
<p>BLOOM: No, but...</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Comes to the table)</i> Cigarette, please. <i>(Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table)</i> And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. <i>(A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it)</i> Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. <i>(He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy)</i></p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(Watching him)</i> You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Brings the match near his eye)</i> Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. <i>(He draws the match away. It goes out.)</i> Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. <i>(He frowns mysteriously)</i> Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has twobacks at midnight. Married.</p>
<p>ZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.</p>
<p>FLORRY: <i>(Nods)</i> Mr Lambe from London.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.</p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply) Dona nobis pacem.</i></p>
<p class="c3">(The cigarette slips from Stephen 's fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it in the grate.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. <i>(To Zoe)</i> You have nothing?</p>
<p>ZOE: Is he hungry?</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the</i> Dusk of the Gods)</p>

<p>ZOE: <i>(Tragically)</i> Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! <i>(She takes his hand)</i> Blue eyes beauty I'll read your hand. <i>(She points to his forehead)</i> No wit, no wrinkles. <i>(She counts)</i> Two, three, Mars, that's courage. <i>(Stephen shakes his head)</i> No kid.</p>
<p>LYNCH: Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. <i>(To Zoe)</i> Who taught you palmistry?</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Turns)</i> Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. <i>(To Stephen)</i> I see it in your face. The eye, like that. <i>(She frowns with lowered head)</i></p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice)</i> Like that. Pandybat.</p>
<p class="c3">(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)</p>
<p>FATHER DOLAN: Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.</p>
<p class="c3">(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)</p>
<p>DON JOHN CONMEE: Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy!</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Examining Stephen's palm)</i> Woman's hand.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Murmurs)</i> Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.</p>
<p>ZOE: What day were you born?</p>
<p>STEPHEN: Thursday. Today.</p>
<p>ZOE: Thursday's child has far to go. <i>(She traces lines on his hand)</i> Line of fate. Influential friends.</p>
<p>FLORRY: <i>(Pointing)</i> Imagination.</p>
<p>ZOE: Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... <i>(She peers at his hands abruptly)</i> I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Detaches her fingers and offers his palm)</i> More harm than good. Here. Read mine.</p>
<p>BELLA: Show. <i>(She turns up bloom's hand)</i> I thought so. Knobby knuckles for the women.</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Peering at bloom's palm)</i> Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Wrong.</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Quickly)</i> O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?</p>
<p class="c3">(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)</p>
<p>BLACK LIZ: Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.</p>
<p class="c3">(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off)</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Points to his hand)</i> That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twentytwo years ago. I was sixteen.</p>
<p>ZOE: I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: See? Moves to one great goal. I am twentytwo. Sixteen years ago he was twentytwo too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled. Twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. <i>(He winces)</i> Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?</p>
<p class="c3">(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)</p>
<p>FLORRY: What?</p>
<p class="c3">(A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)</p>
<p>THE BOOTS: <i>(Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers)</i> Haw haw have you the horn?</p>
<p class="c3">(Bronze by gold they whisper.)</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(To Florry)</i> Whisper.</p>
<p class="c3">(They whisper again)</p>
<p class="c3">(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan in yachtsman's cap and white shoes officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan's coat shoulder.)</p>
<p>LENEHAN: Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?</p>
<p>BOYLAN: <i>(Seated, smiles)</i> Plucking a turkey.</p>
<p>LENEHAN: A good night's work.</p>
<p>BOYLAN: <i>(Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks)</i> Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. <i>(He holds out a forefinger)</i> Smell that.</p>

<p>ZOE AND FLORRY: <i>(Laugh together)</i> Ha ha ha ha.</p>

<p>BLOOM: <i>(In flunkey's prune plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig)</i> I'm afraid not, sir. The last articles...</p>
<p>BOYLAN: <i>(Tosses him sixpence)</i> Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. <i>(He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head)</i> Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife, you understand?</p>
<p>BLOOM: Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.</p>
<p>MARION: He ought to feel himself highly honoured. <i>(She plops splashing out of the water)</i> Raoul darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.</p>
<p>BOYLAN: <i>(A merry twinkle in his eye)</i> Topping!</p>
<p>BELLA: What? What is it?</p>
<p class="c3">(Zoe whispers to her.)</p>
<p>MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.</p>
<p>BOYLAN: (clasps himself) Here, I can't hold this little lot much longer. (he strides off on stiff cavalry legs)</p>
<p>BELLA: <i>(Laughing)</i> Ho ho ho ho.</p>
<p>BOYLAN: <i>(To Bloom, over his shoulder)</i> You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Thank you, sir. I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? <i>(He holds out an ointment jar)</i> Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower...? Lukewarm water...?</p>
<p>KITTY: <i>(From the sofa)</i> Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.</p>
<p class="c3">(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur, liplapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)</p>
<p>MINA KENNEDY: <i>(Her eyes upturned)</i> O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!</p>
<p>LYDIA DOUCE: <i>(Her mouth opening)</i> Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cockhorse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.</p>
<p>KITTY: <i>(Laughing)</i> Hee hee hee.</p>
<p>BOYLAN'S VOICE: <i>(Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach)</i> Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!</p>
<p>MARION'S VOICE: <i>(Hoarsely, sweetly, rising to her throat)</i> O! Weeshwashtkissinapooisthnapoohuck?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself)</i> Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!</p>
<p>BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY, KITTY: Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!</p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(Points)</i> The mirror up to nature. <i>(He laughs)</i> Hu hu hu hu hu!</p>
<p class="c3">(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE: <i>(In dignified ventriloquy)</i> 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. <i>(To Bloom)</i> Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. <i>(He crows with a black capon's laugh)</i> Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymornun. Iagogogo!</p>

<p class="c3">(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunney's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, large eights. She holds a Scottish widows' insurance policy and a large marquee umbrella under which her brood run with her, Patsy hopping on one shod foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cod's mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)</p>

<p class="c3">(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox, drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, brighteyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrbling to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, hayforks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, greynegroes waving torches. The crowd bawls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)</p>

Skeleton horses, Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminster's Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beaufort's Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rustyarmoured, leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain on a brokenwinded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockeystick at the ready.

<p class="c3">(She drops two pennies in the slot. Gold, pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the pianostool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsel's grace, his bowknot bobbing)</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Twirls round herself, heeltapping)</i> Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance? Clear the table.</p>
<p><i>(The pianola with changing lights plays in waltz time the prelude of</i> My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. <i>Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe round the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, arming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her round the room. Bloom stands aside. Her sleeve filling from gracing arms reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Between the curtains Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a gorget of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief, tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is an immense dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand lightly on his breastbone, bows, and fondles his flower and buttons.)</i></p>
<p>MAGINNI: The poetry of motion, art of calisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levenston's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner step. So. Watch me!

<p>Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind...</p>
<p class="c3">(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slimsandalled, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing, linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)</p>
<p>MAGINNI: <i>(Clipclaps glovesilent hands) Carr&#233;! Avant deux!</i> Breathe evenly! <i>Balance!</i></p>
<p class="c3">(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing visavis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)</p>

<p>My little shy little lass has a waist.</p>
<p class="c3">(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)</p>
<p>MAGINNI: <i>Avant huit! Travers&#233;! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois&#233;!</i></p>
<p class="c3">(The night hours, one by one, steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary they curchycurchy under veils.)</p>
