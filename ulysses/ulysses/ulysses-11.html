<p>&#8212;You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.</p>
<p>Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.</p>
<p>Yes, bronze from anearby.</p>
<p>&#8212;... <i>Sweetheart, goodbye!</i></p>
<p>&#8212;I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.</p>
<p>He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.</p>
<p>&#8212;Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.</p>
<p>Tom Rochford...</p>
<p>&#8212;Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.</p>
<p>Lenehan gulped to go.</p>
<p>&#8212;Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.</p>
<p>He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.</p>
<p>&#8212;How do you do, Mr Dollard?</p>
<p>&#8212;Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.</p>
<p>Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.</p>
<p>Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.</p>
<p>He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.</p>
<p>Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.</p>
<p>Jingle a tinkle jaunted.</p>
<p>Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle. Hear.</p>
<p>&#8212;Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.</p>
<p>Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, <i>eau de Nil.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.</p>
<p>There was.</p>
<p>&#8212;A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.</p>
<p>&#8212;God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.</p>
<p>They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.</p>
<p>&#8212;Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's my pipe, by the way?</p>
<p>He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8212;I saved the situation, Ben, I think.</p>
<p>&#8212;You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.</p>
<p>Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.</p>
<p>&#8212;I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.</p>
<p>&#8212;By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.</p>
<p>&#8212;Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.</p>
<p>Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.</p>
<p>Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.</p>
<p>Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...</p>
<p>&#8212;Tweedy.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes. Is she alive?</p>
<p>&#8212;And kicking.</p>
<p>&#8212;She was a daughter of...</p>
<p>&#8212;Daughter of the regiment.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after</p>
<p>&#8212;Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?</p>
<p>Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.</p>
<p>&#8212;Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish Molly, O.</p>
<p>He puffed a pungent plumy blast.</p>
<p>&#8212;From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.</p>
<p>They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.</p>
<p>Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.</p>
<p>Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.</p>
<p>By Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.</p>
<p>Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>When love absorbs my ardent soul</i>...</p>
<p>Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.</p>
<p>&#8212;War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.</p>
<p>&#8212;So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or money.</p>
<p>He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.</p>
<p>&#8212;Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.</p>
<p>In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.</p>
<p>&#8212;Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben. <i>Amoroso ma non troppo.</i> Let me there.</p>
<p>Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread <i>Independent,</i> searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8212;............ <i>my ardent soul</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>I care not foror the morrow.</i>
</div>
<p>In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is. Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.</p>
<p>Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.</p>
<p>&#8212;Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.</p>
<p>George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.</p>
<p>Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.</p>
<p>Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.</p>
<p>Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.</p>
<p>Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.</p>
<p>Strongly.</p>
<p>&#8212;Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>M'appari,</i> Simon, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p>Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: <i>A Last Farewell.</i> A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.</p>
<p>Cowley sang:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>&#8212;M'appari tutt'amor:<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Il mio sguardo l'incontr...</i>
</div>
<p>She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.</p>
<p>&#8212;Go on, Simon.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.</p>
<p>The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.</p>
<p>Up stage strode Father Cowley.</p>
<p>&#8212;Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.</p>
<p>By Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.</p>
<p>Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: <i>Sonnambula.</i> He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.</p>
<p>Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: <i>Down among the dead men.</i> Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.</p>
<p>Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.</p>
<p>Speech paused on Richie's lips.</p>
<p>Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.</p>
<p>Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.</p>
<p>&#8212;Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>All is lost now</i>.</p>
<p>Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.</p>
<p>Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.</p>
<p>&#8212;A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.</p>
<p>Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.</p>
<p>He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?</p>
<p>Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.</p>
<p>Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.</p>
<p>Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.</p>
<p>&#8212;With it, Simon.</p>
<p>&#8212;It, Simon.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.</p>
<p>&#8212;It, Simon.</p>
<p>&#8212;I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.</p>
<p>By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous <i>eau de Nil</i> Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.</p>
<p>The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>When first I saw that form endearing</i>...</p>
<p>Richie turned.</p>
<p>&#8212;Si Dedalus' voice, he said.</p>
<p>Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Sorrow from me seemed to depart.</i></p>
<p>Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.</p>
<p>Love that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet <i>sonnez la</i> gold. Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Full of hope and all delighted</i>...</p>
<p>Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.</p>
<p>Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>But alas, 'twas idle dreaming</i>...</p>
<p>Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.</p>
<p>Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.</p>
<p>Words? Music? No: it's what's behind.</p>
<p>Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.</p>
<p>Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.</p>
<p>&#8212;... <i>ray of hope is</i>...</p>
<p>Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk.</p>
<p><i>Martha</i> it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song. Lovely name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still the name: Martha. How strange! Today.</p>
<p>The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.</p>
<p>Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Each graceful look</i>...</p>
<p>First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her. Fate.</p>
<p>Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Charmed my eye</i>...</p>
<p>Singing. <i>Waiting</i> she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Martha! Ah, Martha!</i></p>
<p>Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8212;<i>Co-ome, thou lost one!<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Co-ome, thou dear one!</i>
</div>
<p>Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!</p>
<p class="c3">&#8212;Come!</p>
<p>It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>To me!</i></p>
<p>Siopold!</p>
<p>Consumed.</p>
<p>Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us.</p>
<p>&#8212;Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.</p>
<p>Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before. Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now. Atrot, in heat, heatseated. <i>Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la.</i> Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.</p>
<p>An afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.</p>
<p>And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.</p>
<p>&#8212;Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.</p>
<p>Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired, admired. But Bloom sang dumb.</p>
<p>Admiring.</p>
<p>Richie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang <i>'Twas rank and fame</i>: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did <i>then false one we had better part</i> so clear so God he never heard <i>since love lives not</i> a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.</p>
<p>Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang <i>'Twas rank and fame.</i></p>
<p>He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing 'TWAS RANK AND FAME in his, Ned Lambert's, house.</p>
<p>Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more. The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.</p>
<p>That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.</p>
<p>Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.</p>
<p>Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling! Five bob I gave. <i>Corpus paradisum.</i> Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:'d.</p>
<p>Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in your? Twang. It snapped.</p>
<p>Jingle into Dorset street.</p>
<p>Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.</p>
<p>&#8212;Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.</p>
<p>George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.</p>
<p>First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And second tankard told her so. That that was so.</p>
<p>Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank.</p>
<p>Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.</p>
<p>Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.</p>
<p>&#8212;Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.</p>
<p>&#8212;It is, Bloom said.</p>
<p>Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.</p>
<p>Instance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos for that. <i>Blumenlied</i> I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.</p>
<p>Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.</p>
<p>It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles. Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.</p>
<p>Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.</p>
<p>Down the edge of his <i>Freeman</i> baton ranged Bloom's, your other eye, scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick. Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...</p>
<p>Hope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his <i>Freeman.</i> Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline <i>imposs.</i> To write today.</p>
<p>Bore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting fingers on flat pad Pat brought.</p>
<p>On. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the gulls. Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a crown. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you despise? Jingle, have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught? You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes, yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other world she wrote. My patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is. True.</p>
<p>Folly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives. Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she found out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If they don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.</p>
<p>A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare.</p>
<p>&#8212;Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.</p>
<p>Bloom mur: best references. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. You know how. In haste. Henry. Greek ee. Better add postscript. What is he playing now? Improvising. Intermezzo. P. S. The rum tum tum. How will you pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I want to. Know. O. Course if I didn't I wouldn't ask. La la la ree. Trails off there sad in minor. Why minor sad? Sign H. They like sad tail at end. P. P. S. La la la ree. I feel so sad today. La ree. So lonely. Dee.</p>
<p>He blotted quick on pad of Pat. Envel. Address. Just copy out of paper. Murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. Henry wrote:</p>
<p>Miss Martha Clifford c/o P. O. Dolphin's Barn Lane Dublin</p>
<p>Blot over the other so he can't read. There. Right. Idea prize titbit. Something detective read off blottingpad. Payment at the rate of guinea per col. Matcham often thinks the laughing witch. Poor Mrs Purefoy. U. P: up.</p>
<p>Too poetical that about the sad. Music did that. Music hath charms. Shakespeare said. Quotations every day in the year. To be or not to be. Wisdom while you wait.</p>
<p>In Gerard's rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.</p>
<p>Done anyhow. Postal order, stamp. Postoffice lower down. Walk now. Enough. Barney Kiernan's I promised to meet them. Dislike that job.</p>
<p>House of mourning. Walk. Pat! Doesn't hear. Deaf beetle he is.</p>
<p>Car near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins. Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Paint face behind on him then he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep my mind off.</p>
<p>Bald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins. Pat is a waiter hard of his hearing. Pat is a waiter who waits while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. Hee hee. A waiter is he. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. While you wait if you wait he will wait while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. Hoh. Wait while you wait.</p>
<p>Douce now. Douce Lydia. Bronze and rose.</p>
<p>She had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell she brought.</p>
<p>To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.</p>
<p>&#8212;Listen! she bade him.</p>
<p>Under Tom Kernan's ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow. Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband took him by the throat. <i>Scoundrel,</i> said he, <i>You'll sing no more lovesongs.</i> He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom. Cowley lay back.</p>
<p>Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard.</p>
<p>Wonderful. She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided. To hear.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.</p>
<p>Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.</p>
<p>Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside. Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget. Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.</p>
<p>The sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.</p>
<p>Wonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing: then laid it by, gently.</p>
<p>&#8212;What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.</p>
<p>Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>By Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan turned.</p>
<p>From the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No, she was not so lonely archly miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know. Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly answered: with a gentleman friend.</p>
<p>Bob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four.</p>
<p>Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket, cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere. Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of <i>Don Giovanni</i> he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.</p>
<p>That's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then know.</p>
<p>M'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk. Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage men's intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open. Molly in <i>quis est homo</i>: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear. Want a woman who can deliver the goods.</p>
<p>Jog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue clocks came light to earth.</p>
<p>O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.</p>
<p>One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Qui sdegno,</i> Ben, said Father Cowley.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. <i>The Croppy Boy.</i> Our native Doric.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.</p>
<p>&#8212;Do, do, they begged in one.</p>
<p>I'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To me. How much?</p>
<p>&#8212;What key? Six sharps?</p>
<p>&#8212;F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.</p>
<p>Bob Cowley's outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.</p>
<p>Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.</p>
<p>But wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.</p>
<p>The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Ben Dollard's voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it. Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big ships' chandler's business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships' lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.</p>
<p>The priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.</p>
<p>Ruin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.</p>
<p>The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.</p>
<p>Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in <i>Answers,</i> poets' picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.</p>
<p>Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. The chords harped slower.</p>
<p>The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous. Ben's contrite beard confessed. <i>in nomine Domini,</i> in God's name he knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: <i>mea culpa.</i></p>
<p>Latin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, <i>corpusnomine.</i> Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>They listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.</p>
<p>The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed three times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.</p>
<p>Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.</p>
<p>Bronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face? They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.</p>
<p>Cockcarracarra.</p>
<p>What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it sounds. Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.</p>
<p>She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show. Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!</p>
<p>All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of his name and race.</p>
<p>I too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?</p>
<p>He bore no hate.</p>
<p>Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old. Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?</p>
<p>Ireland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Bless me, father,</i> Dollard the croppy cried. <i>Bless me and let me go.</i></p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week. Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance. Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's owny Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.</p>
<p>Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Thrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.</p>
<p>Blank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I didn't see. They want it. Not too much polite. That's why he gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear. With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.</p>
<p>Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?</p>
<p>Will? You? I. Want. You. To.</p>
<p>With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch's bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live, your last.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.</p>
<p>A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.</p>
<p>But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.</p>
<p>On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.</p>
<p>With a cock with a carra.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.</p>
<p>The chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be. Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.</p>
<p>Well, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O'er ryehigh blue. Ow. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have sweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside. Yes.</p>
<p>By deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.</p>
<p>At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.</p>
<p>By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.</p>
<p>Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to wash it down. Glad I avoided.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you're as good as ever you were.</p>
<p>&#8212;Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad, upon my soul and honour It is.</p>
<p>&#8212;Lablache, said Father Cowley.</p>
<p>Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air.</p>
<p>Big Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.</p>
<p>Rrr.</p>
<p>And deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all laughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.</p>
<p>&#8212;You're looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.</p>
<p>Miss Douce composed her rose to wait.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben's fat back shoulderblade. Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person.</p>
<p>Rrrrrrrsss.</p>
<p>&#8212;Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.</p>
<p>Richie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly he waited. Unpaid Pat too.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.</p>
<p>&#8212;Mr Dollard, they murmured low.</p>
<p>&#8212;Dollard, murmured tankard.</p>
<p>Tank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the tank.</p>
<p>He murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And <i>The last rose of summer</i> was a lovely song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.</p>
<p>'Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round inside.</p>
<p>Gassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J's one and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street. Wish I hadn't promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your nerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth. That rules the world.</p>
<p>Far. Far. Far. Far.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.</p>
<p>Tap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.</p>
<p>Cowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty. You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.</p>
<p>All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys. Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing (want to have wadding or something in his no don't she cried), then all of a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.</p>
<p>Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.</p>
<p>&#8212;Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam's...</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.</p>
<p>&#8212;By the bye there's a tuningfork in there on the...</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>&#8212;The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw, forgot it when he was here.</p>
<p>Blind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so exquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.</p>
<p>&#8212;Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!</p>
<p>&#8212;'lldo! cried Father Cowley.</p>
<p>Rrrrrr.</p>
<p>I feel I want...</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap</p>
<p>&#8212;Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.</p>
<p>Under the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last sardine of summer. Bloom alone.</p>
<p>&#8212;Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Bloom went by Barry's. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had. Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love one another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.</p>
<p>But for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Mickey Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after pig's cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt them through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by Daly's window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn't see) blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid, coolest whiff of all.</p>
<p>Instruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even comb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in Lombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its own, don't you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? <i>Cloche. Sonnez la.</i> Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee. Policeman a whistle. Locks and keys! Sweep! Four o'clock's all's well! Sleep! All is lost now. Drum? Pompedy. Wait. I know. Towncrier, bumbailiff. Long John. Waken the dead. Pom. Dignam. Poor little <i>nominedomine.</i> Pom. It is music. I mean of course it's all pom pom pom very much what they call <i>da capo.</i> Still you can hear. As we march, we march along, march along. Pom.</p>
<p>I must really. Fff. Now if I did that at a banquet. Just a question of custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same he must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap. Muffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin. O, the whore of the lane!</p>
<p>A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn. Who had the? Heehaw shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any chance of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with you in the brown costume. Put you off your stroke, that. Appointment we made knowing we'd never, well hardly ever. Too dear too near to home sweet home. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face like dip. Damn her. O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look in here.</p>
<p>In Lionel Marks's antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you don't want it. That's what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to charge me for the edge he gave it. She's passing now. Six bob.</p>
<p>Must be the cider or perhaps the burgund.</p>
<p>Near bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia's tempting last rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth: Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.</p>
<p>Tap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.</p>
<p>Bloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks's window. Robert Emmet's last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.</p>
<p>&#8212;True men like you men.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, ay, Ben.</p>
<p>&#8212;Will lift your glass with us.</p>

<p>Pprrpffrrppffff.</p>
<p class="c3">Done.</p>
<p>I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.</p>
<p>&#8212;Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?</p>
<p>&#8212;Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?</p>
<p>&#8212;Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.</p>
<p>&#8212;What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane&#8212;old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him&#8212;lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.</p>
<p>&#8212;Circumcised? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.</p>
<p>&#8212;That the lay you're on now? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. <i>Tell him,</i> says he, <i>I dare him,</i> says he, <i>and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does,</i> says he, <i>I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence.</i> And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. <i>He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?</i></p>
<p>For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.</p>
<p>&#8212;Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Not taking anything between drinks, says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.</p>
<p>&#8212;Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.</p>
<p>&#8212;Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?</p>
<p>&#8212;Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.</p>
<p>&#8212;-What was that, Joe? says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.</p>
<p>So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.</p>
<p>In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.</p>
<p>And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.</p>
<p>I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!</p>
<p>And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.</p>
<p>So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.</p>
<p>&#8212;There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.</p>
<p>The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.</p>
<p>&#8212;Stand and deliver, says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.</p>
<p>&#8212;Pass, friends, says he.</p>
<p>Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:</p>
<p>&#8212;What's your opinion of the times?</p>
<p>Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8212;I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.</p>
<p>So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:</p>
<p>&#8212;Foreign wars is the cause of it.</p>
<p>And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:</p>
<p>&#8212;It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.</p>
<p>&#8212;Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.</p>
<p>&#8212;Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Wine of the country, says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's yours? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;Never better, <i>a chara</i>, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?</p>
<p>And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.</p>
<p>The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (<i>Ulex Europeus</i>). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.</p>
<p>He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.</p>
