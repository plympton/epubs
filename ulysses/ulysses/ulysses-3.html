<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Those girls, those girls,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Those lovely seaside girls.</i>
</div>
<p>Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.</p>
<p>A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.</p>
<p>Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or through M'Coy.</p>
<p>The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait. Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.</p>
<p>He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.</p>
<p>&#8212;Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I'm ready.</p>
<p>Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.</p>
<p>A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as I'm.</p>
<p>In the tabledrawer he found an old number of <i>Titbits</i>. He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.</p>
<p>Listening, he heard her voice:</p>
<p>&#8212;Come, come, pussy. Come.</p>
<p>He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. The maid was in the garden. Fine morning.</p>
<p>He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. Make a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur. All soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this that is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.</p>
<p>He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don't remember that. Hallstand too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters. Drago's shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown brillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say. O'Brien.</p>
<p>Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss. Enthusiast.</p>
<p>He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his countinghouse. Nobody.</p>
<p>Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a bit. Our prize titbit: <i>Matcham's Masterstroke</i>. Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.</p>
<p>Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat certainly. <i>Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now</i>. Begins and ends morally. <i>Hand in hand</i>. Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.</p>
<p>Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for some proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.l5. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that cabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.</p>
<p>Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money. Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes. It wouldn't pan out somehow.</p>
<p>Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.</p>
<p>He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.</p>
<p>In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.</p>
<p>A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Heigho! Heigho!<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Heigho! Heigho!<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Heigho! Heigho!</i>
</div>
<p>Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air, third.</p>
<p>Poor Dignam!</p>
<p>By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office. Could have given that address too. And past the sailors' home. He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street. By Brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell him if he smokes he won't grow. O let him! His life isn't such a bed of roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da. Slack hour: won't be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past Nichols' the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O'Neill's. Singing with his eyes shut. Corny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark. Police tout. Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay. O, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.</p>
<p>In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom Kernan. Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p>So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like that. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in <i>dolce far niente</i>, not doing a hand's turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to quarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn't sink if you tried: so thick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight? It's a law something like that. Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum. What is weight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second per second. They all fall to the ground. The earth. It's the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.</p>
<p>He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded <i>Freeman</i> from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air: just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second for every second it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.</p>
<p>He handed the card through the brass grill.</p>
<p>&#8212;Are there any letters for me? he asked.</p>
<p>While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably. Went too far last time.</p>
<p>The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.</p>
<p>Henry Flower Esq, c/o P. O. Westland Row, City.</p>
<p>Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where's old Tweedy's regiment? Castoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he's a grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to enlist and drill. Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith's paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front. Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King's own. Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.</p>
<p>He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. Women will pay a lot of heed, I don't think. His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.</p>
<p>M'Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when you.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, M'Coy. Nowhere in particular.</p>
<p>&#8212;How's the body?</p>
<p>&#8212;Fine. How are you?</p>
<p>&#8212;Just keeping alive, M'Coy said.</p>
<p>His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:</p>
<p>&#8212;Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you're...</p>
<p>&#8212;O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.</p>
<p>&#8212;To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?</p>
<p>A photo it isn't. A badge maybe.</p>
<p>&#8212;E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.</p>
<p>&#8212;I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?</p>
<p>&#8212;I know.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take the starch out of her.</p>
<p>&#8212;I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway's we were.</p>
<p>Doran Lyons in Conway's. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will she get up?</p>
<p>&#8212;And he said: <i>Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?</i> I said. <i>Poor little Paddy Dignam</i>, he said.</p>
<p>Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for? Sees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two strings to her bow.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Why?</i> I said. <i>What's wrong with him?</i> I said.</p>
<p>Proud: rich: silk stockings.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p>He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. Getting up in a minute.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>What's wrong with him</i>? He said. <i>He's dead</i>, he said. And, faith, he filled up. <i>Is it Paddy Dignam</i>? I said. I couldn't believe it when I heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch. <i>Yes,</i> he said. <i>He's gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow</i>. Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!</p>
<p>A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.</p>
<p>Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering the display of <i>esprit de corps</i>. Well, what are you gaping at?</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.</p>
<p>&#8212;One of the best, M'Coy said.</p>
<p>The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.</p>
<p>&#8212;Wife well, I suppose? M'Coy's changed voice said.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.</p>
<p>He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:</p>
<p class="c3">What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat? Incomplete With it an abode of bliss.</p>
<p>&#8212;My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled yet.</p>
<p>Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I'm off that, thanks.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.</p>
<p>&#8212;My wife too, he said. She's going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twenty-fifth.</p>
<p>&#8212;That so? M'Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who's getting it up?</p>
<p>Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Love's<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Old<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sweet<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Song<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Comes lo-ove's old...</i>
</div>
<p>&#8212;It's a kind of a tour, don't you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully. <i>Sweeeet song</i>. There's a committee formed. Part shares and part profits.</p>
<p>M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, well, he said. That's good news.</p>
<p>He moved to go.</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Tell you what, M'Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral, will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if I'm not there, will you?</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all right.</p>
<p>&#8212;Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M'Coy will do.</p>
<p>&#8212;That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.</p>
<p>Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I'd like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don't you know: in the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can't he hear the difference? Think he's that way inclined a bit. Against my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that smallpox up there doesn't get worse. Suppose she wouldn't let herself be vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.</p>
<p>Wonder is he pimping after me?</p>
<p>Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery's Summer Sale. No, he's going on straight. Hello. <i>Leah</i> tonight. Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Like to see her again in that. <i>Hamlet</i> she played last night. Male impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed suicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.</p>
<p>Nathan's voice! His son's voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.</p>
<p>Every word is so deep, Leopold.</p>
<p>Poor papa! Poor man! I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his face. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn't met that M'Coy fellow.</p>
<p>He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. Too full for words. Still they get their feed all right and their doss. Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.</p>
<p>He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.</p>
<p>He passed the cabman's shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies. All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. <i>Voglio e non</i>. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying syllables as they pass. He hummed:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>La ci darem la mano<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; La la lala la la.</i>
</div>
<p>He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade's timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb them. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it. And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame's school. She liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis's. And Mr? He opened the letter within the newspaper.</p>
<p>A flower. I think it's a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not annoyed then? What does she say?</p>
<p>Dear Henry</p>
<p>I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you. Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache. today. and write <i>by return</i> to your longing</p>
<p>Martha</p>
<p>P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to know.</p>
<p>He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it because no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don't please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's perfume. Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.</p>
<p>Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did she wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners. Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course. Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.</p>
<p>Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses without thorns.</p>
<p>Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>O, Mary lost the pin of her drawers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; She didn't know what to do<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To keep it up<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To keep it up.</i>
</div>
<p>It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all day typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your wife use. Now could you make out a thing like that?</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>To keep it up.</i>
</div>
<p>Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>To keep it up.</i>
</div>
<p>Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been, strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.</p>
<p>Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.</p>
<p>Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be made out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A million pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter. One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.</p>
<p>What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.</p>
<p>An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.</p>
<p>He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy for a pass to Mullingar.</p>
<p>Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.J. on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious. The protestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the true religion. Save China's millions. Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for them. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy with hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo. Crown of thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. Chopsticks? Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking. Sorry I didn't work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn't. They're taught that. He's not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Still life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.</p>
<p>The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.</p>
<p>Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow music. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her hat sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? <i>Corpus:</i> body. Corpse. Good idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They don't seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.</p>
<p>He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear. We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called. There's a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm sure of that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish. Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next year.</p>
<p>He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn't know what to do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S. Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.</p>
<p>Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children at home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers, now that's a good name for them, there's always something shiftylooking about them. They're not straight men of business either. O, no, she's not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope? Yes: under the bridge.</p>
<p>The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley's Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale (aromatic). Doesn't give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. Cold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they'd have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the <i>vibrato</i>: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the <i>Stabat Mater</i> of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or Pilate? Christ, but don't keep us all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:</p>
<p class="c3">Quis est homo.</p>
<p>Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words. Mozart's twelfth mass: <i>Gloria</i> in that. Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after. Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don't they? Gluttons, tall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.</p>
<p>He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:</p>
<p>&#8212;O God, our refuge and our strength...</p>
<p>Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them the bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious and immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More interesting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants to. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon in their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I schschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look down at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears. Husband learn to his surprise. God's little joke. Then out she comes. Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting. How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show. And don't they rake in the money too? Bequests also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion. Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors. Monasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything. Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.</p>
<p>The priest prayed:</p>
<p>&#8212;Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.</p>
<p>The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women remained behind: thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate perhaps. Pay your Easter duty.</p>
<p>He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there's a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked. Glimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don't. Why didn't you tell me before. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn't farther south. He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott's dyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Notice because I'm in mourning myself. He covered himself. How goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion made up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny's in Lincoln place. Chemists rarely move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir. Hamilton Long's, founded in the year of the flood. Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit some day.</p>
<p>He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair. O well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. When was it I got it made up last? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must have been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.</p>
<p>The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's stone. The alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then. Why? Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character. Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his alabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid. Smell almost cure you like the dentist's doorbell. Doctor Whack. He ought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to be careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns blue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it. Clever of nature.</p>
<p>&#8212;About a fortnight ago, sir?</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p>He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.</p>
<p>&#8212;Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...</p>
<p>It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.</p>
<p>&#8212;And white wax also, he said.</p>
<p>Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. Skinfood. One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only one skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? <i>Peau d'Espagne</i>. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a bottle?</p>
<p>&#8212;No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day and I'll take one of these soaps. How much are they?</p>
<p>&#8212;Fourpence, sir.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.</p>
<p>&#8212;Good, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p>He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.</p>
<p>At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said:</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Bloom. What's the best news? Is that today's? Show us a minute.</p>
<p>Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.</p>
<p>Bantam Lyons's yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears' soap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.</p>
<p>&#8212;I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?</p>
<p>He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar. Barber's itch. Tight collar he'll lose his hair. Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.</p>
<p>&#8212;You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the second.</p>
<p>&#8212;I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p>Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's that? his sharp voice said.</p>
<p>&#8212;I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away that moment.</p>
<p>Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom's arms.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.</p>
<p>He sped off towards Conway's corner. God speed scut.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large tender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now. They never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.</p>
<p>He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college. Something to catch the eye.</p>
<p>There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How do you do, sir?</p>
<p>Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather. Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can't play it here. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the floor. Heatwave. Won't last. Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.</p>
<p>Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream. This is my body.</p>
<p>He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.</p>
<p>Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come on, Simon.</p>
<p>&#8212;After you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>&#8212;Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.</p>
<p>All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p>All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.</p>
<p>They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.</p>
<p>&#8212;What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.</p>
<p>&#8212;Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.</p>
<p>&#8212;That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.</p>
<p>All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.</p>
<p>&#8212;There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who is that?</p>
<p>&#8212;Your son and heir.</p>
<p>&#8212;Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.</p>
<p>The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:</p>
<p>&#8212;Was that Mulligan cad with him? His <i>fidus Achates</i>!</p>
<p>&#8212;No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.</p>
<p>&#8212;Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.</p>
<p>Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.</p>
<p>&#8212;He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.</p>
<p>He cried above the clatter of the wheels:</p>
<p>&#8212;I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.</p>
<p>He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.</p>
<p>Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.</p>
<p>&#8212;Are we late? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.</p>
<p>Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too. Life, life.</p>
<p>The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.</p>
<p>&#8212;Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.</p>
<p>&#8212;He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?</p>
<p>He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.</p>
<p>&#8212;What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?</p>
<p>&#8212;Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.</p>
<p>All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:</p>
<p>&#8212;Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?</p>
<p>&#8212;It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.</p>
<p>&#8212;After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>&#8212;Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.</p>
<p>&#8212;And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p>&#8212;I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.</p>
<p>The carriage halted short.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's wrong?</p>
<p>&#8212;We're stopped.</p>
<p>&#8212;Where are we?</p>
<p>Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.</p>
<p>&#8212;The grand canal, he said.</p>
<p>Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss this chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's dogs usually are.</p>
<p>A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.</p>
<p>&#8212;The weather is changing, he said quietly.</p>
<p>&#8212;A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming out.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.</p>
<p>&#8212;It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.</p>
<p>&#8212;We're off again.</p>
<p>The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.</p>
<p>&#8212;Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of <i>The Croppy Boy</i>.</p>
<p>&#8212;Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. <i>His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the retrospective arrangement.</p>
<p>&#8212;Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?</p>
<p>&#8212;In the paper this morning.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change for her.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton, Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind: Quinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.</p>
<p class="c3">It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.</p>
<p>I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Before my patience are exhausted.</p>
<p>National school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their hats.</p>
<p>A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?</p>
<p>Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law perhaps.</p>
<p>They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or the <i>Lily of Killarney</i>? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. <i>Fun on the Bristol</i>. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.</p>
<p>He's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.</p>
<p>Plasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?</p>
<p>&#8212;How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.</p>
<p>&#8212;He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?</p>
<p>&#8212;Who? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.</p>
<p>Just that moment I was thinking.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.</p>
<p>He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.</p>
<p>Mr Power asked:</p>
<p>&#8212;How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?</p>
<p>&#8212;O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good idea, you see...</p>
<p>&#8212;Are you going yourself?</p>
<p>&#8212;Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.</p>
<p>&#8212;Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.</p>
<p>Have you good artists?</p>
<p>&#8212;Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.</p>
<p>&#8212;And <i>Madame</i>, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.</p>
<p>Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.</p>
<p>&#8212;Four bootlaces for a penny.</p>
<p>Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street. Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake. O'Callaghan on his last legs.</p>
<p>And <i>Madame</i>. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing her hair, humming. <i>voglio e non vorrei</i>. No. <i>vorrei e non</i>. Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. <i>Mi trema un poco il</i>. Beautiful on that <i>tre</i> her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.</p>
<p>His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over the ears. <i>Madame</i>: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the Moira, was it?</p>
<p>They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.</p>
<p>Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.</p>
<p>&#8212;Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.</p>
<p>A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.</p>
<p>&#8212;In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:</p>
<p>&#8212;The devil break the hasp of your back!</p>
<p>Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray's statue.</p>
<p>&#8212;We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.</p>
<p>His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, nearly all of us.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.</p>
<p>&#8212;That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.</p>
<p>&#8212;About the boatman? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes. Isn't it awfully good?</p>
<p>&#8212;What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.</p>
<p>&#8212;There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both ...</p>
<p>&#8212;What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown...</p>
<p>&#8212;Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!</p>
<p>Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself...</p>
<p>Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:</p>
<p>&#8212;Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.</p>
<p>&#8212;For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?</p>
<p>&#8212;Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...</p>
<p>&#8212;And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son's life.</p>
<p>A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.</p>
<p>&#8212;Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8212;One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.</p>
<p>Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.</p>
<p>Nelson's pillar.</p>
<p>&#8212;Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!</p>
<p>&#8212;We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus sighed.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself.</p>
<p>&#8212;The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's gone from us.</p>
<p>&#8212;As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went very suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8212;Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.</p>
<p>He tapped his chest sadly.</p>
<p>Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring it.</p>
<p>Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.</p>
<p>&#8212;He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.</p>
<p>&#8212;The best death, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p>Their wide open eyes looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8212;No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.</p>
<p>No-one spoke.</p>
<p>Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.</p>
<p>White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.</p>
<p>&#8212;Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.</p>
<p>A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not from the man. Better luck next time.</p>
<p>&#8212;Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.</p>
<p>The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.</p>
<p>&#8212;In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p>&#8212;But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.</p>
<p>Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.</p>
<p>&#8212;The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.</p>
<p>&#8212;Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We must take a charitable view of it.</p>
<p>&#8212;They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p>&#8212;It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin's umbrella.</p>
