</div>
<p>&#8212;She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the <i>Merry Wives</i> and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over <i>Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches</i> and <i>The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze</i>. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.</p>
<p>&#8212;History shows that to be true, <i>inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos</i>. The ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.</p>
<p>Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a gentleman to see you. Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.</p>
<p>Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.</p>
<p>Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.</p>
<p>&#8212;A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death. If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, <i>nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</i>, with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. <i>Amor matris</i>, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son?</p>
<p>What the hell are you driving at?</p>
<p>I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.</p>
<p class="c3">Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.</p>
<p>Are you condemned to do this?</p>
<p>&#8212;They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.</p>
<p>In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.</p>
<p>&#8212;What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p>
<p>Am I a father? If I were?</p>
<p>Shrunken uncertain hand.</p>
<p>&#8212;Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote <i>Hamlet</i> he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.</p>
<p>Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.</p>
<p>Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.</p>
<p>&#8212;Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The play's the thing! Let me parturiate!</p>
<p>He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.</p>
<p>&#8212;As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in <i>Coriolanus.</i> His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in <i>King John.</i> Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls in <i>The Tempest</i>, in <i>Pericles,</i> in <i>Winter's Tale</i> are we know. Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.</p>
<p>&#8212;The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p>The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with haste, quake, quack.</p>
<p>Door closed. Cell. Day.</p>
<p>They list. Three. They.</p>
<p>I you he they.</p>
<p>Come, mess.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The playhouse sausage filled Gilbert's soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.</p>
<p>MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What's in a name?</p>
<p>BEST: That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going to say a good word for Richard, don't you know, for my sake. <i>(Laughter)</i></p>
<p>BUCKMULLIGAN: (<i>Piano, diminuendo</i>)</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Then outspoke medical Dick<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To his comrade medical Davy...</i>
</div>
<p>STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard Crookback, Edmund in <i>King Lear</i>, two bear the wicked uncles' names. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.</p>
<p>BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name ...</p>
<p class="c3">(Laughter)</p>
<p>QUAKERLYSTER: (<i>A tempo</i>) But he that filches from me my good name...</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Stringendo)</i> He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o'Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What's in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.</p>
<p>Both satisfied. I too.</p>
<p>Don't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.</p>
<p>And from her arms.</p>
<p>Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?</p>
<p>Read the skies. <i>Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos.</i> Where's your configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: <i>sua donna. Gi&#224;: di lui. gelindo risolve di non amare</i> S. D.</p>
<p>&#8212;What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon?</p>
<p>&#8212;A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.</p>
<p>What more's to speak?</p>
<p>Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.</p>
<p><i>Stephanos,</i> my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.</p>
<p>&#8212;You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.</p>
<p>Me, Magee and Mulligan.</p>
<p>Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. <i>Pater, ait.</i> Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.</p>
<p>Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:</p>
<p>&#8212;That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.</p>
<p>Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.</p>
<p>The quaker librarian springhalted near.</p>
<p>&#8212;I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps I am anticipating?</p>
<p>He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.</p>
<p>An attendant from the doorway called:</p>
<p>&#8212;Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...</p>
<p>&#8212;O, Father Dineen! Directly.</p>
<p>Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.</p>
<p>John Eglinton touched the foil.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn't you?</p>
<p>&#8212;In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.</p>
<p>Lapwing.</p>
<p>Where is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.</p>
<p>Lapwing.</p>
<p>I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>&#8212;You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others? Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence, the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of <i>King Lear</i> in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?</p>
<p>&#8212;That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. <i>Que voulez-vous?</i> Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.</p>
<p>&#8212;Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, twice in <i>As you like It</i>, in <i>The Tempest</i>, in <i>Hamlet,</i> in <i>Measure for Measure</i>&#8212;and in all the other plays which I have not read.</p>
<p>He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.</p>
<p>Judge Eglinton summed up.</p>
<p>&#8212;The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He is all in all.</p>
<p>&#8212;He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five. All in all. In <i>Cymbeline,</i> in <i>Othello</i> he is bawd and cuckold. He acts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.</p>
<p>&#8212;Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!</p>
<p>Dark dome received, reverbed.</p>
<p>&#8212;And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When all is said Dumas <i>fils</i> (or is it Dumas <i>p&#232;re?)</i> is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.</p>
<p>&#8212;Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet <i>(p&#232;re?)</i> and Hamlet <i>fils.</i> A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: <i>If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend.</i> Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call <i>dio boia</i>, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.</p>
<p><i>&#8212;Eureka!</i> Buck Mulligan cried. <i>Eureka!</i></p>
<p>Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's desk.</p>
<p>&#8212;May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.</p>
<p>He began to scribble on a slip of paper.</p>
<p>Take some slips from the counter going out.</p>
<p>&#8212;Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.</p>
<p>He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.</p>
<p>Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of <i>The Taming of the Shrew.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?</p>
<p>&#8212;No, Stephen said promptly.</p>
<p>&#8212;Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.</p>
<p>John Eclecticon doubly smiled.</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is some mystery in <i>Hamlet</i> but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.</p>
<p>I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? <i>Egomen.</i> Who to unbelieve? Other chap.</p>
<p>&#8212;You are the only contributor to <i>Dana</i> who asks for pieces of silver. Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.</p>
<p>Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.</p>
<p>&#8212;For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:</p>
<p>&#8212;I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.</p>
<p>He broke away.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.</p>
<p>Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.</p>
<p>Stephen rose.</p>
<p>Life is many days. This will end.</p>
<p>&#8212;We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <i>Notre ami</i> Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.</p>
<p>&#8212;Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight?</p>
<p>Laughing, he...</p>
<p>Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.</p>
<p>Lubber...</p>
<p>Stephen followed a lubber...</p>
<p>One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His lub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.</p>
<p>Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.</p>
<p>What have I learned? Of them? Of me?</p>
<p>Walk like Haines now.</p>
<p>The constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet mad? The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.</p>
<p>&#8212;O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...</p>
<p>Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:</p>
<p>&#8212;A pleased bottom.</p>
<p>The turnstile.</p>
<p>Is that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...</p>
<p>The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.</p>
<p>Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:</p>
<p class="c3">John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won't you wed a wife?</p>
<p>He spluttered to the air:</p>
<p>&#8212;O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.</p>
<p>He spat blank.</p>
<p>Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And left the <i>femme de trente ans.</i> And why no other children born? And his first child a girl?</p>
<p>Afterwit. Go back.</p>
<p>The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling, minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair.</p>
<p>Eh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...</p>
<p>&#8212;Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there...</p>
<p>Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>I hardly hear the purlieu cry<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Or a tommy talk as I pass one by<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Before my thoughts begin to run<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On F. M'Curdy Atkinson,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The same that had the wooden leg<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And that filibustering filibeg<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; That never dared to slake his drouth,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Magee that had the chinless mouth.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Being afraid to marry on earth<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They masturbated for all they were worth.</i>
</div>
<p>Jest on. Know thyself.</p>
<p>Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.</p>
<p>&#8212;Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.</p>
<p>A laugh tripped over his lips.</p>
<p>&#8212;Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn't you do the Yeats touch?</p>
<p>He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:</p>
<p>&#8212;The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time. One thinks of Homer.</p>
<p>He stopped at the stairfoot.</p>
<p>&#8212;I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.</p>
<p>The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's morrice with caps of indices.</p>
<p>In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: <i>Everyman His own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan.</i></p>
<p>He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p>&#8212;The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.</p>
<p>He read, <i>marcato:</i></p>
<p>&#8212;Characters:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; TODY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CRAB (a bushranger)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; MEDICAL DICK )<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; and&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ) (two birds with one stone)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; MEDICAL DAVY )<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; FRESH NELLY<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; and<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).<br>
</div>
<p>He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:</p>
<p>&#8212;O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!</p>
<p>&#8212;The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.</p>
<p>About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.</p>
<p>Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.</p>
<p>My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.</p>
<p>A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.</p>
<p>&#8212;Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
<p>The portico.</p>
<p>Here I watched the birds for augury. Aengus of the birds. They go, they come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.</p>
<p>&#8212;The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.</p>
<p>Manner of Oxenford.</p>
<p>Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.</p>
<p>A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.</p>
<p>They followed.</p>
<p>Offend me still. Speak on.</p>
<p>Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.</p>
<p>Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Laud we the gods<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From our bless'd altars.</i>
</div>
<p>The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again? Dignam. Yes. <i>Vere dignum et iustum est.</i> Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.</p>
<p>A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.</p>
<p>Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: <i>If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days.</i> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.</p>
<p>&#8212;Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?</p>
<p>Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.</p>
<p>Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.</p>
<p>&#8212;Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.</p>
<p>Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.</p>
<p>Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.</p>
<p>&#8212;Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?</p>
<p>A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?</p>
<p>O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.</p>
<p>Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.</p>
<p>Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.</p>
<p>&#8212;But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.</p>
<p>The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:</p>
<p>&#8212;O, sir.</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.</p>
<p>Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.</p>
<p>Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.</p>
<p>Was that not Mrs M'Guinness?</p>
<p>Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do?</p>
<p>A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien.</p>
<p>Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.</p>
<p>Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.</p>
<p>A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.</p>
<p>Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.</p>
<p>Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.</p>
<p>Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.</p>
<p>Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.</p>
<p>Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.</p>
<p>Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.</p>
<p>On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.</p>
<p>Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.</p>
<p>At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.</p>
<p>Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.</p>
<p>It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.</p>
<p>Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.</p>
<p>Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.</p>
<p>At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice <i>bless you, my child,</i> that they have been absolved, <i>pray for me.</i> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.</p>
<p>From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.</p>
<p>Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, <i>Le Nombre des &#201;lus,</i> seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.</p>
<p>At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.</p>
<p>The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.</p>
<p>Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book <i>Old Times in the Barony</i> and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.</p>
<p>A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, <i>eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,</i> with her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.</p>
<p>Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.</p>
<p>Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.</p>
<p>It was a charming day.</p>
<p>The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. <i>Moutonner,</i> the French said. A just and homely word.</p>
<p>Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.</p>
<p>Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.</p>
<p>Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.</p>
<p>Father Conmee read in secret <i>Pater</i> and <i>Ave</i> and crossed his breast. <i>Deus in adiutorium.</i></p>
<p>He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to <i>Res</i> in <i>Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae.</i></p>
<p>A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.</p>
<p>Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. <i>Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.</p>
<p>Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.</p>
<p>Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.</p>
<p>Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.</p>
<p>&#8212;That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, Corny Kelleher said.</p>
<p>&#8212;It's very close, the constable said.</p>
<p>Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's the best news? he asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.</p>
<hr>
<p>A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>For England</i>...</p>
<p>He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>home and beauty.</i></p>
<p>J. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.</p>
<p>A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.</p>
<p>He halted and growled angrily:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>For England</i>...</p>
<p>Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.</p>
<p>He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>home and beauty.</i></p>
<p>The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card <i>Unfurnished Apartments</i> slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.</p>
<p>One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's cap, saying:</p>
<p>&#8212;There, sir.</p>
<hr>
<p>Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8212;Did you put in the books? Boody asked.</p>
<p>Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.</p>
<p>&#8212;They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.</p>
<p>Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.</p>
<p>&#8212;Where did you try? Boody asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;M'Guinness's.</p>
<p>Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.</p>
<p>&#8212;Bad cess to her big face! she cried.</p>
<p>Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's in the pot? she asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;Shirts, Maggy said.</p>
<p>Boody cried angrily:</p>
<p>&#8212;Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?</p>
<p>Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:</p>
<p>&#8212;And what's in this?</p>
<p>A heavy fume gushed in answer.</p>
<p>&#8212;Peasoup, Maggy said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Where did you get it? Katey asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.</p>
<p>The lacquey rang his bell.</p>
<p>&#8212;Barang!</p>
<p>Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:</p>
<p>&#8212;Give us it here.</p>
<p>Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:</p>
<p>&#8212;A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?</p>
<p>&#8212;Gone to meet father, Maggy said.</p>
<p>Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:</p>
<p>&#8212;Our father who art not in heaven.</p>
<p>Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8212;Boody! For shame!</p>
<p>A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.</p>
<hr>
<p>The blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.</p>
<p>&#8212;Put these in first, will you? he said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.</p>
<p>&#8212;That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p>She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.</p>
<p>Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.</p>
<p>H. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.</p>
<p>He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain's length.</p>
<p>&#8212;Can you send them by tram? Now?</p>
<p>A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's cart.</p>
<p>&#8212;Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?</p>
<p>&#8212;O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.</p>
<p>The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.</p>
<p>&#8212;Will you write the address, sir?</p>
<p>Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.</p>
<p>&#8212;Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, sir. I will, sir.</p>
<p>Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's the damage? he asked.</p>
<p>The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.</p>
<p>Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.</p>
<p>&#8212;This for me? he asked gallantly.</p>
<p>The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, sir, she said.</p>
<p>Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.</p>
<p>Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.</p>
<p>&#8212;May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.</p>
<hr>
<p><i>&#8212;Ma!</i> Almidano Artifoni said.</p>
<p>He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.</p>
<p>Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo &#232; una bestia. &#201; peccato. Perch&#232; la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Sacrifizio incruento,</i> Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.</p>
<p><i>&#8212;Speriamo,</i> the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. <i>Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta</i>.</p>
<p>By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Ci rifletter&#242;,</i> Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Ma, sul serio, eh?</i> Almidano Artifoni said.</p>
<p>His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.</p>
<p><i>&#8212;Eccolo,</i> Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. <i>Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Arrivederla, maestro,</i> Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. <i>E grazie.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Di che?</i> Almidano Artifoni said. <i>Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!</i></p>
<p>Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.</p>
<hr>
<p>Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of <i>The Woman in White</i> far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.</p>
<p>Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.</p>
<p>The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.</p>
<p>Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:</p>
<p>&#8212;16 June 1904.</p>
<p>Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.</p>
<p>Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.</p>
<p>The telephone rang rudely by her ear.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.</p>
<p>She scribbled three figures on an envelope.</p>
<p>&#8212;Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five.</p>
<hr>
<p>Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?</p>
<p>&#8212;Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.</p>
<p>The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.</p>
<p>&#8212;How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?</p>
<p>&#8212;No, Ned.</p>
<p>&#8212;He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.</p>
<p>&#8212;That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.</p>
<p>&#8212;If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...</p>
<p>&#8212;Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here.</p>
<p>In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.</p>
<p>From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass on your valuable time...</p>
<p>&#8212;You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see?</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.</p>
<p>&#8212;Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.</p>
<p>He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O'Connor, Wexford.</p>
<p>He stood to read the card in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8212;The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.</p>
<p>The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.</p>
<p>&#8212;I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.</p>
<p>Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.</p>
<p>&#8212;God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? <i>I'm bloody sorry I did it,</i> says he, <i>but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside.</i> He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.</p>
<p>The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:</p>
<p>&#8212;Woa, sonny!</p>
<p>He turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.</p>
<p>With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.</p>
<p>&#8212;Chow! he said. Blast you!</p>
<p>&#8212;The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...</p>
<p>He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...</p>
<p>&#8212;I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!</p>
<hr>
<p>Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.</p>
<p>&#8212;See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.</p>
<p>He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.</p>
<p>Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.</p>
<p>&#8212;See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see?</p>
<p>He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.</p>
<p>&#8212;Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.</p>
<p>&#8212;See? Tom Rochford said.</p>
<p>He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn deserves another.</p>
<p>&#8212;Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.</p>
<p>&#8212;Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin</p>
<p>Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.</p>
<p>&#8212;But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.</p>
<p>He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.</p>
<p>&#8212;He's a hero, he said simply.</p>
<p>&#8212;I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.</p>
<p>&#8212;Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.</p>
<p>They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.</p>
<p>Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.</p>
<p>&#8212;The act of a hero, he said.</p>
<p>At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.</p>
<p>&#8212;This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and chain?</p>
<p>M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's clock.</p>
<p>&#8212;After three, he said. Who's riding her?</p>
<p>&#8212;O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.</p>
<p>While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.</p>
<p>The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.</p>
<p>&#8212;Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an earthly. Through here.</p>
<p>They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker's cart.</p>
<p>&#8212;There he is, Lenehan said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,</i> Lenehan said.</p>
<p>&#8212;He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.</p>
<p>Lenehan laughed.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over in the sun.</p>
<p>They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.</p>
<p>Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.</p>
<p>&#8212;There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...</p>
<p>&#8212;I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.</p>
<p>&#8212;Did she? Lenehan said.</p>
<p>A card <i>Unfurnished Apartments</i> reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.</p>
<p>He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.</p>
<p>&#8212;But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...</p>
<p>&#8212;I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...</p>
<p>Lenehan linked his arm warmly.</p>
<p>&#8212;But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: <i>Lo, the early beam of morning</i>. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.</p>
<p>He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:</p>
<p>&#8212;I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?</p>
<p>His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.</p>
<p>&#8212;The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. <i>And what star is that, Poldy?</i> says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. <i>That one, is it?</i> says Chris Callinan, <i>sure that's only what you might call a pinprick.</i> By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.</p>
<p>Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'm weak, he gasped.</p>
<p>M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.</p>
<p>&#8212;He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of <i>The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk,</i> then of Aristotle's <i>Masterpiece.</i> Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.</p>
<p>He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: <i>Tales of the Ghetto</i> by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.</p>
<p>&#8212;That I had, he said, pushing it by.</p>
<p>The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.</p>
<p>&#8212;Them are two good ones, he said.</p>
<p>Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.</p>
<p>On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. <i>Fair Tyrants</i> by James Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.</p>
<p>He opened it. Thought so.</p>
<p>A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.</p>
<p>No: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.</p>
<p>He read the other title: <i>Sweets of Sin</i>. More in her line. Let us see.</p>
<p>He read where his finger opened.</p>
<p class="c3">&#8212;All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!</p>
<p>Yes. This. Here. Try.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabill&#233;.</i></p>
<p>Yes. Take this. The end.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.</i></p>
<p>Mr Bloom read again: <i>The beautiful woman.</i></p>
<p>Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (<i>for Him! For Raoul!</i>). Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (<i>her heaving embonpoint!</i>). Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!</p>
<p>Young! Young!</p>
<p>An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.</p>
<p>Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.</p>
<p>Mr Bloom beheld it.</p>
<p>Mastering his troubled breath, he said:</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll take this one.</p>
<p>The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Sweets of Sin,</i> he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.</p>
<hr>
<p>The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.</p>
<p>Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.</p>
