<p>A BLACKSMITH: <i>(Murmurs)</i> For the honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.</p>
<p>A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER: That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!</p>
<p class="c3">(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)</p>
<p>A MILLIONAIRESS: <i>(Richly)</i> Isn't he simply wonderful?</p>
<p>A NOBLEWOMAN: <i>(Nobly)</i> All that man has seen!</p>
<p>A FEMINIST: <i>(Masculinely)</i> And done!</p>
<p>A BELLHANGER: A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)</p>
<p>THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR: I here present your undoubted emperor-president and king-chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!</p>
<p>ALL: God save Leopold the First!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor, with dignity)</i> Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.</p>
<p>WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: <i>(In purple stock and shovel hat)</i> Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears)</i> So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.</p>
<p>MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: <i>(Pours a cruse of hairoil over Bloom's head) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem.</i> Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)</p>
<p>THE PEERS: I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.</p>
<p class="c3">(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moonblue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair, borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)</p>
<p>JOHN HOWARD PARNELL: <i>(Raises the royal standard)</i> Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Embraces John Howard Parnell)</i> We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.</p>
<p class="c3">(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)</p>
<p>TOM KERNAN: You deserve it, your honour.</p>
<p>BLOOM: On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry <i>Bonafide Sabaoth</i>, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.</p>
<p>THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS: Hear! Hear!</p>
<p>JOHN WYSE NOLAN: There's the man that got away James Stephens.</p>
<p>A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY: Bravo!</p>
<p>AN OLD RESIDENT: You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.</p>
<p>AN APPLEWOMAN: He's a man like Ireland wants.</p>
<p>BLOOM: My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.</p>
<p class="c3">(Thirtytwo workmen, wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder, construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice with crystal roof, built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. several paupers fill from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)</p>
<p>THE SIGHTSEERS: <i>(Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die)</i></p>
<p class="c3">(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trapdoor. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)</p>
<p>THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH: Don't you believe a word he says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!</p>
<p><i>(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock,</i> billets doux <i>in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tramlines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy And Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), 50 Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The Lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)</i></p>
<p>THE WOMEN: Little father! Little father!</p>
<p>THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS:</p>

<p>BABY BOARDMAN: <i>(Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth)</i> Hajajaja.</p>

(He gives his coat to a beggar) Please accept. <i>(He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples)</i> Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!</p>
<p>THE CITIZEN: <i>(Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler)</i> May the good God bless him!</p>
<p class="c3">(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)</p>

<p>PADDY LEONARD: What am I to do about my rates and taxes?</p>
<p>BLOOM: Pay them, my friend.</p>
<p>PADDY LEONARD: Thank you.</p>
<p>NOSEY FLYNN: Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Obdurately)</i> Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.</p>
<p>J. J. O'MOLLOY: A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!</p>

<p>BLOOM: <i>(Coldly)</i> You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.</p>
<p>CROFTON: This is indeed a festivity.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Solemnly)</i> You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER KEYES: When will we have our own house of keys?</p>
<p>BLOOM: I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal language with universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free rent, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.</p>
<p>O'MADDEN BURKE: Free fox in a free henroost.</p>
<p>DAVY BYRNE: <i>(Yawning)</i> Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!</p>
<p>BLOOM: Mixed races and mixed marriage.</p>
<p>LENEHAN: What about mixed bathing?</p>

<p>FATHER FARLEY: He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an anythingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.</p>
<p>MRS RIORDAN: <i>(Tears up her will)</i> I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!</p>
<p>MOTHER GROGAN: <i>(Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom)</i> You beast! You abominable person!</p>

<p>LENEHAN: Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!</p>
<p>THE VEILED SIBYL: <i>(Enthusiastically)</i> I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Winks at the bystanders)</i> I bet she's a bonny lassie.</p>
<p>THEODORE PUREFOY: <i>(In fishingcap and oilskin jacket)</i> He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.</p>

<p class="c3">(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gasovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)</p>
<p>ALEXANDER J DOWIE: <i>(Violently)</i> Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!</p>
<p>THE MOB: Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!</p>
<p class="c3">(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheep's tails, odd pieces of fat.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Excitedly)</i> This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, <i>sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall.</i> I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf.</p>
<p>DR MULLIGAN: <i>(In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow)</i> Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be <i>virgo intacta.</i></p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)</p>
<p>DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.</p>
<p>DR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.</p>
<p>DR PUNCH COSTELLO: The <i>fetor judaicus</i> is most perceptible.</p>
<p>DR DIXON: <i>(Reads a bill of health)</i> Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.</p>
<p class="c3">(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, blank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I. O. U's, wedding rings, watchchains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: O, I so want to be a mother.</p>
<p>MRS THORNTON: <i>(In nursetender's gown)</i> Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All the octuplets are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindoree, Silversmile, Silberselber, Vifargent, Panargyros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vicechairmen of hotel syndicates.)</p>
<p>A VOICE: Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?</p>

<p>BANTAM LYONS: Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the top ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from king's evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Kossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)</p>

<p>BLOOM: <i>(Repentantly)</i> I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Glibly)</i> Hog's Norton where the pigs plays the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. <i>(She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple)</i> I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Smiles, nods slowly)</i> More, houri, more.</p>
<p>ZOE: And more's mother? <i>(She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws)</i> Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears)</i> Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. <i>(Earnestly)</i> You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Flattered)</i> What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. <i>(She pats him)</i> Come.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.</p>
<p>ZOE: Babby!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue lolling and lisping)</i> One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.</p>
<p>THE BUCKLES: Love me. Love me not. Love me.</p>
<p>ZOE: Silent means consent. <i>(With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the passtouch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.)</i> Hot hands cold gizzard.</p>
<p class="c3">(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)</p>
<p>THE MALE BRUTES: <i>(Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro)</i> Good!</p>
<p class="c3">(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Her lucky hand instantly saving him)</i> Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.</p>
<p>BLOOM: The just man falls seven times. <i>(He stands aside at the threshold)</i> After you is good manners.</p>
<p>ZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after.</p>
<p class="c3">(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the antlered rack of the hall hang a man 's hat and waterproof. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is flung open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an ape's gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)</p>
<p>KITTY: <i>(Coughs behind her hand)</i> She's a bit imbecillic. <i>(She signs with a waggling forefinger)</i> Blemblem. <i>(Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with his wand she settles them down quickly.)</i> Respect yourself. <i>(She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna)</i> O, excuse!</p>
<p>ZOE: More limelight, Charley. <i>(She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock)</i></p>
<p>KITTY: <i>(Peers at the gasjet)</i> What ails it tonight?</p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(Deeply)</i> Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.</p>
<p>ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.</p>
<p class="c3">(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)</p>
<p>KITTY: <i>(Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot)</i> O, excuse!</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Promptly)</i> Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.</p>
<p class="c3">(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)</p>
<p>STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate <i>Coela enarrant gloriam Domini.</i> It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of his almightiness. <i>Mais nom de nom,</i> that is another pair of trousers. <i>Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs)</i> Which side is your knowledge bump?</p>
<p>THE CAP: <i>(With saturnine spleen)</i> Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!</p>
<p>STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!</p>
<p>THE CAP: Bah!</p>
<p>STEPHEN: Here's another for you. <i>(He frowns)</i> The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which...</p>
<p>THE CAP: Which? Finish. You can't.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(With an effort)</i> Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.</p>
<p>THE CAP: Which?</p>
<p><i>(Outside the gramophone begins to blare</i> The Holy City.)</p>
<p>STEPHEN: <i>(Abruptly)</i> What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. <i>Ecco!</i></p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins)</i> What a learned speech, eh?</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Briskly)</i> God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.</p>
<p class="c3">(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)</p>
<p>FLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer.</p>
<p>KITTY: No!</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Explodes in laughter)</i> Great unjust God!</p>
<p>FLORRY: <i>(Offended)</i> Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist. O, my foot's tickling.</p>
<p class="c3">(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patter past, yelling.)</p>
<p>THE NEWSBOYS: Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.</p>
<p class="c3">(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)</p>
<p>STEPHEN: A time, times and half a time.</p>
<p class="c3">(Reuben I Antichrist, wandering jew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrim's wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)</p>
<p>ALL: What?</p>
<p>THE HOBGOBLIN: <i>(His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux sont faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks) Rien va plus! (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)</i></p>
<p>FLORRY: <i>(Sinking into torpor, crossing herself secretly)</i> The end of the world!</p>
<p class="c3">(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)</p>
<p>THE GRAMOPHONE: Jerusalem!</p>
<p>Open your gates and sing</p>
<p>Hosanna...</p>
<p class="c3">(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star fills from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tightrope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a twoheaded octopus in gillie's kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the form of the Three Legs of Man.)</p>
<p>THE END OF THE WORLD: <i>(with a Scotch accent)</i> Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?</p>
<p class="c3">(Over the possing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrake's, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergerfaced, above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)</p>
<p>ELIJAH: No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dove Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here. Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and, getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O. K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time.

<p>THE THREE WHORES: <i>(Covering their ears, squawk)</i> Ahhkkk!</p>
<p>ELIJAH: <i>(In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted)</i> Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. <i>(He winks at his audience)</i> Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he aint saying nothing.</p>
<p>KITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in the brown scapular. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.</p>
<p>ZOE-FANNY: I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.</p>
<p>FLORRY-TERESA: It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three star. I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.</p>
<p>STEPHEN: In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.</p>
<p class="c3">(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fist past in noisy marching)</p>
<p>THE BEATITUDES: <i>(Incoherently)</i> Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.</p>
<p>LYSTER: <i>(In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly)</i> He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.</p>
<p class="c3">(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser's attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizardlettered, and a high pagoda hat.)</p>
<p>BEST: <i>(Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot)</i> I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know, Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says.</p>
<p>JOHN EGLINTON: <i>(Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner: with carping accent)</i> Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.</p>
<p class="c3">(In the cone of the searchlight behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaun Maclir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mouth. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)</p>
<p>MANANAUN MACLIR: <i>(With a voice of waves)</i> Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. <i>(With a voice of whistling seawind)</i> Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. <i>(With a cry of stormbirds)</i> Shakti Shiva, darkhidden Father! <i>(He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its cooperative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.)</i> Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead! I am the dreamery creamery butter.</p>
<p class="c3">(A skeleton judashand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)</p>
<p>THE GASJET: Pooah! Pfuiiiiiii!</p>
<p class="c3">(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)</p>
<p>ZOE: Who has a fag as I'm here?</p>
<p>LYNCH: <i>(Tossing a cigarette on to the table)</i> Here.</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Her head perched aside in mock pride)</i> Is that the way to hand the <i>pot</i> to a lady? <i>(She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.)</i> Can you see the beautyspot of my behind?</p>
<p>LYNCH: I'm not looking</p>
<p>ZOE: <i>(Makes sheep's eyes)</i> No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?</p>
<p class="c3">(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(Heels together, bows)</i> My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. <i>(He coughs thoughtfully, drily)</i> Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Granpapachi. But...</p>
<p>VIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?</p>
<p>BLOOM: She is rather lean.</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(Not unpleasantly)</i> Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! <i>(With a nervous twitch of his head)</i> Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek)</i> She seems sad.</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely)</i> Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. <i>(More genially)</i> Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Regretfully)</i> When you come out without your gun.</p>
<p>VIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...</p>
<p>BLOOM: With...?</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(His tongue upcurling)</i> Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation, which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. <i>(His throat twitches)</i> Slapbang! There he goes again.</p>
<p>BLOOM: The stye I dislike.</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(Arches his eyebrows)</i> Contact with a goldring, they say. <i>Argumentum ad feminam</i>, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. <i>(He twitches)</i> It is a funny sound. <i>(He coughs encouragingly)</i> But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Reflecting)</i> Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking)</i> Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. <i>La causa &#232; santa</i>. Tara. Tara. <i>(Aside)</i> He will surely remember.</p>
<p>BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(Excitedly)</i> I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. <i>(He taps his parchmentroll energetically)</i> This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? <i>(With a dry snigger)</i> You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1886 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? <i>(He crows derisively)</i> Keekeereekee!</p>
<p class="c3">(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)</p>
<p>BLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then morrow as now was be past yester.</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(Prompts in a pig's whisper)</i> Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous fumale possessing extendified pudendal nerve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! <i>(His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally)</i> They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. <i>(He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand)</i> You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L.B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! <i>(He blows into bloom's ear)</i> Buzz!</p>
<p>BLOOM: Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key)</i> Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. <i>(He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles)</i> Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! <i>(He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws)</i> Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. <i>(He wags his head with cackling raillery)</i> Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular. <i>(He sneezes)</i> Amen!</p>
<p>BLOOM: <i>(Absently)</i> Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradicts. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone)</i> That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the the known...</p>
<p>BLOOM: I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. <i>(He repeats)</i> Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. <i>(Profoundly)</i> Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.</p>
<p>VIRAG: <i>(Head askew, arches his back and hunched wingshoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a horning claw and cries)</i> Who's moth moth? Who's dear Gerald? Dear Ger, that you? O dear, he is Gerald. O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? <i>(He mews)</i> Puss puss puss puss! <i>(He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw)</i> Well, well. He doth rest anon. (He snaps his jaws suddenly on the air)</p>
