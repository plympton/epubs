<p>So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.</p>
<p>&#8212;And there's more where that came from, says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.</p>
<p>&#8212;I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.</p>
<p>Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.</p>
<p>&#8212;For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. <i>The Irish Independent,</i> if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the <i>Irish all for Ireland Independent,</i> and I'll thank you and the marriages.</p>
<p>And he starts reading them out:</p>
<p>&#8212;Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...</p>
<p>&#8212;I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.</p>
<p>&#8212;Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?</p>
<p>&#8212;Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.</p>
<p>&#8212;I will, says he, honourable person.</p>
<p>&#8212;Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.</p>
<p>Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.</p>
<p>And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.</p>
<p>Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.</p>
<p>&#8212;Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...</p>
<p>And he doubled up.</p>
<p>&#8212;Take a what? says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.</p>
<p>&#8212;O hell! says I.</p>
<p>The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.</p>
<p><i>&#8212;Bi i dho husht,</i> says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.</p>
<p>&#8212;When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...</p>
<p>And he started laughing.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?</p>
<p>&#8212;Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.</p>
<p>Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.</p>
<p>Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.</p>
<p>But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?</p>
<p>&#8212;What's that? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.</p>
<p>So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8212;Are you codding? says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.</p>
<p>So Joe took up the letters.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.</p>
<p>So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:</p>
<p>&#8212;How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?</p>
<p>&#8212;I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...</p>
<p>&#8212;You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?</p>
<p>&#8212;With Dignam, says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;Is it Paddy? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, says Alf. Why?</p>
<p>&#8212;Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who's dead? says Bob Doran.</p>
<p>&#8212;You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.</p>
<p>&#8212;What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?</p>
<p>&#8212;What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?</p>
<p>&#8212;Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.</p>
<p>&#8212;Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.</p>
<p>&#8212;Paddy? says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.</p>
<p>&#8212;Good Christ! says Alf.</p>
<p>Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.</p>
<p>In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: <i>We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on.</i> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.</p>
<p>Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.</p>
<p>He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.</p>
<p>&#8212;There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who? says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.</p>
<p>And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.</p>
<p>Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.</p>
<p>&#8212;Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.</p>
<p>And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:</p>
<p>&#8212;Who said Christ is good?</p>
<p>&#8212;I beg your parsnips, says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?</p>
<p>&#8212;Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.</p>
<p>But Bob Doran shouts out of him.</p>
<p>&#8212;He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.</p>
<p>Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.</p>
<p>&#8212;The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.</p>
<p>The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.</p>
<p>&#8212;The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.</p>
<p>And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.</p>
<p>Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.</p>
<p>So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?</p>
<p>And he starts reading out one.</p>
<p class="c3">7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.</p>
<p class="c3">Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...</p>
<p>&#8212;Show us, Joe, says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...</i></p>
<p>&#8212;Jesus, says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...</i></p>
<p>The citizen made a grab at the letter.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hold hard, says Joe, <i>i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.</i></p>
<p class="c3">H. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.</p>
<p>&#8212;And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.</p>
<p>&#8212;And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?</p>
<p>So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.</p>
<p>&#8212;Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.</p>
<p>And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.</p>
<p>&#8212;They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.</p>
<p>And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.</p>
<p>In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.</p>
<p>So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>&#8212;There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's that? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;That so? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in</p>
<p>Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.</p>
<p>&#8212;That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...</p>
<p>And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.</p>
<p>The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the <i>corpora cavernosa</i> to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection <i>in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.</i></p>
<p>So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:</p>
<p>&#8212;Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!</p>
<p>Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.</p>
<p>And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the <i>City Arms</i> pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b&#233;zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his <i>but don't you see?</i> and <i>but on the other hand</i>. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!</p>
<p>&#8212;The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, ay, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Sinn Fein!</i> says the citizen. <i>Sinn Fein amhain!</i> The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.</p>
<p>The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang <i>The Night before Larry was stretched</i> in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed <i>doyen</i> of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit&#233;patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir&#225;ga Kis&#225;szony Putr&#225;pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.</p>
<p>Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the <i>Gladiolus Cruentus</i>. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate&#8212;short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, <i>hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah</i>, amid which the ringing <i>evviva</i> of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The <i>nec</i> and <i>non plus ultra</i> of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly <i>Sheila, my own</i>. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing <i>fianc&#233;e</i> an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate <i>entourage,</i> to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:</p>
<p>&#8212;God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.</p>
<p>So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.</p>
<p>So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.</p>
<p>&#8212;Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.</p>
<p>So he calls the old dog over.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's on you, Garry? says he.</p>
<p>Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter <i>pro bono publico</i> to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.</p>
<p>All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the <i>sobriquet</i> of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a <i>striking</i> resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>The curse of my curses<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Seven days every day<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And seven dry Thursdays<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On you, Barney Kiernan,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Has no sup of water<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To cool my courage,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And my guts red roaring<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After Lowry's lights.</i>
</div>
<p>So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.</p>
<p>&#8212;I will, says he, <i>a chara</i>, to show there's no ill feeling.</p>
<p>Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:</p>
<p>&#8212;Could you make a hole in another pint?</p>
<p>&#8212;Could a swim duck? says I.</p>
<p>&#8212;Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.</p>
<p>&#8212;Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.</p>
<p>&#8212;Whose admirers? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.</p>
<p>Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.</p>
<p>So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.</p>
<p>&#8212;Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.</p>
<p>&#8212;Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.</p>
<p>And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. <i>How is your testament? Have you got an old testament?</i> Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.</p>
<p>So Terry brought the three pints.</p>
<p>&#8212;Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Slan leat</i>, says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.</p>
<p>Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Friend of yours, says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?</p>
<p>&#8212;I won't mention any names, says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.</p>
<p>So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.</p>
<p>Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.</p>
<p>&#8212;Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.</p>
<p>&#8212;Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.</p>
<p>&#8212;That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?</p>
<p>&#8212;Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? <i>The Sluagh na h-Eireann</i>.</p>
<p>Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?</p>
<p>Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?</p>
<p>Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.</p>
<p>Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)</p>
<p>Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.</p>
<p>Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.</p>
<p>(Ironical opposition cheers.)</p>
<p>The speaker: Order! Order!</p>
<p>(The house rises. Cheers.)</p>
<p>&#8212;There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Na bacleis</i>, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.</p>
<p>&#8212;Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.</p>
<p>&#8212;Is that really a fact? says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?</p>
<p>So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: <i>Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw</i>. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.</p>
<p>A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of <i>Brian O'ciarnain's</i> in <i>Sraid na Bretaine Bheag</i>, under the auspices of <i>Sluagh na h-Eireann</i>, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) <i>A nation once again</i> in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.</p>
<p>Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.</p>
<p>&#8212;Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?</p>
<p>&#8212;No, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who? Blazes? says Joe.</p>
<p>And says Bloom:</p>
<p>&#8212;What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.</p>
<p>&#8212;We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8212;-True for you, says Joe.</p>
<p>And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:</p>
<p>&#8212;Now, don't you think, Bergan?</p>
<p>&#8212;Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.</p>
<p>It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.</p>
<p>&#8212;He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.</p>
<p>&#8212;He is, says Joe. Isn't he?</p>
<p>&#8212;Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.</p>
<p>&#8212;Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.</p>
<p>He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.</p>
<p>Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.</p>
<p>Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.</p>
<p>And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Ned.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Alf.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Jack.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;God save you, says the citizen.</p>
<p>&#8212;Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?</p>
<p>&#8212;Half one, says Ned.</p>
<p>So J. J. ordered the drinks.</p>
<p>&#8212;Were you round at the court? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hope so, says Ned.</p>
<p>Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.</p>
<p>&#8212;Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.</p>
<p>&#8212;Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.</p>
<p>&#8212;Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.</p>
<p>&#8212;Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.</p>
<p>&#8212;Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not <i>compos mentis</i>. U. p: up.</p>
<p><i>&#8212;Compos</i> your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.</p>
<p>&#8212;Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.</p>
<p>&#8212;How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...</p>
<p>&#8212;Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.</p>
<p>&#8212;Nor good red herring, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.</p>
<p>Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.</p>
<p>&#8212;And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.</p>
<p>Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.</p>
<p>&#8212;Good health, Ned, says J. J.</p>
<p>&#8212;-There he is again, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Where? says Alf.</p>
<p>And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.</p>
<p>&#8212;How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Remanded, says J. J.</p>
<p>One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who tried the case? says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Recorder, says Ned.</p>
<p>&#8212;Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.</p>
<p>&#8212;Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.</p>
<p>And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:</p>
<p>&#8212;A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.</p>
<p>&#8212;And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.</p>
<p>And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition <i>in re</i> the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.</p>
<p>&#8212;Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.</p>
<p>So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.</p>
<p>&#8212;Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.</p>
<p>&#8212;Rely on me, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.</p>
<p>&#8212;Consider that done, says Joe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Very kind of you, says Bloom.</p>
<p>&#8212;The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.</p>
<p>&#8212;Decree <i>nisi,</i> says J. J.</p>
<p>And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.</p>
<p>&#8212;A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.</p>
<p>&#8212;And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the <i>Police Gazette</i> with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.</p>
<p>&#8212;Give us a squint at her, says I.</p>
<p>And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.</p>
<p>&#8212;O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!</p>
<p>&#8212;There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?</p>
<p>So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?</p>
<p>O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.</p>
<p>&#8212;It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <i>patois.</i></p>
<p>So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.</p>
<p>&#8212;Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.</p>
<p>&#8212;The European family, says J. J....</p>
<p>&#8212;They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a <i>cabinet d'aisance.</i></p>
<p>And says John Wyse:</p>
<p>&#8212;Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.</p>
<p>And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!</i></p>
<p>He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan <i>Lamh Dearg Abu</i>, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.</p>
<p>&#8212;Gold cup, says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.</p>
<p><i>&#8212;Throwaway,</i> says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.</p>
<p>&#8212;And Bass's mare? says Terry.</p>
<p>&#8212;Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip <i>Sceptre</i> for himself and a lady friend.</p>
<p>&#8212;I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on <i>Zinfandel</i> that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.</p>
<p>&#8212;Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. <i>Throwaway,</i> says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is <i>Sceptre.</i></p>
<p>So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.</p>
<p>&#8212;Not there, my child, says he.</p>
<p>&#8212;Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.</p>
<p>And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.</p>
<p>&#8212;Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Raimeis</i>, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?</p>
<p>&#8212;As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...</p>
<p>&#8212;Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.</p>
<p>&#8212;Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.</p>
<p>The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty <i>motif</i> of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of <i>Woodman, spare that tree</i> at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre <i>in Horto</i> after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.</p>
