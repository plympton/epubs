<p>The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:</p>
<p>&#8212;Barang!</p>
<p>Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He halted near his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8212;It's time for you, she said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!</p>
<p>Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.</p>
<p>&#8212;Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?</p>
<p>He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.</p>
<p>&#8212;Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.</p>
<p>&#8212;Did you get any money? Dilly asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.</p>
<p>&#8212;You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8212;How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.</p>
<p>Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James's street.</p>
<p>&#8212;I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?</p>
<p>&#8212;I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.</p>
<p>He handed her a shilling.</p>
<p>&#8212;See if you can do anything with that, he said.</p>
<p>&#8212;I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.</p>
<p>&#8212;Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.</p>
<p>He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.</p>
<p>&#8212;Well, what is it? he said, stopping.</p>
<p>The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.</p>
<p>&#8212;Barang!</p>
<p>&#8212;Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.</p>
<p>The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:</p>
<p>&#8212;Bang!</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus stared at him.</p>
<p>&#8212;Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.</p>
<p>&#8212;You got more than that, father, Dilly said.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.</p>
<p>He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.</p>
<p>&#8212;Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8212;I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell street. I'll try this one now.</p>
<p>&#8212;You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.</p>
<p>&#8212;Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.</p>
<p>He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.</p>
<p>The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.</p>
<p>The lacquey banged loudly.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:</p>
<p>&#8212;The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!</p>
<hr>
<p>From the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.</p>
<p>I smiled at him. <i>America,</i> I said quietly, just like that. <i>What is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true?</i> That's a fact.</p>
<p>Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's always someone to pick it up.</p>
<p>Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.</p>
<p>Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.</p>
<p>Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.</p>
<p>North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.</p>
<p>Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him.</p>
<p>Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.</p>
<p>Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove by in her noddy.</p>
<p>Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too. Fourbottle men.</p>
<p>Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a detour.</p>
<p>Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.</p>
<p>Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.</p>
<p>Mr Kernan approached Island street.</p>
<p>Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.</p>
<p>Damn good gin that was.</p>
<p>Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.</p>
<p class="c3">At the siege of Ross did my father fall.</p>
<p>A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.</p>
<p>Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.</p>
<p>His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!</p>
<hr>
<p>Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.</p>
<p>Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.</p>
<p>She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.</p>
<p>Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.</p>
<p>And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.</p>
<p>Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.</p>
<p>The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.</p>
<p>Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.</p>
<p>Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.</p>
<p>He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.</p>
<p>&#8212;Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.</p>
<p>Tattered pages. <i>The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur&#233; of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney.</i></p>
<p>I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. <i>Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.</i></p>
<p>Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.</p>
<p>Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.</i></p>
<p>Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.</p>
<p>&#8212;What are you doing here, Stephen?</p>
<p>Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.</p>
<p>Shut the book quick. Don't let see.</p>
<p>&#8212;What are you doing? Stephen said.</p>
<p>A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. <i>Nebrakada femininum.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;What have you there? Stephen asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good?</p>
<p>My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind.</p>
<p>He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.</p>
<p>&#8212;What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?</p>
<p>She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.</p>
<p>Show no surprise. Quite natural.</p>
<p>&#8212;Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone.</p>
<p>&#8212;Some, Dilly said. We had to.</p>
<p>She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.</p>
<p>We.</p>
<p>Agenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.</p>
<p>Misery! Misery!</p>
<hr>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?</p>
<p>&#8212;Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.</p>
<p>They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.</p>
<p>&#8212;Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?</p>
<p>&#8212;O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#8212;With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.</p>
<p>He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.</p>
<p>&#8212;I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!</p>
<p>He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.</p>
<p>&#8212;There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.</p>
<p>Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.</p>
<p>As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:</p>
<p>&#8212;Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:</p>
<p>&#8212;That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?</p>
<p>&#8212;Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.</p>
<p>He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:</p>
<p>&#8212;They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.</p>
<p>&#8212;Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God he's not paid yet.</p>
<p>&#8212;And how is that <i>basso profondo</i>, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.</p>
<p>Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.</p>
<p>Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a deep note.</p>
<p>&#8212;Aw! he said.</p>
<p>&#8212;That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.</p>
<p>&#8212;What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?</p>
<p>He turned to both.</p>
<p>&#8212;That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.</p>
<p>The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.</p>
<p>Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.</p>
<p>&#8212;For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.</p>
<p>Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.</p>
<p>&#8212;What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?</p>
<p>&#8212;He has, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?</p>
<p>&#8212;That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?</p>
<p>&#8212;You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.</p>
<p>He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.</p>
<p>&#8212;Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#8212;The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.</p>
<p>The policeman touched his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8212;God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.</p>
<p>He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.</p>
<p>Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.</p>
<p>&#8212;You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.</p>
<p>&#8212;Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.</p>
<p>John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.</p>
<p>On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.</p>
<p>The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.</p>
<p>&#8212;Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the <i>Mail</i> office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.</p>
<p>&#8212;Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too.</p>
<p>&#8212;Without a second word either, Mr Power said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.</p>
<p>John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.</p>
<p>They went down Parliament street.</p>
<p>&#8212;There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.</p>
<p>&#8212;Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.</p>
<p>Outside <i>la Maison Claire</i> Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.</p>
<p>John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.</p>
<p>&#8212;The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.</p>
<p>They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.</p>
<p>&#8212;And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.</p>
<p>The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.</p>
<p>&#8212;Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.</p>
<p>Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.</p>
<p>&#8212;Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.</p>
<p>Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing <i>locum tenens</i> for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.</p>
<p>Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.</p>
<p>Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.</p>
<p>&#8212;What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.</p>
<p>Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!</p>
<p>Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and passed in and up the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8212;Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.</p>
<p>With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.</p>
<p>&#8212;Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.</p>
<p>&#8212;Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p>Long John Fanning could not remember him.</p>
<p>Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's that? Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p>All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.</p>
<p>&#8212;What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.</p>
<p>&#8212;The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.</p>
<hr>
<p>As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:</p>
<p>&#8212;Parnell's brother. There in the corner.</p>
<p>They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.</p>
<p>&#8212;Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.</p>
<p>&#8212;Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.</p>
<p>John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll take a <i>m&#233;lange,</i> Haines said to the waitress.</p>
<p>&#8212;Two <i>m&#233;langes,</i> Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.</p>
<p>When she had gone he said, laughing:</p>
<p>&#8212;We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed Dedalus on <i>Hamlet.</i></p>
<p>Haines opened his newbought book.</p>
<p>&#8212;I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.</p>
<p>The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>England expects</i>...</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.</p>
<p>&#8212;You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering Aengus I call him.</p>
<p>&#8212;I am sure he has an <i>id&#233;e fixe,</i> Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.</p>
<p>&#8212;They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation...</p>
<p>&#8212;Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.</p>
<p>Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.</p>
<p>&#8212;He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement?</p>
<p>He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.</p>
<p>&#8212;Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in ten years.</p>
<p>&#8212;Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.</p>
<p>He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.</p>
<p>&#8212;This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't want to be imposed on.</p>
<p>Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner <i>Rosevean</i> from Bridgwater with bricks.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.</p>
<p>Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.</p>
<p>At the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>Coactus volui.</i></p>
<p>He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.</p>
<p>As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.</p>
<p>&#8212;God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder nor I am, you bitch's bastard!</p>
<hr>
<p>Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.</p>
<p>After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.</p>
<p>Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.</p>
<p>In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.</p>
<p>No Sandymount tram.</p>
<p>Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.</p>
<p>His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.</p>
<p>Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.</p>
<hr>
<p>William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.</p>
<p>The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, <i>dernier cri</i> James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming <i>soubrette,</i> great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of <i>My girl's a Yorkshire girl.</i></p>
<p>Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the <i>cort&#232;ge</i>:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>But though she's a factory lass<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And wears no fancy clothes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Baraabum.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Yet I've a sort of a<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Yorkshire relish for<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; My little Yorkshire rose.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Baraabum.</i>
</div>
<p>Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door.</p>

<p>Bronze by gold, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.</p>
<p>&#8212;Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.</p>
<p>Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and <i>eau de Nil.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p>When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:</p>
<p>&#8212;Look at the fellow in the tall silk.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8212;In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the sun.</p>
<p>He's looking. Mind till I see.</p>
<p>She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.</p>
<p>Her wet lips tittered:</p>
<p>&#8212;He's killed looking back.</p>
<p>She laughed:</p>
<p>&#8212;O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?</p>
<p>With sadness.</p>
<p>Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.</p>
<p>Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.</p>
<p>&#8212;It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.</p>
<p>A man.</p>
<p>Bloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.</p>
<p>The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And</p>
<p>&#8212;There's your teas, he said.</p>
<p>Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.</p>
<p>&#8212;What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.</p>
<p>&#8212;Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.</p>
<p>&#8212;Your <i>beau,</i> is it?</p>
<p>A haughty bronze replied:</p>
<p>&#8212;I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.</p>
<p>&#8212;Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come.</p>
<p>Bloom.</p>
<p>On her flower frowning miss Douce said:</p>
<p>&#8212;Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.</p>
<p>Ladylike in exquisite contrast.</p>
<p>&#8212;Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.</p>
<p>She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.</p>
<p>Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.</p>
<p>&#8212;Am I awfully sunburnt?</p>
<p>Miss bronze unbloused her neck.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?</p>
<p>Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.</p>
<p>&#8212;And leave it to my hands, she said.</p>
<p>&#8212;Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.</p>
<p>Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce</p>
<p>&#8212;Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.</p>
<p>Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:</p>
<p>&#8212;O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!</p>
<p>&#8212;But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.</p>
<p>Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, don't, she cried.</p>
<p>&#8212;I won't listen, she cried.</p>
<p>But Bloom?</p>
<p>Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:</p>
<p>&#8212;For your what? says he.</p>
<p>Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:</p>
<p>&#8212;Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.</p>
<p>She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.</p>
<p>&#8212;Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!</p>
<p>Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.</p>
<p>&#8212;O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?</p>
<p>Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:</p>
<p>&#8212;And your other eye!</p>
<p>Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name. By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.</p>
<p>By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.</p>
<p>Of sin.</p>
<p>In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.</p>
<p>Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.</p>
<p>Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:</p>
<p>&#8212;O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. With his bit of beard!</p>
<p>Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.</p>
<p>&#8212;Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.</p>
<p>Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.</p>
<p>Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.</p>
<p>&#8212;O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished</p>
<p>I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!</p>
<p>And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.</p>
<p>By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.</p>
<p>Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.</p>
<p>Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.</p>
<p>&#8212;O, welcome back, miss Douce.</p>
<p>He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?</p>
<p>&#8212;Tiptop.</p>
<p>He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.</p>
<p>&#8212;Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.</p>
<p>Bronze whiteness.</p>
<p>&#8212;That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.</p>
<p>Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.</p>
<p>&#8212;O go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.</p>
<p>He was.</p>
<p>&#8212;Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.</p>
<p>&#8212;You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?</p>
<p>&#8212;Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.</p>
<p>Jingle.</p>
<p>&#8212;With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.</p>
<p>With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.</p>
<p>&#8212;By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.</p>
<p>None nought said nothing. Yes.</p>
<p>Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!</i></p>
<p>&#8212;Was Mr Lidwell in today?</p>
<p>In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on the rye.</p>
<p>&#8212;He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.</p>
<p>Lenehan came forward.</p>
<p>&#8212;Was Mr Boylan looking for me?</p>
<p>He asked. She answered:</p>
<p>&#8212;Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?</p>
<p>She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:</p>
<p>&#8212;No. He was not.</p>
<p>Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.</p>
<p>&#8212;Peep! Who's in the corner?</p>
<p>No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.</p>
<p>Jingle jaunty jingle.</p>
<p>Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:</p>
<p>&#8212;Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?</p>
<p>He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.</p>
<p>He sighed aside:</p>
<p>&#8212;Ah me! O my!</p>
<p>He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.</p>
<p>&#8212;Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.</p>
<p>&#8212;Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p>Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?</p>
<p>&#8212;Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.</p>
<p>Dry.</p>
<p>Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.</p>
<p>&#8212;I see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?</p>
<p>He had.</p>
<p>&#8212;I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In Mooney's <i>en ville</i> and in Mooney's <i>sur mer.</i> He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.</p>
<p>He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:</p>
<p>&#8212;The <i>&#233;lite</i> of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh</p>
<p>MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O'Madden Burke.</p>
<p>After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and</p>
<p>&#8212;That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.</p>
<p>He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.</p>
<p>He looked towards the saloon door.</p>
<p>&#8212;I see you have moved the piano.</p>
<p>&#8212;The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.</p>
<p>&#8212;Is that a fact?</p>
<p>&#8212;Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.</p>
<p>&#8212;Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p>He drank and strayed away.</p>
<p>&#8212;So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.</p>
<p>God's curse on bitch's bastard.</p>
<p>Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.</p>
<p>With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.</p>
<p>Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.</p>
<p>Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.</p>
<p>Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.</p>
<p>&#8212;Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.</p>
<p>&#8212;Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...</p>
<p>&#8212;And four.</p>
<p>At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.</p>
<p>For men.</p>
<p>In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.</p>
<p>From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.</p>
<p>Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss</p>
<p>Douce.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>The bright stars fade</i>...</p>
<p>A voiceless song sang from within, singing:</p>
<p>&#8212;... <i>the morn is breaking.</i></p>
<p>A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking, life's, love's morn.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>The dewdrops pearl</i>...</p>
<p>Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.</p>
<p>&#8212;But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.</p>
<p>Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.</p>
<p>She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.</p>
<p>&#8212;Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.</p>
<p>She answered, slighting:</p>
<p>&#8212;Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.</p>
<p>Like lady, ladylike.</p>
<p>Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:</p>
<p>&#8212;See the conquering hero comes.</p>
<p>Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>And I from thee</i>...</p>
<p>&#8212;I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p>He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.</p>
<p>Smart Boylan bespoke potions.</p>
<p>&#8212;What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?</p>
<p>Not yet. At four she. Who said four?</p>
<p>Cowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.</p>
<p>Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What, Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.</p>
<p>Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.</p>
<p>&#8212;O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!</p>
<p>But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.</p>
<p>&#8212;Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p>Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice:</p>
<p>&#8212;Fine goods in small parcels.</p>
<p>That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.</p>
<p>&#8212;Here's fortune, Blazes said.</p>
<p>He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.</p>
<p>&#8212;Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...</p>
<p>&#8212;Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.</p>
<p>&#8212;Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.</p>
<p>&#8212;I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.</p>
<p>Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.</p>
<p>Idolores. The eastern seas.</p>
<p>Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.</p>
<p>Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.</p>
<p>&#8212;What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?</p>
<p>O'clock.</p>
<p>Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve.</p>
<p>&#8212;Let's hear the time, he said.</p>
<p>The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.</p>
<p>Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.</p>
<p>&#8212;Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.</p>
<p>&#8212;... <i>to Flora's lips did hie.</i></p>
<p>High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.</p>
<p>Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought</p>
<p>Blazes Boylan's flower and eyes.</p>
<p>&#8212;Please, please.</p>
<p>He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>I could not leave thee</i>...</p>
<p>&#8212;Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, now, urged Lenehan. <i>Sonnezlacloche!</i> O do! There's no-one.</p>
<p>She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.</p>
<p>Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.</p>
<p>&#8212;Go on! Do! <i>Sonnez!</i></p>
<p>Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.</p>
<p class="c3">&#8212;Sonnez!</p>
<p>Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.</p>
<p>&#8212;<i>La Cloche!</i> cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.</p>
<p>She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.</p>
