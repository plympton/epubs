<h2 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Chapter 2</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station
of the Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of
people that day, when, looking round for the groom who was
following with their things, they saw a party of volunteers
driving up in four cabs. Ladies met them with bouquets of
flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the
station.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the
hall and addressed Sergey Ivanovitch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You too come to see them off?" she asked in French.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, I&#8217;m going away myself, princess. To my brother&#8217;s for a
holiday. Do you always see them off?" said Sergey Ivanovitch with
a hardly perceptible smile.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, that would be impossible!" answered the princess. "Is it
true that eight hundred have been sent from us already?
Malvinsky wouldn&#8217;t believe me."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"More than eight hundred. If you reckon those who have been sent
not directly from Moscow, over a thousand," answered Sergey
Ivanovitch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There! That&#8217;s just what I said!" exclaimed the lady. "And it&#8217;s
true too, I suppose, that more than a million has been
subscribed?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, princess."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What do you say to today&#8217;s telegram? Beaten the Turks again."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, so I saw," answered Sergey Ivanovitch. They were speaking
of the last telegram stating that the Turks had been for three
days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight, and
that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go,
and they&#8217;ve made some difficulty, I don&#8217;t know why. I meant to
ask you; I know him; please write a note about his case. He&#8217;s
being sent by Countess Lidia Ivanovna."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew
about the young man, and going into the first-class waiting-room,
wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of
absence depended, and handed it to the princess.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one ... is going by this
train?" said the princess with a smile full of triumph and
meaning, when he found her again and gave her the letter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I had heard he was going, but I did not know when. By this
train?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I&#8217;ve seen him. He&#8217;s here: there&#8217;s only his mother seeing him
off. It&#8217;s the best thing, anyway, that he could do."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, yes, of course."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the
dining room. They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with a
glass in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers.
"In the service of religion, humanity, and our brothers," the
gentleman said, his voice growing louder and louder; "to this
great cause mother Moscow dedicates you with her blessing.
</span><em class="italics">Jivio!</em><span>" he concluded, loudly and tearfully.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Everyone shouted </span><em class="italics">Jivio!</em><span> and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall,
almost carrying the princess off her legs.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah, princess! that was something like!" said Stepan
Arkadyevitch, suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and
beaming upon them with a delighted smile. "Capitally, warmly
said, wasn&#8217;t it? Bravo! And Sergey Ivanovitch! Why, you ought
to have said something&#8212;just a few words, you know, to encourage
them; you do that so well," he added with a soft, respectful, and
discreet smile, moving Sergey Ivanovitch forward a little by the
arm.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, I&#8217;m just off."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Where to?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"To the country, to my brother&#8217;s," answered Sergey Ivanovitch.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Then you&#8217;ll see my wife. I&#8217;ve written to her, but you&#8217;ll see
her first. Please tell her that they&#8217;ve seen me and that it&#8217;s
&#8216;all right,&#8217; as the English say. She&#8217;ll understand. Oh, and
be so good as to tell her I&#8217;m appointed secretary of the
committee.... But she&#8217;ll understand! You know, </span><em class="italics">les petites
mis&#232;res de la vie humaine,</em><span>" he said, as it were apologizing to
the princess. "And Princess Myakaya&#8212;not Liza, but Bibish&#8212;is
sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses. Did I tell you?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, I heard so," answered Koznishev indifferently.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It&#8217;s a pity you&#8217;re going away," said Stepan Arkadyevitch. "Tomorrow
we&#8217;re giving a dinner to two who&#8217;re setting off&#8212;Dimer-Bartnyansky
from Petersburg and our Veslovsky, Grisha. They&#8217;re both going.
Veslovsky&#8217;s only lately married. There&#8217;s a fine fellow for you! Eh,
princess?" he turned to the lady.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The princess looked at Koznishev without replying. But the fact
that Sergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid
of him did not in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch.
Smiling, he stared at the feather in the princess&#8217;s hat, and then
about him as though he were going to pick something up. Seeing a
lady approaching with a collecting box, he beckoned her up and
put in a five-rouble note.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I&#8217;ve money
in my pocket," he said. "And how about today&#8217;s telegram? Fine
chaps those Montenegrins!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You don&#8217;t say so!" he cried, when the princess told him that
Vronsky was going by this train. For an instant Stepan
Arkadyevitch&#8217;s face looked sad, but a minute later, when,
stroking his mustaches and swinging as he walked, he went into
the hall where Vronsky was, he had completely forgotten his own
despairing sobs over his sister&#8217;s corpse, and he saw in Vronsky
only a hero and an old friend.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"With all his faults one can&#8217;t refuse to do him justice," said
the princess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch
had left them. "What a typically Russian, Slav nature! Only,
I&#8217;m afraid it won&#8217;t be pleasant for Vronsky to see him. Say what
you will, I&#8217;m touched by that man&#8217;s fate. Do talk to him a
little on the way," said the princess.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, perhaps, if it happens so."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I never liked him. But this atones for a great deal. He&#8217;s not
merely going himself, he&#8217;s taking a squadron at his own expense."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, so I heard."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A bell sounded. Everyone crowded to the doors. "Here he is!" said
the princess, indicating Vronsky, who with his mother on his arm
walked by, wearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat.
Oblonsky was walking beside him, talking eagerly of something.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as though
he did not hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Probably on Oblonsky&#8217;s pointing them out, he looked round in the
direction where the princess and Sergey Ivanovitch were standing,
and without speaking lifted his hat. His face, aged and worn by
suffering, looked stony.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Going onto the platform, Vronsky left his mother and disappeared
into a compartment.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On the platform there rang out "God save the Tsar," then shouts
of "hurrah!" and </span><em class="italics">"jivio!"</em><span> One of the volunteers, a tall, very
young man with a hollow chest, was particularly conspicuous,
bowing and waving his felt hat and a nosegay over his head. Then
two officers emerged, bowing too, and a stout man with a big
beard, wearing a greasy forage cap.</span></p>
