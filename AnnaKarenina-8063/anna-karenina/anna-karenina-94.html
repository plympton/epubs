<h2 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Chapter 22</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span>It was six o&#8217;clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly,
and at the same time not to drive with his own horses, known to
everyone, Vronsky got into Yashvin&#8217;s hired fly, and told the
driver to drive as quickly as possible. It was a roomy,
old-fashioned fly, with seats for four. He sat in one corner,
stretched his legs out on the front seat, and sank into
meditation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been
brought, a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of
Serpuhovskoy, who had considered him a man that was needed, and
most of all, the anticipation of the interview before him&#8212;all
blended into a general, joyous sense of life. This feeling was
so strong that he could not help smiling. He dropped his legs,
crossed one leg over the other knee, and taking it in his hand,
felt the springy muscle of the calf, where it had been grazed the
day before by his fall, and leaning back he drew several deep
breaths.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I&#8217;m happy, very happy!" he said to himself. He had often before
had this sense of physical joy in his own body, but he had never
felt so fond of himself, of his own body, as at that moment. He
enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg, he enjoyed the
muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed. The
bright, cold August day, which had made Anna feel so hopeless,
seemed to him keenly stimulating, and refreshed his face and neck
that still tingled from the cold water. The scent of
brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly pleasant
in the fresh air. Everything he saw from the carriage window,
everything in that cold pure air, in the pale light of the
sunset, was as fresh, and gay, and strong as he was himself: the
roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun, the
sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings, the figures of
passers-by, the carriages that met him now and then, the
motionless green of the trees and grass, the fields with evenly
drawn furrows of potatoes, and the slanting shadows that fell
from the houses, and trees, and bushes, and even from the rows of
potatoes&#8212;everything was bright like a pretty landscape just
finished and freshly varnished.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Get on, get on!" he said to the driver, putting his head out of
the window, and pulling a three-rouble note out of his pocket he
handed it to the man as he looked round. The driver&#8217;s hand
fumbled with something at the lamp, the whip cracked, and the
carriage rolled rapidly along the smooth highroad.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I want nothing, nothing but this happiness," he thought,
staring at the bone button of the bell in the space between the
windows, and picturing to himself Anna just as he had seen her
last time. "And as I go on, I love her more and more. Here&#8217;s
the garden of the Vrede Villa. Whereabouts will she be? Where?
How? Why did she fix on this place to meet me, and why does she
write in Betsy&#8217;s letter?" he thought, wondering now for the first
time at it. But there was now no time for wonder. He called to
the driver to stop before reaching the avenue, and opening the
door, jumped out of the carriage as it was moving, and went into
the avenue that led up to the house. There was no one in the
avenue; but looking round to the right he caught sight of her.
Her face was hidden by a veil, but he drank in with glad eyes the
special movement in walking, peculiar to her alone, the slope of
the shoulders, and the setting of the head, and at once a sort of
electric shock ran all over him. With fresh force, he felt
conscious of himself from the springy motions of his legs to the
movements of his lungs as he breathed, and something set his lips
twitching.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Joining him, she pressed his hand tightly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You&#8217;re not angry that I sent for you? I absolutely had to see
you," she said; and the serious and set line of her lips, which
he saw under the veil, transformed his mood at once.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I angry! But how have you come, where from?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Never mind," she said, laying her hand on his, "come along, I
must talk to you."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He saw that something had happened, and that the interview would
not be a joyous one. In her presence he had no will of his own:
without knowing the grounds of her distress, he already felt the
same distress unconsciously passing over him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What is it? what?" he asked her, squeezing her hand with his
elbow, and trying to read her thoughts in her face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She walked on a few steps in silence, gathering up her courage;
then suddenly she stopped.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I did not tell you yesterday," she began, breathing quickly and
painfully, "that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told
him everything ... told him I could not be his wife, that ... and
told him everything."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He heard her, unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her
as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her
position for her. But directly she had said this he suddenly
drew himself up, and a proud and hard expression came over his
face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes, that&#8217;s better, a thousand times better! I know how
painful it was," he said. But she was not listening to his
words, she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his
face. She could not guess that that expression arose from the
first idea that presented itself to Vronsky&#8212;that a duel was now
inevitable. The idea of a duel had never crossed her mind, and
so she put a different interpretation on this passing expression
of hardness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she got her husband&#8217;s letter, she knew then at the bottom of
her heart that everything would go on in the old way, that she
would not have the strength of will to forego her position, to
abandon her son, and to join her lover. The morning spent at
Princess Tverskaya&#8217;s had confirmed her still more in this. But
this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her. She
hoped that this interview would transform her position, and save
her. If on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely,
passionately, without an instant&#8217;s wavering: "Throw up everything
and come with me!" she would give up her son and go away with
him. But this news had not produced what she had expected in
him; he simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It was not in the least painful to me. It happened of itself,"
she said irritably; "and see..." she pulled her husband&#8217;s letter
out of her glove.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I understand, I understand," he interrupted her, taking the
letter, but not reading it, and trying to soothe her. "The one
thing I longed for, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut
short this position, so as to devote my life to your happiness."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why do you tell me that?" she said. "Do you suppose I can doubt
it? If I doubted..."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Who&#8217;s that coming?" said Vronsky suddenly, pointing to two
ladies walking towards them. "Perhaps they know us!" and he
hurriedly turned off, drawing her after him into a side path.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, I don&#8217;t care!" she said. Her lips were quivering. And he
fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under
the veil. "I tell you that&#8217;s not the point&#8212;I can&#8217;t doubt that;
but see what he writes to me. Read it." She stood still again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Again, just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with
her husband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously
carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own
relation to the betrayed husband. Now while he held his letter
in his hands, he could not help picturing the challenge, which he
would most likely find at home today or tomorrow, and the duel
itself, in which, with the same cold and haughty expression that
his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured
husband&#8217;s shot, after having himself fired into the air. And at
that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what
Serpuhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had himself been
thinking in the morning&#8212;that it was better not to bind himself&#8212;and
he knew that this thought he could not tell her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Having read the letter, he raised his eyes to her, and there was
no determination in them. She saw at once that he had been
thinking about it before by himself. She knew that whatever he
might say to her, he would not say all he thought. And she knew
that her last hope had failed her. This was not what she had
been reckoning on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You see the sort of man he is," she said, with a shaking voice;
"he..."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Forgive me, but I rejoice at it," Vronsky interrupted. "For
God&#8217;s sake, let me finish!" he added, his eyes imploring her to
give him time to explain his words. "I rejoice, because things
cannot, cannot possibly remain as he supposes."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why can&#8217;t they?" Anna said, restraining her tears, and obviously
attaching no sort of consequence to what he said. She felt that
her fate was sealed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Vronsky meant that after the duel&#8212;inevitable, he thought&#8212;things
could not go on as before, but he said something different.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It can&#8217;t go on. I hope that now you will leave him. I hope"&#8212;he
was confused, and reddened&#8212;"that you will let me arrange and
plan our life. Tomorrow..." he was beginning.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She did not let him go on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But my child!" she shrieked. "You see what he writes! I should
have to leave him, and I can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t do that."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But, for God&#8217;s sake, which is better?&#8212;leave your child, or
keep up this degrading position?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"To whom is it degrading?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"To all, and most of all to you."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You say degrading ... don&#8217;t say that. Those words have no meaning
for me," she said in a shaking voice. She did not want him now
to say what was untrue. She had nothing left her but his love,
and she wanted to love him. "Don&#8217;t you understand that from the
day I loved you everything has changed for me? For me there is
one thing, and one thing only&#8212;your love. If that&#8217;s mine, I
feel so exalted, so strong, that nothing can be humiliating to
me. I am proud of my position, because ... proud of being ...
proud...." She could not say what she was proud of. Tears of
shame and despair choked her utterance. She stood still and
sobbed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching in
his nose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the point
of weeping. He could not have said exactly what it was touched
him so. He felt sorry for her, and he felt he could not help
her, and with that he knew that he was to blame for her
wretchedness, and that he had done something wrong.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Is not a divorce possible?" he said feebly. She shook her head,
not answering. "Couldn&#8217;t you take your son, and still leave
him?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes; but it all depends on him. Now I must go to him," she
said shortly. Her presentiment that all would again go on in the
old way had not deceived her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be
settled."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes," she said. "But don&#8217;t let us talk any more of it."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Anna&#8217;s carriage, which she had sent away, and ordered to come
back to the little gate of the Vrede garden, drove up. Anna said
good-bye to Vronsky, and drove home.</span></p>
