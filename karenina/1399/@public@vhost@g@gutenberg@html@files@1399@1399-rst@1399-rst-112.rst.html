<h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Chapter 7</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The next day was Sunday. Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand
Theater to a rehearsal of the ballet, and gave Masha Tchibisova,
a pretty dancing-girl whom he had just taken under his
protection, the coral necklace he had promised her the evening
before, and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater,
managed to kiss her pretty little face, radiant over her present.
Besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange with her
about meeting after the ballet. After explaining that he could
not come at the beginning of the ballet, he promised he would
come for the last act and take her to supper. From the theater
Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row, selected himself the
fish and asparagus for dinner, and by twelve o’clock was at
Dussot’s, where he had to see three people, luckily all staying
at the same hotel: Levin, who had recently come back from abroad
and was staying there; the new head of his department, who had
just been promoted to that position, and had come on a tour of
revision to Moscow; and his brother-in-law, Karenin, whom he must
see, so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining, but still better he liked to
give a dinner, small, but very choice, both as regards the
food and drink and as regards the selection of guests. He
particularly liked the program of that day’s dinner. There would
be fresh perch, asparagus, and </span><em class="italics">la pièce de resistance</em><span>—first-rate,
but quite plain, roast beef, and wines to suit: so much for the
eating and drinking. Kitty and Levin would be of the party, and
that this might not be obtrusively evident, there would be a girl
cousin too, and young Shtcherbatsky, and </span><em class="italics">la pièce de resistance</em><span>
among the guests—Sergey Koznishev and Alexey Alexandrovitch.
Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man, and a philosopher; Alexey
Alexandrovitch a Petersburger, and a practical politician. He was
asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast, Pestsov, a
liberal, a great talker, a musician, an historian, and the most
delightfully youthful person of fifty, who would be a sauce or
garnish for Koznishev and Karenin. He would provoke them and set
them off.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The second installment for the forest had been received from the
merchant and was not yet exhausted; Dolly had been very amiable
and goodhumored of late, and the idea of the dinner pleased
Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view. He was in the most
light-hearted mood. There were two circumstances a little
unpleasant, but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea
of good-humored gaiety which flooded the soul of Stepan
Arkadyevitch. These two circumstances were: first, that on
meeting Alexey Alexandrovitch the day before in the street he had
noticed that he was cold and reserved with him, and putting the
expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face and the fact that he
had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with the
rumors he had heard about Anna and Vronsky, Stepan Arkadyevitch
guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>That was one disagreeable thing. The other slightly disagreeable
fact was that the new head of his department, like all new heads,
had the reputation already of a terrible person, who got up at
six o’clock in the morning, worked like a horse, and insisted on
his subordinates working in the same way. Moreover, this new
head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners,
and was, according to all reports, a man of a class in all
respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had
belonged, and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had hitherto belonged
himself. On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had appeared at
the office in a uniform, and the new chief had been very affable
and had talked to him as to an acquaintance. Consequently Stepan
Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his
non-official dress. The thought that the new chief might not
tender him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing. But
Stepan Arkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would </span><em class="italics">come
round</em><span> all right. "They’re all people, all men, like us poor
sinners; why be nasty and quarrelsome?" he thought as he went
into the hotel.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Good-day, Vassily," he said, walking into the corridor with his
hat cocked on one side, and addressing a footman he knew; "why,
you’ve let your whiskers grow! Levin, number seven, eh? Take me
up, please. And find out whether Count Anitchkin" (this was the
new head) "is receiving."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sir," Vassily responded, smiling. "You’ve not been to see
us for a long while."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance. Is this
number seven?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the
room, measuring a fresh bearskin, when Stepan Arkadyevitch went
in.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What! you killed him?" cried Stepan Arkadyevitch. "Well done!
A she-bear? How are you, Arhip!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a
chair, without taking off his coat and hat.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come, take off your coat and stay a little," said Levin, taking
his hat.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, I haven’t time; I’ve only looked in for a tiny second,"
answered Stepan Arkadyevitch. He threw open his coat, but
afterwards did take it off, and sat on for a whole hour, talking
to Levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad? Where have you
been?" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when the peasant had gone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in England—not
in the capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and saw a great
deal that was new to me. And I’m glad I went."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question. In Russia
the question is that of the relation of the working people to the
land; though the question exists there too—but there it’s a
matter of repairing what’s been ruined, while with us..."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Stepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes!" he said, "it’s very possible you’re right. But I’m
glad you’re in good spirits, and are hunting bears, and working,
and interested. Shtcherbatsky told me another story—he met
you—that you were in such a depressed state, talking of nothing
but death...."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, what of it? I’ve not given up thinking of death," said
Levin. "It’s true that it’s high time I was dead; and that all
this is nonsense. It’s the truth I’m telling you. I do value
my idea and my work awfully; but in reality only consider this:
all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew, which
has grown up on a tiny planet. And for us to suppose we can have
something great—ideas, work—it’s all dust and ashes."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But all that’s as old as the hills, my boy!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then
somehow everything becomes of no consequence. When you
understand that you will die tomorrow, if not today, and nothing
will be left, then everything is so unimportant! And I consider
my idea very important, but it turns out really to be as
unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as doing for that
bear. So one goes on living, amusing oneself with hunting, with
work—anything so as not to think of death!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he
listened to Levin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, of course! Here you’ve come round to my point. Do you
remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life? Don’t be
so severe, O moralist!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No; all the same, what’s fine in life is..." Levin hesitated—"oh,
I don’t know. All I know is that we shall soon be dead."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why so soon?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And do you know, there’s less charm in life, when one thinks of
death, but there’s more peace."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"On the contrary, the finish is always the best. But I must be
going," said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, no, stay a bit!" said Levin, keeping him. "Now, when shall
we see each other again? I’m going tomorrow."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I’m a nice person! Why, that’s just what I came for! You simply
must come to dinner with us today. Your brother’s coming, and
Karenin, my brother-in-law."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You don’t mean to say he’s here?" said Levin, and he wanted to
inquire about Kitty. He had heard at the beginning of the winter
that she was at Petersburg with her sister, the wife of the
diplomat, and he did not know whether she had come back or not;
but he changed his mind and did not ask. "Whether she’s coming
or not, I don’t care," he said to himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"So you’ll come?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Of course."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"At five o’clock, then, and not evening dress."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new
head of his department. Instinct had not misled Stepan
Arkadyevitch. The terrible new head turned out to be an
extremely amenable person, and Stepan Arkadyevitch lunched with
him and stayed on, so that it was four o’clock before he got to
Alexey Alexandrovitch.</span></p>
