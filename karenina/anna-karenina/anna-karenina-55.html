<h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Chapter 19</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>On the day of the races at Krasnoe Selo, Vronsky had come earlier
than usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the
regiment. He had no need to be strict with himself, as he had
very quickly been brought down to the required light weight; but
still he had to avoid gaining flesh, and so he eschewed
farinaceous and sweet dishes. He sat with his coat unbuttoned
over a white waistcoat, resting both elbows on the table, and
while waiting for the steak he had ordered he looked at a French
novel that lay open on his plate. He was only looking at the
book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out;
he was thinking.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was thinking of Anna&#8217;s promise to see him that day after the
races. But he had not seen her for three days, and as her
husband had just returned from abroad, he did not know whether
she would be able to meet him today or not, and he did not know
how to find out. He had had his last interview with her at his
cousin Betsy&#8217;s summer villa. He visited the Karenins&#8217; summer
villa as rarely as possible. Now he wanted to go there, and he
pondered the question how to do it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Of course I shall say Betsy has sent me to ask whether she&#8217;s
coming to the races. Of course, I&#8217;ll go," he decided, lifting
his head from the book. And as he vividly pictured the happiness
of seeing her, his face lighted up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Send to my house, and tell them to have out the carriage and
three horses as quick as they can," he said to the servant, who
handed him the steak on a hot silver dish, and moving the dish up
he began eating.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>From the billiard room next door came the sound of balls
knocking, of talk and laughter. Two officers appeared at the
entrance-door: one, a young fellow, with a feeble, delicate
face, who had lately joined the regiment from the Corps of Pages;
the other, a plump, elderly officer, with a bracelet on his
wrist, and little eyes, lost in fat.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Vronsky glanced at them, frowned, and looking down at his book as
though he had not noticed them, he proceeded to eat and read at
the same time.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What? Fortifying yourself for your work?" said the plump
officer, sitting down beside him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"As you see," responded Vronsky, knitting his brows, wiping his
mouth, and not looking at the officer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"So you&#8217;re not afraid of getting fat?" said the latter, turning a
chair round for the young officer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What?" said Vronsky angrily, making a wry face of disgust, and
showing his even teeth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You&#8217;re not afraid of getting fat?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Waiter, sherry!" said Vronsky, without replying, and moving the
book to the other side of him, he went on reading.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the
young officer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You choose what we&#8217;re to drink," he said, handing him the card,
and looking at him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Rhine wine, please," said the young officer, stealing a timid
glance at Vronsky, and trying to pull his scarcely visible
mustache. Seeing that Vronsky did not turn round, the young
officer got up.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Let&#8217;s go into the billiard room," he said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The plump officer rose submissively, and they moved towards the
door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At that moment there walked into the room the tall and well-built
Captain Yashvin. Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the
two officers, he went up to Vronsky.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! here he is!" he cried, bringing his big hand down heavily on
his epaulet. Vronsky looked round angrily, but his face lighted
up immediately with his characteristic expression of genial and
manly serenity.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That&#8217;s it, Alexey," said the captain, in his loud baritone.
"You must just eat a mouthful, now, and drink only one tiny
glass."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, I&#8217;m not hungry."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There go the inseparables," Yashvin dropped, glancing
sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant
leaving the room. And he bent his long legs, swathed in tight
riding breeches, and sat down in the chair, too low for him, so
that his knees were cramped up in a sharp angle.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why didn&#8217;t you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday? Numerova
wasn&#8217;t at all bad. Where were you?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I was late at the Tverskoys&#8217;," said Vronsky.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah!" responded Yashvin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Yashvin, a gambler and a rake, a man not merely without moral
principles, but of immoral principles, Yashvin was Vronsky&#8217;s
greatest friend in the regiment. Vronsky liked him both for his
exceptional physical strength, which he showed for the most part
by being able to drink like a fish, and do without sleep without
being in the slightest degree affected by it; and for his great
strength of character, which he showed in his relations with his
comrades and superior officers, commanding both fear and respect,
and also at cards, when he would play for tens of thousands and
however much he might have drunk, always with such skill and
decision that he was reckoned the best player in the English
Club. Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin particularly because
he felt Yashvin liked him, not for his name and his money, but
for himself. And of all men he was the only one with whom
Vronsky would have liked to speak of his love. He felt that
Yashvin, in spite of his apparent contempt for every sort of
feeling, was the only man who could, so he fancied, comprehend
the intense passion which now filled his whole life. Moreover,
he felt certain that Yashvin, as it was, took no delight in
gossip and scandal, and interpreted his feeling rightly, that is
to say, knew and believed that this passion was not a jest, not a
pastime, but something more serious and important.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion, but he was aware
that he knew all about it, and that he put the right
interpretation on it, and he was glad to see that in his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! yes," he said, to the announcement that Vronsky had been at
the Tverskoys&#8217;; and his black eyes shining, he plucked at his
left mustache, and began twisting it into his mouth, a bad habit
he had.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, and what did you do yesterday? Win anything?" asked
Vronsky.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Eight thousand. But three don&#8217;t count; he won&#8217;t pay up."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh, then you can afford to lose over me," said Vronsky,
laughing. (Yashvin had bet heavily on Vronsky in the races.)</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No chance of my losing. Mahotin&#8217;s the only one that&#8217;s risky."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race, the
only thing Vronsky could think of just now.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come along, I&#8217;ve finished," said Vronsky, and getting up he went
to the door. Yashvin got up too, stretching his long legs and
his long back.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It&#8217;s too early for me to dine, but I must have a drink. I&#8217;ll
come along directly. Hi, wine!" he shouted, in his rich voice,
that always rang out so loudly at drill, and set the windows
shaking now.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, all right," he shouted again immediately after. "You&#8217;re
going home, so I&#8217;ll go with you."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And he walked out with Vronsky.</span></p>
