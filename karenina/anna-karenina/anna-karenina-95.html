<p class="pfirst"><span>On Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the
2nd of June. Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where
the sitting was held, greeted the members and the president, as
usual, and sat down in his place, putting his hand on the papers
laid ready before him. Among these papers lay the necessary
evidence and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make.
But he did not really need these documents. He remembered every
point, and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory
what he would say. He knew that when the time came, and when he
saw his enemy facing him, and studiously endeavoring to assume an
expression of indifference, his speech would flow of itself
better than he could prepare it now. He felt that the import of
his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have
weight. Meantime, as he listened to the usual report, he had the
most innocent and inoffensive air. No one, looking at his white
hands, with their swollen veins and long fingers, so softly
stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him, and at
the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side,
would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words
would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm, set
the members shouting and attacking one another, and force the
president to call for order. When the report was over, Alexey
Alexandrovitch announced in his subdued, delicate voice that he
had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the
Commission for the Reorganization of the Native Tribes. All
attention was turned upon him. Alexey Alexandrovitch cleared his
throat, and not looking at his opponent, but selecting, as he
always did while he was delivering his speeches, the first person
sitting opposite him, an inoffensive little old man, who never
had an opinion of any sort in the Commission, began to expound
his views. When he reached the point about the fundamental and
radical law, his opponent jumped up and began to protest.
Stremov, who was also a member of the Commission, and also stung
to the quick, began defending himself, and altogether a stormy
sitting followed; but Alexey Alexandrovitch triumphed, and his
motion was carried, three new commissions were appointed, and the
next day in a certain Petersburg circle nothing else was talked
of but this sitting. Alexey Alexandrovitch&#8217;s success had been
even greater than he had anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Next morning, Tuesday, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on waking up,
recollected with pleasure his triumph of the previous day, and he
could not help smiling, though he tried to appear indifferent,
when the chief secretary of his department, anxious to flatter
him, informed him of the rumors that had reached him concerning
what had happened in the Commission.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Absorbed in business with the chief secretary, Alexey
Alexandrovitch had completely forgotten that it was Tuesday, the
day fixed by him for the return of Anna Arkadyevna, and he was
surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came
in to inform him of her arrival.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Anna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning; the carriage
had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram, and so
Alexey Alexandrovitch might have known of her arrival. But when
she arrived, he did not meet her. She was told that he had not
yet gone out, but was busy with his secretary. She sent word to
her husband that she had come, went to her own room, and occupied
herself in sorting out her things, expecting he would come to
her. But an hour passed; he did not come. She went into the
dining room on the pretext of giving some directions, and spoke
loudly on purpose, expecting him to come out there; but he did
not come, though she heard him go to the door of his study as he
parted from the chief secretary. She knew that he usually went
out quickly to his office, and she wanted to see him before that,
so that their attitude to one another might be defined.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She walked across the drawing room and went resolutely to him.
When she went into his study he was in official uniform,
obviously ready to go out, sitting at a little table on which he
rested his elbows, looking dejectedly before him. She saw him
before he saw her, and she saw that he was thinking of her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On seeing her, he would have risen, but changed his mind, then
his face flushed hotly&#8212;a thing Anna had never seen before, and
he got up quickly and went to meet her, looking not at her eyes,
but above them at her forehead and hair. He went up to her, took
her by the hand, and asked her to sit down.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am very glad you have come," he said, sitting down beside her,
and obviously wishing to say something, he stuttered. Several
times he tried to begin to speak, but stopped. In spite of the
fact that, preparing herself for meeting him, she had schooled
herself to despise and reproach him, she did not know what to say
to him, and she felt sorry for him. And so the silence lasted
for some time. "Is Seryozha quite well?" he said, and not
waiting for an answer, he added: "I shan&#8217;t be dining at home
today, and I have got to go out directly."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I had thought of going to Moscow," she said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, you did quite, quite right to come," he said, and was silent
again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation, she began
herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Alexey Alexandrovitch," she said, looking at him and not
dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair, "I&#8217;m a
guilty woman, I&#8217;m a bad woman, but I am the same as I was, as I
told you then, and I have come to tell you that I can change
nothing."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have asked you no question about that," he said, all at once,
resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face;
"that was as I had supposed." Under the influence of anger he
apparently regained complete possession of all his faculties.
"But as I told you then, and have written to you," he said in a
thin, shrill voice, "I repeat now, that I am not bound to know
this. I ignore it. Not all wives are so kind as you, to be in
such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their
husbands." He laid special emphasis on the word "agreeable." "I
shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it, so long
as my name is not disgraced. And so I simply inform you that
our relations must be just as they have always been, and that
only in the event of your compromising me I shall be obliged to
take steps to secure my honor."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But our relations cannot be the same as always," Anna began in a
timid voice, looking at him with dismay.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she saw once more those composed gestures, heard that
shrill, childish, and sarcastic voice, her aversion for him
extinguished her pity for him, and she felt only afraid, but at
all costs she wanted to make clear her position.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I cannot be your wife while I...." she began.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He laughed a cold and malignant laugh.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, in
your ideas. I have too much respect or contempt, or both ... I
respect your past and despise your present ... that I was far from
the interpretation you put on my words."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Anna sighed and bowed her head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence
you show," he went on, getting hot, "&#8212;announcing your infidelity
to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it,
apparently&#8212;you can see anything reprehensible in performing a
wife&#8217;s duties in relation to your husband."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Alexey Alexandrovitch! What is it you want of me?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so
that neither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to
see him. That&#8217;s not much, I think. And in return you will enjoy
all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her
duties. That&#8217;s all I have to say to you. Now it&#8217;s time for me
to go. I&#8217;m not dining at home." He got up and moved towards the
door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Anna got up too. Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him.</span></p>
