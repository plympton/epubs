<p>&#8220;Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my presence.&#160; An unusual&#8212;to me&#8212;a perfectly new character I suspected was yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.&#160; You entered the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly dressed&#8212;much as you are now.&#160; I made you talk: ere long I found you full of strange contrasts.&#160; Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor&#8217;s face: there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.&#160; Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.&#160; I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more.&#160; Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely.&#160; I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade&#8212;the sweet charm of freshness would leave it.&#160; I did not then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem.&#160; Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you&#8212;but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.&#160; Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure.&#160; I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I resumed my notice of you.&#160; There was something glad in your glance, and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social heart; it was the silent schoolroom&#8212;it was the tedium of your life&#8212;that made you mournful.&#160; I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent.&#160; I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble&#8212;a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might be&#8212;whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant.&#160; I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk any more of those days, sir,&#8221; I interrupted, furtively dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for I knew what I must do&#8212;and do soon&#8212;and all these reminiscences, and these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jane,&#8221; he returned: &#8220;what necessity is there to dwell on the Past, when the Present is so much surer&#8212;the Future so much brighter?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see now how the case stands&#8212;do you not?&#8221; he continued.&#160; &#8220;After a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love&#8212;I have found you.&#160; You are my sympathy&#8212;my better self&#8212;my good angel.&#160; I am bound to you with a strong attachment.&#160; I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.&#160; To tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I had but a hideous demon.&#160; I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.&#160; I feared early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences.&#160; This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now&#8212;opened to you plainly my life of agony&#8212;described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier existence&#8212;shown to you, not my <i>resolution</i> (that word is weak), but my resistless <i>bent</i> to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return.&#160; Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours.&#160; Jane&#8212;give it me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you silent, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.&#160; Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!&#160; Not a human being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and idol.&#160; One drear word comprised my intolerable duty&#8212;&#8220;Depart!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, you understand what I want of you?&#160; Just this promise&#8212;&#8216;I will be yours, Mr. Rochester.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Rochester, I will <i>not</i> be yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane!&#8221; recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror&#8212;for this still voice was the pant of a lion rising&#8212;&#8220;Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world, and to let me go another?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane&#8221; (bending towards and embracing me), &#8220;do you mean it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; softly kissing my forehead and cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane, this is bitter!&#160; This&#8212;this is wicked.&#160; It would not be wicked to love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would to obey you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wild look raised his brows&#8212;crossed his features: he rose; but he forebore yet.&#160; I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I shook, I feared&#8212;but I resolved.</p>
<p>&#8220;One instant, Jane.&#160; Give one glance to my horrible life when you are gone.&#160; All happiness will be torn away with you.&#160; What then is left?&#160; For a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some corpse in yonder churchyard.&#160; What shall I do, Jane?&#160; Where turn for a companion and for some hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.&#160; Believe in heaven.&#160; Hope to meet again there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will not yield?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?&#8221;&#160; His voice rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you snatch love and innocence from me?&#160; You fling me back on lust for a passion&#8212;vice for an occupation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for myself.&#160; We were born to strive and endure&#8212;you as well as I: do so.&#160; You will forget me before I forget you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.&#160; I declared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.&#160; And what a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved by your conduct!&#160; Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.&#160; They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.&#160; &#8220;Oh, comply!&#8221; it said.&#160; &#8220;Think of his misery; think of his danger&#8212;look at his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair&#8212;soothe him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his.&#160; Who in the world cares for <i>you</i>? or who will be injured by what you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still indomitable was the reply&#8212;&#8220;<i>I</i> care for myself.&#160; The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.&#160; I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.&#160; I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad&#8212;as I am now.&#160; Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be.&#160; If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth?&#160; They have a worth&#8212;so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane&#8212;quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs.&#160; Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did.&#160; Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.&#160; His fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment, whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist.&#160; He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the certainty of ultimate safety.&#160; The soul, fortunately, has an interpreter&#8212;often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter&#8212;in the eye.&#160; My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed strength almost exhausted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said he, as he ground his teeth, &#8220;never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable.&#160; A mere reed she feels in my hand!&#8221;&#160; (And he shook me with the force of his hold.)&#160; &#8220;I could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her?&#160; Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage&#8212;with a stern triumph.&#160; Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it&#8212;the savage, beautiful creature!&#160; If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only let the captive loose.&#160; Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay dwelling-place.&#160; And it is you, spirit&#8212;with will and energy, and virtue and purity&#8212;that I want: not alone your brittle frame.&#160; Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence&#8212;you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.&#160; Oh! come, Jane, come!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.&#160; The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot, however, would have succumbed now.&#160; I had dared and baffled his fury; I must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are leaving me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not come?&#160; You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?&#160; My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>What unutterable pathos was in his voice!&#160; How hard it was to reiterate firmly, &#8220;I am going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Rochester!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Withdraw, then,&#8212;I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.&#160; Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a glance on my sufferings&#8212;think of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.&#160; &#8220;Oh, Jane! my hope&#8212;my love&#8212;my life!&#8221; broke in anguish from his lips.&#160; Then came a deep, strong sob.</p>
<p>I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back&#8212;walked back as determinedly as I had retreated.&#160; I knelt down by him; I turned his face from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, my dear master!&#8221; I said.&#160; &#8220;God keep you from harm and wrong&#8212;direct you, solace you&#8212;reward you well for your past kindness to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Jane&#8217;s love would have been my best reward,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;without it, my heart is broken.&#160; But Jane will give me her love: yes&#8212;nobly, generously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell!&#8221; was the cry of my heart as I left him.&#160; Despair added, &#8220;Farewell for ever!&#8221;</p>
<p class="c1">* * * * *</p>
<p>That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as I lay down in bed.&#160; I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.&#160; The light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling.&#160; I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about to sever.&#160; I watched her come&#8212;watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.&#160; She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.&#160; It gazed and gazed on me.&#160; It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter, flee temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.&#160; It was yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.&#160; &#8220;It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,&#8221; thought I.&#160; I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.&#160; I knew where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.&#160; In seeking these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago.&#160; I left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride&#8217;s who had melted in air.&#160; The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!&#8221; I whispered, as I glided past her door.&#160; &#8220;Farewell, my darling Ad&#232;le!&#8221; I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.&#160; No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.&#160; I had to deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.</p>
<p>I would have got past Mr. Rochester&#8217;s chamber without a pause; but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced to stop also.&#160; No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.&#160; There was a heaven&#8212;a temporary heaven&#8212;in this room for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death,&#8221; and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.&#160; I thought of this.</p>
<p>That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience for day.&#160; He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.&#160; He would have me sought for: vainly.&#160; He would feel himself forsaken; his love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.&#160; I thought of this too.&#160; My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided on.</p>
<p>Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it mechanically.&#160; I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.&#160; I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.&#160; All this I did without one sound.&#160; I opened the door, passed out, shut it softly.&#160; Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.&#160; The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.&#160; Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.</p>
<p>A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.&#160; No reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.&#160; Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.&#160; The first was a page so heavenly sweet&#8212;so deadly sad&#8212;that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.&#160; The last was an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.</p>
<p>I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.&#160; I believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew.&#160; But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.&#160; He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering&#8212;and oh! with agony I thought of what I left.&#160; I could not help it.&#160; I thought of him now&#8212;in his room&#8212;watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and be his.&#160; I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.&#160; As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered.&#160; I could go back and be his comforter&#8212;his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.&#160; Oh, that fear of his self-abandonment&#8212;far worse than my abandonment&#8212;how it goaded me!&#160; It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.&#160; Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds were emblems of love.&#160; What was I?&#160; In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.&#160; I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect.&#160; I had injured&#8212;wounded&#8212;left my master.&#160; I was hateful in my own eyes.&#160; Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step.&#160; God must have led me on.&#160; As to my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled the other.&#160; I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast, fast I went like one delirious.&#160; A weakness, beginning inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.&#160; I had some fear&#8212;or hope&#8212;that here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my feet&#8212;as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.</p>
<p>When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.&#160; I stood up and lifted my hand; it stopped.&#160; I asked where it was going: the driver named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections.&#160; I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.&#160; He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.</p>
<p>Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!&#160; May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.&#160; May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00031">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<p>Two days are passed.&#160; It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.&#160; The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.&#160; At this moment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.</p>
<p>Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness.&#160; Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty.&#160; From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.&#160; There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet.&#160; The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south&#8212;white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.&#160; Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost.&#160; I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion.&#160; Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment&#8212;not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are&#8212;none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me.&#160; I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and ask repose.</p>
<p>I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under it.&#160; High banks of moor were about me; the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.</p>
<p>Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me.&#160; If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.&#160; Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.&#160; As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.</p>
<p>What was I to do?&#160; Where to go?&#160; Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do nothing and go nowhere!&#8212;when a long way must yet be measured by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation&#8212;when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!</p>
<p>I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer day.&#160; I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge.&#160; The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered.&#160; Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.&#160; To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price.&#160; I had one morsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny&#8212;my last coin.&#160; I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread.&#160; My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit&#8217;s meal.&#160; I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.</p>
<p class="c1"><a>I said my evening prayers</a></p>
<p>Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for the night-air to invade.&#160; I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.&#160; Thus lodged, I was not, at least&#8212;at the commencement of the night, cold.</p>
<p>My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.&#160; It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.&#160; It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him.</p>
<p>Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.&#160; Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear.&#160; We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence.&#160; I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester.&#160; Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-way.&#160; Remembering what it was&#8212;what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light&#8212;I felt the might and strength of God.&#160; Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.&#160; I turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits.&#160; Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God&#8217;s, and by God would he be guarded.&#160; I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow.</p>
<p>But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.&#160; Long after the little birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried&#8212;when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky&#8212;I got up, and I looked round me.</p>
<p>What a still, hot, perfect day!&#160; What a golden desert this spreading moor!&#160; Everywhere sunshine.&#160; I wished I could live in it and on it.&#160; I saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries.&#160; I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.&#160; But I was a human being, and had a human being&#8217;s wants: I must not linger where there was nothing to supply them.&#160; I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.&#160; Hopeless of the future, I wished but this&#8212;that my Maker had that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.&#160; Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities.&#160; The burden must be carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.&#160; I set out.</p>
<p>Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and high.&#160; By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.&#160; I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered me&#8212;might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb&#8212;I heard a bell chime&#8212;a church bell.</p>
<p>I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire.&#160; All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea.&#160; Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.&#160; Human life and human labour were near.&#160; I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest.</p>
<p>About two o&#8217;clock p.m. I entered the village.&#160; At the bottom of its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.&#160; I coveted a cake of bread.&#160; With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.&#160; The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings.&#160; I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.&#160; Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls?&#160; I considered.&#160; I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.&#160; I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.&#160; I did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try.</p>
<p>I entered the shop: a woman was there.&#160; Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.&#160; How could she serve me?&#160; I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared.&#160; I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.&#160; I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.&#160; Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.&#160; She pointed to a seat; I sank into it.&#160; I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it.&#160; Soon I asked her &#8220;if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the village?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; two or three.&#160; Quite as many as there was employment for.&#8221;</p>
<p>I reflected.&#160; I was driven to the point now.&#160; I was brought face to face with Necessity.&#160; I stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend, without a coin.&#160; I must do something.&#160; What?&#160; I must apply somewhere.&#160; Where?</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay; she couldn&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the chief trade in this place?&#160; What did most of the people do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver&#8217;s needle-factory, and at the foundry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Oliver employ women?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay; it was men&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do the women do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knawn&#8217;t,&#8221; was the answer.&#160; &#8220;Some does one thing, and some another.&#160; Poor folk mun get on as they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to importune her?&#160; A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently wanted.&#160; I took leave.</p>
<p>I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to enter any.&#160; I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.&#160; Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge.&#160; Ere many minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something&#8212;a resource, or at least an informant.&#160; A pretty little house stood at the top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming.&#160; I stopped at it.&#160; What business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering knocker?&#160; In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?&#160; Yet I drew near and knocked.&#160; A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door.&#160; In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame&#8212;a voice wretchedly low and faltering&#8212;I asked if a servant was wanted here?</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said she; &#8220;we do not keep a servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?&#8221; I continued.&#160; &#8220;I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.&#160; I want some work: no matter what.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position, tale.&#160; She shook her head, she &#8220;was sorry she could give me no information,&#8221; and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it shut me out.&#160; If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.</p>
<p>I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no prospect of aid was visible.&#160; I should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature&#8217;s cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance of food.&#160; Solitude would be no solitude&#8212;rest no rest&#8212;while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.</p>
<p>I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask&#8212;no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.&#160; Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog.&#160; In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened towards it.&#160; Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.&#160; I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for introduction and aid.&#160; It is the clergyman&#8217;s function to help&#8212;at least with advice&#8212;those who wished to help themselves.&#160; I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here.&#160; Renewing then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.&#160; I reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.&#160; An old woman opened: I asked was this the parsonage?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the clergyman in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would he be in soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he was gone from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To a distance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so far&#8212;happen three mile.&#160; He had been called away by the sudden death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a fortnight longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there any lady of the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;&#8221; and of her, reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.</p>
<p>Once more I took off my handkerchief&#8212;once more I thought of the cakes of bread in the little shop.&#160; Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine!&#160; Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request&#8212;&#8220;Would she give me a roll for this handkerchief?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at me with evident suspicion: &#8220;Nay, she never sold stuff i&#8217; that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.&#160; &#8220;How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would she take my gloves?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! what could she do with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.&#160; Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.&#160; I blamed none of those who repulsed me.&#160; I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so.&#160; To be sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?&#160; Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my character.&#160; And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.&#160; Let me condense now.&#160; I am sick of the subject.</p>
<p>A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.&#160; I stopped and said&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.&#8221;&#160; He cast on me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from his loaf, and gave it to me.&#160; I imagine he did not think I was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown loaf.&#160; As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.</p>
<p>I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood I have before alluded to.&#160; But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me.&#160; Towards morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet.&#160; Do not ask me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.&#160; At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough.&#160; &#8220;Will you give me that?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p class="c1"><a>&#8220;Will you give me that?&#8221; I asked</a></p>
<p>She stared at me.&#160; &#8220;Mother!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;there is a woman wants me to give her these porridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well lass,&#8221; replied a voice within, &#8220;give it her if she&#8217;s a beggar.&#160; T&#8217; pig doesn&#8217;t want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it ravenously.</p>
<p>As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.</p>
<p>&#8220;My strength is quite failing me,&#8221; I said in a soliloquy.&#160; &#8220;I feel I cannot go much farther.&#160; Shall I be an outcast again this night?&#160; While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?&#160; I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?&#160; But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation&#8212;this total prostration of hope.&#160; In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning.&#160; And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death?&#160; Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?&#160; Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.&#160; Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer!&#160; Aid!&#8212;direct me!&#8221;</p>
<p>My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.&#160; I saw I had strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.&#160; The very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.&#160; I had, by cross-ways and by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road,&#8221; I reflected.&#160; &#8220;And far better that crows and ravens&#8212;if any ravens there be in these regions&#8212;should pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper&#8217;s grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the hill, then, I turned.&#160; I reached it.&#160; It remained now only to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.&#160; But all the surface of the waste looked level.&#160; It showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath.&#160; Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.</p>
<p>My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.&#160; &#8220;That is an <i>ignis fatuus</i>,&#8221; was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.&#160; It burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.&#160; &#8220;Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?&#8221; I questioned.&#160; I watched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not enlarge.&#160; &#8220;It may be a candle in a house,&#8221; I then conjectured; &#8220;but if so, I can never reach it.&#160; It is much too far away: and were it within a yard of me, what would it avail?&#160; I should but knock at the door to have it shut in my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.&#160; I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin.&#160; Could I but have stiffened to the still frost&#8212;the friendly numbness of death&#8212;it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.&#160; I rose ere long.</p>
<p>The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.&#160; I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.&#160; It led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer.&#160; Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties.&#160; This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.</p>
<p>Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.&#160; I approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees&#8212;firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom.&#160; My star vanished as I drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it.&#160; I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall&#8212;above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.&#160; I groped on.&#160; Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate&#8212;a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.&#160; On each side stood a sable bush-holly or yew.</p>
<p>Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere.&#160; All was obscurity.&#160; Were the inmates retired to rest?&#160; I feared it must be so.&#160; In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.&#160; The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within.&#160; I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire.&#160; I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.&#160; The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.</p>
<p>I noticed these objects cursorily only&#8212;in them there was nothing extraordinary.&#160; A group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.&#160; Two young, graceful women&#8212;ladies in every point&#8212;sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girl&#8212;in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.</p>
<p>A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!&#160; Who were they?&#160; They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation.&#160; I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.&#160; I cannot call them handsome&#8212;they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.&#160; A stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation.&#160; This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman&#8217;s knitting-needles.&#160; When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Diana,&#8221; said one of the absorbed students; &#8220;Franz and old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which he has awakened in terror&#8212;listen!&#8221;&#160; And in a low voice she read something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an unknown tongue&#8212;neither French nor Latin.&#160; Whether it were Greek or German I could not tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is strong,&#8221; she said, when she had finished: &#8220;I relish it.&#8221;&#160; The other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated, while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.&#160; At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me&#8212;conveying no meaning:&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.&#8217;&#160; Good! good!&#8221; she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.&#160; &#8220;There you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!&#160; The line is worth a hundred pages of fustian.&#160; &#8216;Ich w&#228;ge die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.&#8217;&#160; I like it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Both were again silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there ony country where they talk i&#8217; that way?&#8221; asked the old woman, looking up from her knitting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Hannah&#8212;a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for sure case, I knawn&#8217;t how they can understand t&#8217; one t&#8217;other: and if either o&#8217; ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all&#8212;for we are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.&#160; We don&#8217;t speak German, and we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what good does it do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We mean to teach it some time&#8212;or at least the elements, as they say; and then we shall get more money than we do now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Varry like: but give ower studying; ye&#8217;ve done enough for to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have: at least I&#8217;m tired.&#160; Mary, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mortally: after all, it&#8217;s tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.&#160; I wonder when St. John will come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold watch she drew from her girdle).&#160; It rains fast, Hannah: will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage: soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, childer!&#8221; said she, &#8220;it fair troubles me to go into yond&#8217; room now: it looks so lonesome wi&#8217; the chair empty and set back in a corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he is in a better place,&#8221; continued Hannah: &#8220;we shouldn&#8217;t wish him here again.&#160; And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say he never mentioned us?&#8221; inquired one of the ladies.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hadn&#8217;t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.&#160; He had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o&#8217; ye to be sent for, he fair laughed at him.&#160; He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next day&#8212;that is, a fortnight sin&#8217;&#8212;and he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a&#8217;most stark when your brother went into t&#8217; chamber and fand him.&#160; Ah, childer! that&#8217;s t&#8217; last o&#8217; t&#8217; old stock&#8212;for ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them &#8216;at&#8217;s gone; for all your mother wor mich i&#8217; your way, and a&#8217;most as book-learned.&#160; She wor the pictur&#8217; o&#8217; ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.&#160; Both were fair complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence.&#160; One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary&#8217;s pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana&#8217;s duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls.&#160; The clock struck ten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll want your supper, I am sure,&#8221; observed Hannah; &#8220;and so will Mr. St. John when he comes in.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she proceeded to prepare the meal.&#160; The ladies rose; they seemed about to withdraw to the parlour.&#160; Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me.&#160; More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast.&#160; And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my wants and woes&#8212;to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!&#160; As I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera.&#160; Hannah opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed me by the light of the candle she held.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I speak to your mistresses?&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better tell me what you have to say to them.&#160; Where do you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your business here at this hour?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a night&#8217;s shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah&#8217;s face.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a piece of bread,&#8221; she said, after a pause; &#8220;but we can&#8217;t take in a vagrant to lodge.&#160; It isn&#8217;t likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do let me speak to your mistresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not I.&#160; What can they do for you?&#160; You should not be roving about now; it looks very ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where shall I go if you drive me away?&#160; What shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll warrant you know where to go and what to do.&#160; Mind you don&#8217;t do wrong, that&#8217;s all.&#160; Here is a penny; now go&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.&#160; Don&#8217;t shut the door:&#8212;oh, don&#8217;t, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must; the rain is driving in&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell the young ladies.&#160; Let me see them&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I will not.&#160; You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn&#8217;t make such a noise.&#160; Move off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must die if I am turned away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you.&#160; I&#8217;m fear&#8217;d you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about folk&#8217;s houses at this time o&#8217; night.&#160; If you&#8217;ve any followers&#8212;housebreakers or such like&#8212;anywhere near, you may tell them we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and guns.&#8221;&#160; Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and bolted it within.</p>
<p>This was the climax.&#160; A pang of exquisite suffering&#8212;a throe of true despair&#8212;rent and heaved my heart.&#160; Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir.&#160; I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned&#8212;I wrung my hands&#8212;I wept in utter anguish.&#160; Oh, this spectre of death!&#160; Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror!&#160; Alas, this isolation&#8212;this banishment from my kind!&#160; Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude was gone&#8212;at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeavoured to regain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can but die,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and I believe in God.&#160; Let me try to wait His will in silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there&#8212;dumb and still.</p>
<p>&#8220;All men must die,&#8221; said a voice quite close at hand; &#8220;but all are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be if you perished here of want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who or what speaks?&#8221; I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.&#160; A form was near&#8212;what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing.&#160; With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it you, Mr. St. John?&#8221; cried Hannah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;yes; open quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!&#160; Come in&#8212;your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad folks about.&#160; There has been a beggar-woman&#8212;I declare she is not gone yet!&#8212;laid down there.&#160; Get up! for shame!&#160; Move off, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Hannah!&#160; I have a word to say to the woman.&#160; You have done your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.&#160; I was near, and listened to both you and her.&#160; I think this is a peculiar case&#8212;I must at least examine into it.&#160; Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house.&#8221;</p>
<p class="c1"><a>Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman</a></p>
<p>With difficulty I obeyed him.&#160; Presently I stood within that clean, bright kitchen&#8212;on the very hearth&#8212;trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.&#160; The two ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;St. John, who is it?&#8221; I heard one ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell: I found her at the door,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;She does look white,&#8221; said Hannah.</p>
<p>&#8220;As white as clay or death,&#8221; was responded.&#160; &#8220;She will fall: let her sit.&#8221;</p>
<p>And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.&#160; I still possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps a little water would restore her.&#160; Hannah, fetch some.&#160; But she is worn to nothing.&#160; How very thin, and how very bloodless!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A mere spectre!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she ill, or only famished?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Famished, I think.&#160; Hannah, is that milk?&#160; Give it me, and a piece of bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and put it to my lips.&#160; Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it, and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.&#160; In her simple words, too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: &#8220;Try to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;try,&#8221; repeated Mary gently; and Mary&#8217;s hand removed my sodden bonnet and lifted my head.&#160; I tasted what they offered me: feebly at first, eagerly soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not too much at first&#8212;restrain her,&#8221; said the brother; &#8220;she has had enough.&#8221;&#160; And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little more, St. John&#8212;look at the avidity in her eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more at present, sister.&#160; Try if she can speak now&#8212;ask her her name.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt I could speak, and I answered&#8212;&#8220;My name is Jane Elliott.&#8221;&#160; Anxious as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an <i>alias</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where do you live?&#160; Where are your friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we send for any one you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What account can you give of yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.&#160; I dared to put off the mendicant&#8212;to resume my natural manner and character.&#160; I began once more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account&#8212;which at present I was far too weak to render&#8212;I said after a brief pause&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I can give you no details to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what, then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;do you expect me to do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I replied.&#160; My strength sufficed for but short answers.&#160; Diana took the word&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;that we have now given you what aid you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked at her.&#160; She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both with power and goodness.&#160; I took sudden courage.&#160; Answering her compassionate gaze with a smile, I said&#8212;&#8220;I will trust you.&#160; If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.&#160; Do with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much discourse&#8212;my breath is short&#8212;I feel a spasm when I speak.&#8221;&#160; All three surveyed me, and all three were silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hannah,&#8221; said Mr. St. John, at last, &#8220;let her sit there at present, and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that milk and bread.&#160; Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over.&#8221;</p>
<p>They withdrew.&#160; Very soon one of the ladies returned&#8212;I could not tell which.&#160; A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the genial fire.&#160; In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.&#160; Ere long, with the servant&#8217;s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.&#160; I thanked God&#8212;experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy&#8212;and slept.</p>
