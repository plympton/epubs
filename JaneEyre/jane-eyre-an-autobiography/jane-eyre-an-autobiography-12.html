<h2 id="dlepubid00032">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind.&#160; I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.&#160; I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed.&#160; To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me.&#160; I took no note of the lapse of time&#8212;of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening.&#160; I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.&#160; Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.&#160; Her coming disturbed me.&#160; I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.&#160; Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.&#160; They would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very well we took her in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had she been left out all night.&#160; I wonder what she has gone through?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange hardships, I imagine&#8212;poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy would be agreeable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to, myself.&#160; I was comforted.</p>
<p>Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue.&#160; He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to herself.&#160; He said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.&#160; There was no disease.&#160; He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when once commenced.&#160; These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment, &#8220;Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far otherwise,&#8221; responded Diana.&#160; &#8220;To speak truth, St. John, my heart rather warms to the poor little soul.&#160; I wish we may be able to benefit her permanently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is hardly likely,&#8221; was the reply.&#160; &#8220;You will find she is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably injudiciously left them.&#160; We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face which make me sceptical of her tractability.&#8221;&#160; He stood considering me some minutes; then added, &#8220;She looks sensible, but not at all handsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is so ill, St. John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ill or well, she would always be plain.&#160; The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise in bed, and turn.&#160; Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour.&#160; I had eaten with relish: the food was good&#8212;void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed.&#160; When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.&#160; I wished to rise; but what could I put on?&#160; Only my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.&#160; I felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad.&#160; I was spared the humiliation.</p>
<p>On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.&#160; My black silk frock hung against the wall.&#160; The traces of the bog were removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent.&#160; My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable.&#160; There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth my hair.&#160; After a weary process, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.&#160; My clothes hung loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking&#8212;no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left&#8212;I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.</p>
<p>It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire.&#160; Hannah was baking.&#160; Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.&#160; Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, you have got up!&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;You are better, then.&#160; You may sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.&#160; She bustled about, examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.&#160; Turning to me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.&#160; I am no beggar; any more than yourself or your young ladies.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a pause she said, &#8220;I dunnut understand that: you&#8217;ve like no house, nor no brass, I guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not make a beggar in your sense of the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you book-learned?&#8221; she inquired presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, very.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve never been to a boarding-school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was at a boarding-school eight years.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened her eyes wide.&#160; &#8220;Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.&#160; What are you going to do with these gooseberries?&#8221; I inquired, as she brought out a basket of the fruit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mak&#8217; &#8217;em into pies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them to me and I&#8217;ll pick them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must do something.&#160; Let me have them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my dress, &#8220;lest,&#8221; as she said, &#8220;I should mucky it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve not been used to sarvant&#8217;s wark, I see by your hands,&#8221; she remarked.&#160; &#8220;Happen ye&#8217;ve been a dressmaker?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you are wrong.&#160; And now, never mind what I have been: don&#8217;t trouble your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay; he doesn&#8217;t live here: he is only staying a while.&#160; When he is at home, he is in his own parish at Morton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That village a few miles off?</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a parson.&#8221;</p>
<p>I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I had asked to see the clergyman.&#160; &#8220;This, then, was his father&#8217;s residence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and gurt (great) grandfather afore him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their father is dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead three weeks sin&#8217; of a stroke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have no mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mistress has been dead this mony a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you lived with the family long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lived here thirty year.&#160; I nursed them all three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.&#160; I will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar.&#8221;</p>
<p>She again regarded me with a surprised stare.&#160; &#8220;I believe,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was quite mista&#8217;en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And though,&#8221; I continued, rather severely, &#8220;you wished to turn me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?&#160; I thought more o&#8217; th&#8217; childer nor of mysel: poor things!&#160; They&#8217;ve like nobody to tak&#8217; care on &#8217;em but me.&#160; I&#8217;m like to look sharpish.&#8221;</p>
<p>I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You munnut think too hardly of me,&#8221; she again remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do think hardly of you,&#8221; I said; &#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you why&#8212;not so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no &#8216;brass&#8217; and no house.&#160; Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more I ought,&#8221; said she: &#8220;Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor wrang&#8212;but I&#8217;ve clear a different notion on you now to what I had.&#160; You look a raight down dacent little crater.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do&#8212;I forgive you now.&#160; Shake hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.</p>
<p>Hannah was evidently fond of talking.&#160; While I picked the fruit, and she made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details about her deceased master and mistress, and &#8220;the childer,&#8221; as she called the young people.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found.&#160; Marsh End had belonged to the Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, &#8220;aboon two hundred year old&#8212;for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to compare wi&#8217; Mr. Oliver&#8217;s grand hall down i&#8217; Morton Vale.&#160; But she could remember Bill Oliver&#8217;s father a journeyman needlemaker; and th&#8217; Rivers wor gentry i&#8217; th&#8217; owd days o&#8217; th&#8217; Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th&#8217; registers i&#8217; Morton Church vestry.&#8221;&#160; Still, she allowed, &#8220;the owd maister was like other folk&#8212;naught mich out o&#8217; t&#8217; common way: stark mad o&#8217; shooting, and farming, and sich like.&#8221;&#160; The mistress was different.&#160; She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the &#8220;bairns&#8221; had taken after her.&#160; There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they could speak; and they had always been &#8220;of a mak&#8217; of their own.&#8221;&#160; Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.&#160; They had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father&#8217;s death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.&#160; They had been in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other&#8212;never fell out nor &#8220;threaped.&#8221;&#160; She did not know where there was such a family for being united.</p>
<p>Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two ladies and their brother were now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour to tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by the kitchen door.&#160; Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have waited for my leave to descend,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;You still look very pale&#8212;and so thin!&#160; Poor child!&#8212;poor girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.&#160; She possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.&#160; Her whole face seemed to me full of charm.&#160; Mary&#8217;s countenance was equally intelligent&#8212;her features equally pretty; but her expression was more reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.&#160; Diana looked and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.&#160; It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active will.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what business have you here?&#8221; she continued.&#160; &#8220;It is not your place.&#160; Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be free, even to license&#8212;but you are a visitor, and must go into the parlour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very well here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, the fire is too hot for you,&#8221; interposed Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; added her sister.&#160; &#8220;Come, you must be obedient.&#8221;&#160; And still holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit there,&#8221; she said, placing me on the sofa, &#8220;while we take our things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our little moorland home&#8212;to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.&#160; I examined first, the parlour, and then its occupant.</p>
<p>The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet comfortable, because clean and neat.&#160; The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.&#160; A few strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china.&#160; There was no superfluous ornament in the room&#8212;not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a lady&#8217;s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: everything&#8212;including the carpet and curtains&#8212;looked at once well worn and well saved.</p>
<p>Mr. St. John&#8212;sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely sealed&#8212;was easy enough to examine.&#160; Had he been a statue instead of a man, he could not have been easier.&#160; He was young&#8212;perhaps from twenty-eight to thirty&#8212;tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin.&#160; It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his.&#160; He might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.&#160; His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.</p>
<p>This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?&#160; Yet he whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature.&#160; Quiescent as he now sat, there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager.&#160; He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one glance, till his sisters returned.&#160; Diana, as she passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top of the oven.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat that now,&#8221; she said: &#8220;you must be hungry.&#160; Hannah says you have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.&#160; Mr. Rivers now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.&#160; There was an unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted from the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very hungry,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, sir.&#8221;&#160; It is my way&#8212;it always was my way, by instinct&#8212;ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of your appetite at first.&#160; Now you may eat, though still not immoderately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,&#8221; was my very clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said coolly: &#8220;when you have indicated to us the residence of your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being absolutely without home and friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.&#160; I speak particularly of the young ladies.&#160; St. John&#8217;s eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.&#160; He seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people&#8217;s thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that you are completely isolated from every connection?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#160; Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess to admittance under any roof in England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A most singular position at your age!&#8221;</p>
<p>Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the table before me.&#160; I wondered what he sought there: his words soon explained the quest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have never been married?&#160; You are a spinster?&#8221;</p>
<p>Diana laughed.&#160; &#8220;Why, she can&#8217;t be above seventeen or eighteen years old, St. John,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am near nineteen: but I am not married.&#160; No.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.&#160; They all saw the embarrassment and the emotion.&#160; Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced out tears as well as colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you last reside?&#8221; he now asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too inquisitive, St. John,&#8221; murmured Mary in a low voice; but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing look.</p>
<p>&#8220;The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my secret,&#8221; I replied concisely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St. John and every other questioner,&#8221; remarked Diana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;And you need help, do you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.&#160; First, then, tell me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you <i>can</i> do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had now swallowed my tea.&#160; I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Rivers,&#8221; I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at me, openly and without diffidence, &#8220;you and your sisters have done me a great service&#8212;the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death.&#160; This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence.&#160; I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind&#8212;my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.&#160; My parents died before I could know them.&#160; I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable institution.&#160; I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher&#8212;Lowood Orphan Asylum, ---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?&#8212;the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.&#160; I obtained a good situation, and was happy.&#160; This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here.&#160; The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible.&#160; No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three.&#160; Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature.&#160; I observed but two points in planning my departure&#8212;speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross.&#160; To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.&#160; I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.&#160; I know all your sisters have done for me since&#8212;for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor&#8212;and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make her talk any more now, St. John,&#8221; said Diana, as I paused; &#8220;she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.&#160; Come to the sofa and sit down now, Miss Elliott.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the <i>alias</i>: I had forgotten my new name.&#160; Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said your name was Jane Elliott?&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it sounds strange to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your real name you will not give?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would lead to it, I avoid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite right, I am sure,&#8221; said Diana.&#160; &#8220;Now do, brother, let her be at peace a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality&#8212;you would wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters&#8217; compassion, and, above all, with my <i>charity</i> (I am quite sensible of the distinction drawn, nor do I resent it&#8212;it is just): you desire to be independent of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do: I have already said so.&#160; Show me how to work, or how to seek work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you <i>shall</i> stay here,&#8221; said Diana, putting her white hand on my head.&#160; &#8220;You <i>shall</i>,&#8221; repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,&#8221; said Mr. St. John, &#8220;as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.&#160; I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.&#160; I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.&#160; And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can do,&#8221; answered Diana for me; &#8220;and you know, St. John, she has no choice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.&#160; &#8220;If such is your spirit, I promise to aid you, in my own time and way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.&#160; I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength would permit.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00033">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.&#160; In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day, and walk out sometimes.&#160; I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when and where they would allow me.&#160; There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time&#8212;the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.</p>
<p>I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me; what they approved, I reverenced.&#160; They loved their sequestered home.&#160; I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs&#8212;all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly&#8212;and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom&#8212;found a charm both potent and permanent.&#160; They clung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling&#8212;to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs:&#8212;they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment.&#160; I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its strength and truth.&#160; I saw the fascination of the locality.&#160; I felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep&#8212;on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow granite crag.&#160; These details were just to me what they were to them&#8212;so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.&#160; The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them&#8212;wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.</p>
<p>Indoors we agreed equally well.&#160; They were both more accomplished and better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of knowledge they had trodden before me.&#160; I devoured the books they lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had perused during the day.&#160; Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.</p>
<p>If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.&#160; Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.&#160; In her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.&#160; I could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana&#8217;s feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.&#160; Diana offered to teach me German.&#160; I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited me no less.&#160; Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection&#8212;of the strongest kind&#8212;was the result.&#160; They discovered I could draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service.&#160; My skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.&#160; Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.&#160; Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.</p>
<p>As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him.&#160; One reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.</p>
<p>No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat, and, followed by his father&#8217;s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission of love or duty&#8212;I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.&#160; Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would expostulate.&#160; He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than cheerful&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Diana and Mary&#8217;s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some minutes of apparently mournful meditation.</p>
<p>But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a brooding nature.&#160; Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist.&#160; Often, of an evening, when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.</p>
<p>I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it was to his sisters.&#160; He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence&#8212;never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.</p>
<p>Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity of gauging his mind.&#160; I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton.&#160; I wish I could describe that sermon: but it is past my power.&#160; I cannot even render faithfully the effect it produced on me.</p>
<p>It began calm&#8212;and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.&#160; This grew to force&#8212;compressed, condensed, controlled.&#160; The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were softened.&#160; Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines&#8212;election, predestination, reprobation&#8212;were frequent; and each reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.&#160; When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to me&#8212;I know not whether equally so to others&#8212;that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment&#8212;where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations.&#160; I was sure St. John Rivers&#8212;pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was&#8212;had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium&#8212;regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Meantime a month was gone.&#160; Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste of their waiting-woman.&#160; Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind.&#160; One morning, being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the window-recess&#8212;which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study&#8212;and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to frame my inquiry&#8212;for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his&#8212;when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.</p>
<p>Looking up as I drew near&#8212;&#8220;You have a question to ask of me?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer myself to undertake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed both useful and happy here&#8212;as my sisters had evidently become attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure&#8212;I deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they will go in three days now?&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his look denoted abstraction from me and my business.&#160; I was obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?&#160; I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept.&#8221;</p>
<p>He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.&#160; I grew impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need be in no hurry to hear,&#8221; he said: &#8220;let me frankly tell you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.&#160; Before I explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame.&#160; I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father&#8217;s debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.&#160; I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependant&#8217;s crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country&#8212;not only for life, but in death.&#160; Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word, &#8216;Rise, follow Me!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance.&#160; He resumed&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity.&#160; <i>You</i> may even think it degrading&#8212;for I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but <i>I</i> consider that no service degrades which can better our race.&#160; I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer&#8217;s task of tillage is appointed him&#8212;the scantier the meed his toil brings&#8212;the higher the honour.&#160; His, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles&#8212;their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I said, as he again paused&#8212;&#8220;proceed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.&#160; The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you will accept the post I offer you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing&#8212;the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do explain,&#8221; I urged, when he halted once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,&#8212;how trivial&#8212;how cramping.&#160; I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my own master.&#160; I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement.&#160; Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress.&#160; I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls.&#160; I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress&#8217;s house.&#160; Her salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish&#8212;Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley.&#160; The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person.&#160; Will you be this mistress?&#8221;</p>
<p>He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in what light the lot would appear to me.&#160; In truth it was humble&#8212;but then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding&#8212;but then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it was not ignoble&#8212;not unworthy&#8212;not mentally degrading, I made my decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you comprehend me?&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;It is a village school: your scholars will be only poor girls&#8212;cottagers&#8217; children&#8212;at the best, farmers&#8217; daughters.&#160; Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to teach.&#160; What will you do with your accomplishments?&#160; What, with the largest portion of your mind&#8212;sentiments&#8212;tastes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Save them till they are wanted.&#160; They will keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what you undertake, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply gratified.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when will you commence the exercise of your function?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well: so be it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and walked through the room.&#160; Standing still, he again looked at me.&#160; He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#160; What is your reason for saying so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not ambitious.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started at the word &#8220;ambitious.&#8221;&#160; He repeated, &#8220;No.&#160; What made you think of ambition?&#160; Who is ambitious?&#160; I know I am: but how did you find it out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was speaking of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you are not ambitious, you are&#8212;&#8221;&#160; He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have misunderstood the word, and been displeased.&#160; I mean, that human affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.&#160; I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus: any more than I can be content,&#8221; he added, with emphasis, &#8220;to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains&#8212;my nature, that God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed&#8212;made useless.&#160; You hear now how I contradict myself.&#160; I, who preached contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers of water in God&#8217;s service&#8212;I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my restlessness.&#160; Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by some means.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left the room.&#160; In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.</p>
<p>Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving their brother and their home.&#160; They both tried to appear as usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed.&#160; Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet known.&#160; It would probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a parting for life.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,&#8221; she said: &#8220;natural affection and feelings more potent still.&#160; St. John looks quiet, Jane; but he hides a fever in his vitals.&#160; You would think him gentle, yet in some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.&#160; It is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!&#8221;&#160; And the tears gushed to her fine eyes.&#160; Mary bent her head low over her work.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that &#8220;misfortunes never come singly,&#8221; and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip between the cup and the lip.&#160; St. John passed the window reading a letter.&#160; He entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our uncle John is dead,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221; repeated Diana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She riveted a searching gaze on her brother&#8217;s face.&#160; &#8220;And what then?&#8221; she demanded, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What then, Die?&#8221; he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.&#160; &#8220;What then?&#160; Why&#8212;nothing.&#160; Read.&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw the letter into her lap.&#160; She glanced over it, and handed it to Mary.&#160; Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.&#160; All three looked at each other, and all three smiled&#8212;a dreary, pensive smile enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amen!&#160; We can yet live,&#8221; said Diana at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,&#8221; remarked Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what <i>might have been</i>,&#8221; said Mr. Rivers, &#8220;and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with what <i>is</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.</p>
<p>For some minutes no one spoke.&#160; Diana then turned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and think us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.&#160; He was my mother&#8217;s brother.&#160; My father and he quarrelled long ago.&#160; It was by his advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that ruined him.&#160; Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never reconciled.&#160; My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds.&#160; He was never married, and had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.&#160; My father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings.&#160; He had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news.&#160; Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.&#160; The next day I left Marsh End for Morton.&#160; The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for distant B-.&#160; In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.</p>

<p>My home, then, when I at last find a home,&#8212;is a cottage; a little room with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf.&#160; Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such things as are necessary.</p>
<p>It is evening.&#160; I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little orphan who serves me as a handmaid.&#160; I am sitting alone on the hearth.&#160; This morning, the village school opened.&#160; I had twenty scholars.&#160; But three of the number can read: none write or cipher.&#160; Several knit, and a few sew a little.&#160; They speak with the broadest accent of the district.&#160; At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other&#8217;s language.&#160; Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a disposition that pleases me.&#160; I must not forget that these coarsely-clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in those of the best-born.&#160; My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I shall find some happiness in discharging that office.&#160; Much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live on from day to day.</p>
<p>Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?&#160; Not to deceive myself, I must reply&#8212;No: I felt desolate to a degree.&#160; I felt&#8212;yes, idiot that I am&#8212;I felt degraded.&#160; I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.&#160; I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I heard and saw round me.&#160; But let me not hate and despise myself too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong&#8212;that is a great step gained; I shall strive to overcome them.&#160; To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite subdued.&#160; In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute gratification for disgust.</p>
<p>Meantime, let me ask myself one question&#8212;Which is better?&#8212;To have surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort&#8212;no struggle;&#8212;but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr. Rochester&#8217;s mistress; delirious with his love half my time&#8212;for he would&#8212;oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.&#160; He <i>did</i> love me&#8212;no one will ever love me so again.&#160; I shall never more know the sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace&#8212;for never to any one else shall I seem to possess these charms.&#160; He was fond and proud of me&#8212;it is what no man besides will ever be.&#8212;But where am I wandering, and what am I saying, and above all, feeling?&#160; Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool&#8217;s paradise at Marseilles&#8212;fevered with delusive bliss one hour&#8212;suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next&#8212;or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?</p>
<p>Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.&#160; God directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!</p>
<p>Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village.&#160; The birds were singing their last strains&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>&#8220;The air was mild, the dew was balm.&#8221;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere long weeping&#8212;and why?&#160; For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury&#8212;consequences of my departure&#8212;which might now, perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither.&#160; At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton&#8212;I say <i>lonely</i>, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.&#160; I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.&#160; A dog&#8212;old Carlo, Mr. Rivers&#8217; pointer, as I saw in a moment&#8212;was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me.&#160; I asked him to come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters left for you.&#160; I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.&#160; He examined my face, I thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you found your first day&#8217;s work harder than you expected?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#160; On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my scholars very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But perhaps your accommodations&#8212;your cottage&#8212;your furniture&#8212;have disappointed your expectations?&#160; They are, in truth, scanty enough; but&#8212;&#8221; I interrupted&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious.&#160; All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.&#160; I am not absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing&#8212;I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a business.&#160; I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot.&#160; I do not repine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you feel solitude an oppression?&#160; The little house there behind you is dark and empty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears of Lot&#8217;s wife.&#160; What you had left before I saw you, of course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career steadily, for some months at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what I mean to do,&#8221; I answered.&#160; St. John continued&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.&#160; God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get&#8212;when our will strains after a path we may not follow&#8212;we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste&#8212;and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.</p>
<p>&#8220;A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to death.&#160; I burnt for the more active life of the world&#8212;for the more exciting toils of a literary career&#8212;for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate&#8217;s surplice.&#160; I considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.&#160; After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds&#8212;my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread their wings, and mount beyond ken.&#160; God had an errand for me; to bear which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;A missionary I resolved to be.&#160; From that moment my state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness&#8212;which time only can heal.&#160; My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder&#8212;a last conflict with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I <i>will</i> overcome&#8212;and I leave Europe for the East.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I looked too.&#160; Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket.&#160; We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Mr. Rivers.&#160; And good evening, old Carlo.&#160; Your dog is quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true.&#160; Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had surprised him&#8212;his arm resting on the gate, his face directed towards the west.&#160; He turned at last, with measured deliberation.&#160; A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.&#160; There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white&#8212;a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty.&#160; Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.&#160; No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses&#8212;all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers.&#160; I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.&#160; Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling, with a grand-dame&#8217;s bounty.</p>
<p>What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?&#160; I naturally asked myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.&#160; He had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,&#8221; he said, as he crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I only came home from S-&#8221; (she mentioned the name of a large town some twenty miles distant) &#8220;this afternoon.&#160; Papa told me you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?&#8221; pointing to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said St. John.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you shall like Morton?&#8221; she asked of me, with a direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I shall.&#160; I have many inducements to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like your house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I furnished it nicely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very nicely, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have indeed.&#160; She is teachable and handy.&#8221;&#160; (This then, I thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in those of nature!&#160; What happy combination of the planets presided over her birth, I wonder?)</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,&#8221; she added.&#160; &#8220;It will be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.&#160; Mr. Rivers, I have been <i>so</i> gay during my stay at S-.&#160; Last night, or rather this morning, I was dancing till two o&#8217;clock.&#160; The ---th regiment are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed to me that Mr. St. John&#8217;s under lip protruded, and his upper lip curled a moment.&#160; His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed, and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave him this information.&#160; He lifted his gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned it on her.&#160; An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze it was.&#160; She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.</p>
<p>As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.&#160; &#8220;Poor Carlo loves me,&#8221; said she.&#160; &#8220;<i>He</i> is not stern and distant to his friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she patted the dog&#8217;s head, bending with native grace before his young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master&#8217;s face.&#160; I saw his solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.&#160; Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman.&#160; His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.&#160; But he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.&#160; He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Papa says you never come to see us now,&#8221; continued Miss Oliver, looking up.&#160; &#8220;You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.&#160; He is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,&#8221; answered St. John.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a seasonable hour!&#160; But I declare it is.&#160; It is just the hour when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business to occupy him.&#160; Now, Mr. Rivers, <i>do</i> come.&#160; Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?&#8221;&#160; She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot!&#8221; she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if shocked at herself.&#160; &#8220;I am so giddy and thoughtless!&#160; <i>Do</i> excuse me.&#160; It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter.&#160; Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely.&#160; I am sure I pity you.&#160; Do come and see papa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort it cost him thus to refuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any longer: the dew begins to fall.&#160; Good evening!&#8221;</p>
<p>She held out her hand.&#160; He just touched it.&#160; &#8220;Good evening!&#8221; he repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo.&#160; She turned, but in a moment returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you well?&#8221; she asked.&#160; Well might she put the question: his face was blanched as her gown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite well,&#8221; he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.&#160; She went one way; he another.&#160; She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned at all.</p>
<p>This spectacle of another&#8217;s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from exclusive meditation on my own.&#160; Diana Rivers had designated her brother &#8220;inexorable as death.&#8221;&#160; She had not exaggerated.</p>
