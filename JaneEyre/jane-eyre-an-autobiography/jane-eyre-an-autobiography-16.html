<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.&#160; Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating.&#160; &#8216;Where are you?&#8217; seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.&#160; Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.&#160; In spirit, I believe we must have met.&#160; You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents&#8212;as certain as I live&#8212;they were yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>Reader, it was on Monday night&#8212;near midnight&#8212;that I too had received the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to it.&#160; I listened to Mr. Rochester&#8217;s narrative, but made no disclosure in return.&#160; The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or discussed.&#160; If I told anything, my tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural.&#160; I kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot now wonder,&#8221; continued my master, &#8220;that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before.&#160; Now, I thank God!&#160; I know it to be otherwise.&#160; Yes, I thank God!&#8221;</p>
<p>He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute devotion.&#160; Only the last words of the worship were audible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy.&#160; I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he stretched his hand out to be led.&#160; I took that dear hand, held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.&#160; We entered the wood, and wended homeward.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00041">CHAPTER XXXVIII&#8212;CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Reader, I married him.&#160; A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.&#160; When we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John cleaning the knives, and I said&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.&#8221;&#160; The housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one&#8217;s ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment.&#160; Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time John&#8217;s knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you, Miss?&#160; Well, for sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>A short time after she pursued&#8212;&#8220;I seed you go out with the master, but I didn&#8217;t know you were gone to church to be wed;&#8221; and she basted away.&#160; John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I telled Mary how it would be,&#8221; he said: &#8220;I knew what Mr. Edward&#8221; (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)&#8212;&#8220;I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and he&#8217;s done right, for aught I know.&#160; I wish you joy, Miss!&#8221; and he politely pulled his forelock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, John.&#160; Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.&#8221;&#160; I put into his hand a five-pound note.&#160; Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen.&#160; In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the words&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll happen do better for him nor ony o&#8217;t&#8217; grand ladies.&#8221;&#160; And again, &#8220;If she ben&#8217;t one o&#8217; th&#8217; handsomest, she&#8217;s noan fa&#226;l and varry good-natured; and i&#8217; his een she&#8217;s fair beautiful, onybody may see that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.&#160; Diana and Mary approved the step unreservedly.&#160; Diana announced that she would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had better not wait till then, Jane,&#8221; said Mr. Rochester, when I read her letter to him; &#8220;if she does, she will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>How St. John received the news, I don&#8217;t know: he never answered the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester&#8217;s name or alluding to my marriage.&#160; His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.&#160; He has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.</p>
<p>You have not quite forgotten little Ad&#232;le, have you, reader?&#160; I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at the school where he had placed her.&#160; Her frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much.&#160; She looked pale and thin: she said she was not happy.&#160; I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with me.&#160; I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another&#8212;my husband needed them all.&#160; So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing her home sometimes.&#160; I took care she should never want for anything that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.&#160; As she grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.&#160; By her grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.</p>
<p>My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.</p>
<p>I have now been married ten years.&#160; I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth.&#160; I hold myself supremely blest&#8212;blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband&#8217;s life as fully as he is mine.&#160; No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.&#160; I know no weariness of my Edward&#8217;s society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.&#160; To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.&#160; We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking.&#160; All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character&#8212;perfect concord is the result.</p>
<p>Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very near&#8212;that knit us so very close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.&#160; Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.&#160; He saw nature&#8212;he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam&#8212;of the landscape before us; of the weather round us&#8212;and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye.&#160; Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to be done.&#160; And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad&#8212;because he claimed these services without painful shame or damping humiliation.&#160; He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.</p>
<p>One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his dictation, he came and bent over me, and said&#8212;&#8220;Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a gold watch-chain: I answered &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have you a pale blue dress on?&#8221;</p>
<p class="c1"><a>And have you a pale blue dress on?</a></p>
<p>I had.&#160; He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was sure of it.</p>
<p>He and I went up to London.&#160; He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.&#160; He cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him&#8212;the earth no longer a void.&#160; When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once were&#8212;large, brilliant, and black.&#160; On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.</p>
<p>My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love are happy likewise.&#160; Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.&#160; Diana&#8217;s husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man.&#160; Mary&#8217;s is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother&#8217;s, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.&#160; Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.</p>
<p>As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.&#160; He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.&#160; A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.&#160; Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.&#160; He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon.&#160; His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says&#8212;&#8220;Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.&#8221;&#160; His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth&#8212;who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.</p>
<p>St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.&#160; Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting.&#160; The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.&#160; I know that a stranger&#8217;s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord.&#160; And why weep for this?&#160; No fear of death will darken St. John&#8217;s last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast.&#160; His own words are a pledge of this&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Master,&#8221; he says, &#8220;has forewarned me.&#160; Daily He announces more distinctly,&#8212;&#8216;Surely I come quickly!&#8217; and hourly I more eagerly respond,&#8212;&#8216;Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
