<p>I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.&#160; I hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for it was now getting dark.&#160; There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.&#160; I looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.&#160; I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.</p>
<p>Well did I remember Mrs. Reed&#8217;s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image.&#160; It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.&#160; I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries&#8212;to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.</p>
<p>The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever&#8212;there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow.&#160; How often had it lowered on me menace and hate! and how the recollection of childhood&#8217;s terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh line now!&#160; And yet I stooped down and kissed her: she looked at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Jane Eyre?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Reed.&#160; How are you, dear aunt?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now.&#160; My fingers had fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure.&#160; But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated.&#160; Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm.&#160; Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me&#8212;her feeling towards me&#8212;was unchanged and unchangeable.&#160; I knew by her stony eye&#8212;opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears&#8212;that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.</p>
<p>I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to subdue her&#8212;to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.&#160; My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source.&#160; I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sent for me,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and I am here; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course!&#160; You have seen my daughters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a difficulty in recalling them.&#160; But there was something I wished to say&#8212;let me see&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame.&#160; Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she was at once irritated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit up!&#8221; said she; &#8220;don&#8217;t annoy me with holding the clothes fast.&#160; Are you Jane Eyre?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Jane Eyre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.&#160; Such a burden to be left on my hands&#8212;and so much annoyance as she caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one&#8217;s movements!&#160; I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a fiend&#8212;no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her away from the house.&#160; What did they do with her at Lowood?&#160; The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died.&#160; She, however, did not die: but I said she did&#8212;I wish she had died!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband&#8217;s only sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family&#8217;s disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he wept like a simpleton.&#160; He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.&#160; I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it&#8212;a sickly, whining, pining thing!&#160; It would wail in its cradle all night long&#8212;not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.&#160; Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age.&#160; He would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike.&#160; In his last illness, he had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.&#160; I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak.&#160; John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my brothers&#8212;he is quite a Gibson.&#160; Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?&#160; I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor.&#160; I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.&#160; I can never submit to do that&#8212;yet how are we to get on?&#160; Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages.&#160; John gambles dreadfully, and always loses&#8212;poor boy!&#160; He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded&#8212;his look is frightful&#8212;I feel ashamed for him when I see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was getting much excited.&#160; &#8220;I think I had better leave her now,&#8221; said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night&#8212;in the morning she is calmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rose.&#160; &#8220;Stop!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Reed, &#8220;there is another thing I wished to say.&#160; He threatens me&#8212;he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.&#160; I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles.&#160; What is to be done?&#160; How is the money to be had?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she succeeded with difficulty.&#160; Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and sank into a dozing state.&#160; I then left her.</p>
<p>More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.&#160; She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite her.&#160; Meantime, I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.&#160; They were very cold, indeed, at first.&#160; Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.&#160; Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of me.&#160; But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me for both.</p>
<p>Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad&#8217;s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow&#8217;s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.</p>
<p>One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know.&#160; I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked away.&#160; Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.&#160; Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead.&#160; Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful working.&#160; I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large.&#160; &#8220;Good! but not quite the thing,&#8221; I thought, as I surveyed the effect: &#8220;they want more force and spirit;&#8221; and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly&#8212;a happy touch or two secured success.&#160; There, I had a friend&#8217;s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me?&#160; I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a portrait of some one you know?&#8221; asked Eliza, who had approached me unnoticed.&#160; I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and hurried it beneath the other sheets.&#160; Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.&#160; But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?&#160; Georgiana also advanced to look.&#160; The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that &#8220;an ugly man.&#8221; They both seemed surprised at my skill.&#160; I offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.&#160; Then Georgiana produced her album.&#160; I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at once into good humour.&#160; She proposed a walk in the grounds.&#160; Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago&#8212;of the admiration she had there excited&#8212;the attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she had made.&#160; In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.&#160; The communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same theme&#8212;herself, her loves, and woes.&#160; It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother&#8217;s illness, or her brother&#8217;s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects.&#160; Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come.&#160; She passed about five minutes each day in her mother&#8217;s sick-room, and no more.</p>
<p>Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.&#160; I never saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.&#160; She had an alarm to call her up early.&#160; I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task.&#160; Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book.&#160; I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and she said, &#8220;the Rubric.&#8221;&#160; Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet.&#160; In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead.&#160; Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her accounts.&#160; She seemed to want no company; no conversation.&#160; I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.</p>
<p>She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual, that John&#8217;s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said, settled her mind, and formed her resolution.&#160; Her own fortune she had taken care to secure; and when her mother died&#8212;and it was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or linger long&#8212;she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world.&#160; I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not.&#160; Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had had.&#160; She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#160; Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town.&#160; &#8220;It would be so much better,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if she could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.&#8221;&#160; I did not ask what she meant by &#8220;all being over,&#8221; but I suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites.&#160; Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister&#8217;s indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had been before her.&#160; One day, however, as she put away her account-book and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth.&#160; You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life.&#160; Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person&#8217;s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.&#160; Then, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be flattered&#8212;you must have music, dancing, and society&#8212;or you languish, you die away.&#160; Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?&#160; Take one day; share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes&#8212;include all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity.&#160; The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one&#8217;s company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do.&#160; Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.&#160; Neglect it&#8212;go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling&#8212;and suffer the results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.&#160; I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it.&#160; After my mother&#8217;s death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other.&#160; You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this&#8212;if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,&#8221; answered Georgiana.&#160; &#8220;Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless creature in existence: and <i>I</i> know your spiteful hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.&#8221;&#160; Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.</p>
<p>True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless for the want of it.&#160; Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.</p>
<p>It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint&#8217;s-day service at the new church&#8212;for in matters of religion she was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.</p>
<p>I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever she could.&#160; Bessie was faithful; but she had her own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.&#160; I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.&#160; I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.</p>
<p>The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: &#8220;One lies there,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements.&#160; Whither will that spirit&#8212;now struggling to quit its material tenement&#8212;flit when at length released?&#8221;</p>
<p>In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her dying words&#8212;her faith&#8212;her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls.&#160; I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered tones&#8212;still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father&#8217;s bosom&#8212;when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: &#8220;Who is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?&#160; I went up to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I, Aunt Reed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8212;I?&#8221; was her answer.&#160; &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.&#160; &#8220;You are quite a stranger to me&#8212;where is Bessie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is at the lodge, aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt,&#8221; she repeated.&#160; &#8220;Who calls me aunt?&#160; You are not one of the Gibsons; and yet I know you&#8212;that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me: you are like&#8212;why, you are like Jane Eyre!&#8221;</p>
<p>I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.&#160; I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight years she must be so changed.&#8221;&#160; I now gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very ill, I know,&#8221; she said ere long.&#160; &#8220;I was trying to turn myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.&#160; It is as well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.&#160; Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I assured her we were alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.&#160; One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the other&#8212;&#8221; she stopped.&#160; &#8220;After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps,&#8221; she murmured to herself: &#8220;and then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed; she seemed to experience some inward sensation&#8212;the precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must get it over.&#160; Eternity is before me: I had better tell her.&#8212;Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I obeyed her directions.&#160; &#8220;Read the letter,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It was short, and thus conceived:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8212;Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?&#160; It is my intention to write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.&#160; Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.&#8212;I am, Madam, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">John Eyre</span>, Madeira.&#8221;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It was dated three years back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did I never hear of this?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity.&#160; I could not forget your conduct to me, Jane&#8212;the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty.&#160; I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a man&#8217;s voice.&#8212;Bring me some water!&#160; Oh, make haste!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mrs. Reed,&#8221; said I, as I offered her the draught she required, &#8220;think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.&#160; Forgive me for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and drawn breath, she went on thus&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not endure.&#160; I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at Lowood.&#160; Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion&#8212;expose my falsehood as soon as you like.&#160; You were born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a very bad disposition,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and one to this day I feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not vindictive.&#160; Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.&#160; She said I oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.&#160; As I laid her down&#8212;for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank&#8212;I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch&#8212;the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,&#8221; I said at last, &#8220;you have my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God&#8217;s, and be at peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me&#8212;dying, she must hate me still.</p>
<p>The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.&#160; I yet lingered half-an-hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.&#160; She was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve o&#8217;clock that night she died.&#160; I was not present to close her eyes, nor were either of her daughters.&#160; They came to tell us the next morning that all was over.&#160; She was by that time laid out.&#160; Eliza and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared not go.&#160; There was stretched Sarah Reed&#8217;s once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.&#160; A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me.&#160; I gazed on it with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for <i>her</i> woes&#8212;not <i>my</i> loss&#8212;and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form.</p>
<p>Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.&#160; After a silence of some minutes she observed&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was shortened by trouble.&#8221;&#160; And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.&#160; Neither of us had dropt a tear.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00025">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>Mr. Rochester had given me but one week&#8217;s leave of absence: yet a month elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.&#160; I wished to leave immediately after the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister&#8217;s interment and settle the family affairs.&#160; Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses.&#160; It is true, that while I worked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, &#8220;If you and I were destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.&#160; I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.&#160; It is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza&#8217;s turn to request me to stay another week.&#160; Her plans required all her time and attention, she said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any one.&#160; She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.</p>
<p>One morning she told me I was at liberty.&#160; &#8220;And,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I am obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!&#160; There is some difference between living with such an one as you and with Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.&#160; To-morrow,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;I set out for the Continent.&#160; I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle&#8212;a nunnery you would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested.&#160; I shall devote myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.&#8221;</p>
<p>I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her from it.&#160; &#8220;The vocation will fit you to a hair,&#8221; I thought: &#8220;much good may it do you!&#8221;</p>
<p>When we parted, she said: &#8220;Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well: you have some sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>I then returned: &#8220;You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent.&#160; However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don&#8217;t much care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in the right,&#8221; said she; and with these words we each went our separate way.&#160; As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her fortune.</p>
<p>How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.&#160; I had known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good fire, and to be unable to get either.&#160; Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.&#160; The return to Thornfield was yet to be tried.</p>
<p>My journey seemed tedious&#8212;very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.&#160; During the first twelve hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.&#160; I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and servants&#8212;few was the number of relatives&#8212;the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service.&#160; Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person and character.&#160; The evening arrival at the great town of&#8212;scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller&#8217;s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.</p>
<p>I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?&#160; Not long; of that I was sure.&#160; I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a fortnight.&#160; Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.&#160; &#8220;You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,&#8221; was my mental comment.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question followed, &#8220;Where was I to go?&#8221;&#160; I dreamt of Miss Ingram all the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester looked on with his arms folded&#8212;smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at both her and me.</p>
<p>I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.&#160; I proposed to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my box in the ostler&#8217;s care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six o&#8217;clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.</p>
<p>It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue&#8212;where blue was visible&#8212;was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.&#160; The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it&#8212;it seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.</p>
<p>I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.&#160; &#8220;Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,&#8221; said I; &#8220;and little Ad&#232;le will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what is so headstrong as youth?&#160; What so blind as inexperience?&#160; These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they added&#8212;&#8220;Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!&#8221;&#160; And then I strangled a new-born agony&#8212;a deformed thing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear&#8212;and ran on.</p>
<p>They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.&#160; I have but a field or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.&#160; How full the hedges are of roses!&#160; But I have no time to gather any; I want to be at the house.&#160; I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see&#8212;Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.</p>
<p>Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment I am beyond my own mastery.&#160; What does it mean?&#160; I did not think I should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of motion in his presence.&#160; I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not make an absolute fool of myself.&#160; I know another way to the house.&#160; It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hillo!&#8221; he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.&#160; &#8220;There you are!&#160; Come on, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face&#8212;which I feel rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved to conceal.&#160; But I have a veil&#8212;it is down: I may make shift yet to behave with decent composure.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is Jane Eyre?&#160; Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?&#160; Yes&#8212;just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a dream or a shade.&#160; What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A true Janian reply!&#160; Good angels be my guard!&#160; She comes from the other world&#8212;from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she meets me alone here in the gloaming!&#160; If I dared, I&#8217;d touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!&#8212;but I&#8217;d as soon offer to take hold of a blue <i>ignis fatuus</i> light in a marsh.&#160; Truant! truant!&#8221; he added, when he had paused an instant.&#160; &#8220;Absent from me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I&#8217;ll be sworn!&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr. Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.&#160; His last words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether I forgot him or not.&#160; And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home&#8212;would that it were my home!</p>
<p>He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.&#160; I inquired soon if he had not been to London.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did she inform you what I went to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir!&#160; Everybody knew your errand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don&#8217;t think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won&#8217;t look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.&#160; I wish, Jane, I were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.&#160; Tell me now, fairy as you are&#8212;can&#8217;t you give me a charm, or a philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be past the power of magic, sir;&#8221; and, in thought, I added, &#8220;A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.&#160; He seemed to think it too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling&#8212;he shed it over me now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass, Janet,&#8221; said he, making room for me to cross the stile: &#8220;go up home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend&#8217;s threshold.&#8221;</p>
<p>All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to colloquise further.&#160; I got over the stile without a word, and meant to leave him calmly.&#160; An impulse held me fast&#8212;a force turned me round.&#160; I said&#8212;or something in me said for me, and in spite of me&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.&#160; I am strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home&#8212;my only home.&#8221;</p>
<p>I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he tried.&#160; Little Ad&#232;le was half wild with delight when she saw me.&#160; Mrs. Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.&#160; Leah smiled, and even Sophie bid me &#8220;bon soir&#8221; with glee.&#160; This was very pleasant; there is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.</p>
<p>I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming grief.&#160; When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Ad&#232;le, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable&#8212;when he said he supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted daughter back again, and added that he saw Ad&#232;le was &#8220;pr&#234;te &#224; croquer sa petite maman Anglaise&#8221;&#8212;I half ventured to hope that he would, even after his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.</p>
<p>A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.&#160; Nothing was said of the master&#8217;s marriage, and I saw no preparation going on for such an event.&#160; Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.&#160; Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.</p>
<p>One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance to an ardent lover?&#160; To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning&#8217;s ride.&#160; I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.&#160; I used to look at my master&#8217;s face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings.&#160; If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.&#160; Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder to me when there&#8212;and, alas! never had I loved him so well.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00026">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-girt land.&#160; It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion.&#160; The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.</p>
<p>On Midsummer-eve, Ad&#232;le, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.&#160; I watched her drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.</p>
<p>It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:&#8212;&#8220;Day its fervid fires had wasted,&#8221; and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.&#160; Where the sun had gone down in simple state&#8212;pure of the pomp of clouds&#8212;spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.&#160; The east had its own charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.</p>
<p>I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent&#8212;that of a cigar&#8212;stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard.&#160; No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it from the lawn.&#160; At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the fence.&#160; Here one could wander unseen.&#160; While such honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed&#8212;not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.</p>
<p>Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of shrub nor flower; it is&#8212;I know it well&#8212;it is Mr. Rochester&#8217;s cigar.&#160; I look round and I listen.&#160; I see trees laden with ripening fruit.&#160; I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.&#160; I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering.&#160; I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.</p>
<p>But no&#8212;eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on their petals.&#160; A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester&#8217;s foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, he has his back towards me,&#8221; thought I, &#8220;and he is occupied too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.&#160; &#8220;I shall get by very well,&#8221; I meditated.&#160; As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without turning&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, come and look at this fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind&#8212;could his shadow feel?&#160; I started at first, and then I approached him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at his wings,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he reminds me rather of a West Indian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England; there! he is flown.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moth roamed away.&#160; I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr. Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful embarrassment.&#160; I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege for leaving him.&#160; I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil&#8212;if evil existent or prospective there was&#8212;seemed to lie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut, &#8220;Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have become in some degree attached to the house,&#8212;you, who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am attached to it, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And though I don&#8217;t comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Ad&#232;le, too; and even for simple dame Fairfax?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And would be sorry to part with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pity!&#8221; he said, and sighed and paused.&#160; &#8220;It is always the way of events in this life,&#8221; he continued presently: &#8220;no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I move on, sir?&#8221; I asked.&#160; &#8220;Must I leave Thornfield?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you must, Jane.&#160; I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you must.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is come now&#8212;I must give it to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you <i>are</i> going to be married, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ex-act-ly&#8212;pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail straight on the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very soon, my&#8212;that is, Miss Eyre: and you&#8217;ll remember, Jane, the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old bachelor&#8217;s neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy estate of matrimony&#8212;to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she&#8217;s an extensive armful: but that&#8217;s not to the point&#8212;one can&#8217;t have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying&#8212;listen to me, Jane!&#160; You&#8217;re not turning your head to look after more moths, are you?&#160; That was only a lady-clock, child, &#8216;flying away home.&#8217;&#160; I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with that discretion I respect in you&#8212;with that foresight, prudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent position&#8212;that in case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Ad&#232;le had better trot forthwith.&#160; I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I&#8217;ll try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I have made it my law of action.&#160; Ad&#232;le must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose&#8212;&#8221; I was going to say, &#8220;I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to betake myself to:&#8221; but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.</p>
<p>&#8220;In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,&#8221; continued Mr. Rochester; &#8220;and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no need to apologise!&#160; I consider that when a dependent does her duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O&#8217;Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.&#160; You&#8217;ll like Ireland, I think: they&#8217;re such warm-hearted people there, they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a long way off, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter&#8212;a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From what, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From England and from Thornfield: and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From <i>you</i>, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free will, my tears gushed out.&#160; I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I avoided sobbing.&#160; The thought of Mrs. O&#8217;Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean&#8212;wealth, caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a long way,&#8221; I again said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that&#8217;s morally certain.&#160; I never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the country.&#160; We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the little time that remains to them close to each other.&#160; Come! we&#8217;ll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.&#160; Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit there together.&#8221;&#160; He seated me and himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can&#8217;t do better, how is it to be helped?&#160; Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you&#8212;especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.&#160; And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I&#8217;ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.&#160; As for you,&#8212;you&#8217;d forget me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I <i>never</i> should, sir: you know&#8212;&#8221;&#160; Impossible to proceed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?&#160; Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot with acute distress.&#160; When I did speak, it was only to express an impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are sorry to leave it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,&#8212;and to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:&#8212;I love it, because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,&#8212;momentarily at least.&#160; I have not been trampled on.&#160; I have not been petrified.&#160; I have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high.&#160; I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,&#8212;with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind.&#160; I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever.&#160; I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you see the necessity?&#8221; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#160; You, sir, have placed it before me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what shape?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,&#8212;your bride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My bride!&#160; What bride?&#160; I have no bride!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes;&#8212;I will!&#8212;I will!&#8221;&#160; He set his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must go:&#8212;you have said it yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No: you must stay!&#160; I swear it&#8212;and the oath shall be kept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I must go!&#8221; I retorted, roused to something like passion.&#160; &#8220;Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?&#160; Do you think I am an automaton?&#8212;a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?&#160; Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?&#160; You think wrong!&#8212;I have as much soul as you,&#8212;and full as much heart!&#160; And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.&#160; I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;&#8212;it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God&#8217;s feet, equal,&#8212;as we are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As we are!&#8221; repeated Mr. Rochester&#8212;&#8220;so,&#8221; he added, enclosing me in his arms.&#160; Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: &#8220;so, Jane!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so, sir,&#8221; I rejoined: &#8220;and yet not so; for you are a married man&#8212;or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you&#8212;to one with whom you have no sympathy&#8212;whom I do not believe you truly love; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her.&#160; I would scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you&#8212;let me go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where, Jane?&#160; To Ireland?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;to Ireland.&#160; I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, be still; don&#8217;t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your will shall decide your destiny,&#8221; he said: &#8220;I offer you my hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask you to pass through life at my side&#8212;to be my second self, and best earthly companion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too.&#8221;</p>
<p>A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away&#8212;away&#8212;to an indefinite distance&#8212;it died.&#160; The nightingale&#8217;s song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept.&#160; Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking at me gently and seriously.&#160; Some time passed before he spoke; he at last said&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was silent: I thought he mocked me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Jane&#8212;come hither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your bride stands between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose, and with a stride reached me.</p>
<p>&#8220;My bride is here,&#8221; he said, again drawing me to him, &#8220;because my equal is here, and my likeness.&#160; Jane, will you marry me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I was still incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you doubt me, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no faith in me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a whit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I a liar in your eyes?&#8221; he asked passionately.&#160; &#8220;Little sceptic, you <i>shall</i> be convinced.&#160; What love have I for Miss Ingram?&#160; None: and that you know.&#160; What love has she for me?&#160; None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother.&#160; I would not&#8212;I could not&#8212;marry Miss Ingram.&#160; You&#8212;you strange, you almost unearthly thing!&#8212;I love as my own flesh.&#160; You&#8212;poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are&#8212;I entreat to accept me as a husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, me!&#8221; I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness&#8212;and especially in his incivility&#8212;to credit his sincerity: &#8220;me who have not a friend in the world but you&#8212;if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have given me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Jane, I must have you for my own&#8212;entirely my own.&#160; Will you be mine?&#160; Say yes, quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I want to read your countenance&#8212;turn!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched page.&#160; Read on: only make haste, for I suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane, you torture me!&#8221; he exclaimed.&#160; &#8220;With that searching and yet faithful and generous look, you torture me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I do that?&#160; If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion&#8212;they cannot torture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gratitude!&#8221; he ejaculated; and added wildly&#8212;&#8220;Jane accept me quickly.&#160; Say, Edward&#8212;give me my name&#8212;Edward&#8212;I will marry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in earnest?&#160; Do you truly love me?&#160; Do you sincerely wish me to be your wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, sir, I will marry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Edward&#8212;my little wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Edward!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to me&#8212;come to me entirely now,&#8221; said he; and added, in his deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, &#8220;Make my happiness&#8212;I will make yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God pardon me!&#8221; he subjoined ere long; &#8220;and man meddle not with me: I have her, and will hold her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no one to meddle, sir.&#160; I have no kindred to interfere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8212;that is the best of it,&#8221; he said.&#160; And if I had loved him less I should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but, sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting&#8212;called to the paradise of union&#8212;I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so abundant a flow.&#160; Again and again he said, &#8220;Are you happy, Jane?&#8221;&#160; And again and again I answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;&#160; After which he murmured, &#8220;It will atone&#8212;it will atone.&#160; Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?&#160; Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?&#160; Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?&#160; It will expiate at God&#8217;s tribunal.&#160; I know my Maker sanctions what I do.&#160; For the world&#8217;s judgment&#8212;I wash my hands thereof.&#160; For man&#8217;s opinion&#8212;I defy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what had befallen the night?&#160; The moon was not yet set, and we were all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master&#8217;s face, near as I was.&#160; And what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go in,&#8221; said Mr. Rochester: &#8220;the weather changes.&#160; I could have sat with thee till morning, Jane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; thought I, &#8220;could I with you.&#8221;&#160; I should have said so, perhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>The rain rushed down.&#160; He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds, and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the threshold.&#160; He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.&#160; I did not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.&#160; The lamp was lit.&#160; The clock was on the stroke of twelve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasten to take off your wet things,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and before you go, good-night&#8212;good-night, my darling!&#8221;</p>
<p>He kissed me repeatedly.&#160; When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.&#160; I only smiled at her, and ran upstairs.&#160; &#8220;Explanation will do for another time,&#8221; thought I.&#160; Still, when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.&#160; But joy soon effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours&#8217; duration, I experienced no fear and little awe.&#160; Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was strength for anything.</p>
<p>Before I left my bed in the morning, little Ad&#232;le came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.</p>
