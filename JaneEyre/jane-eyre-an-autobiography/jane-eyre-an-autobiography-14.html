<p>I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.&#160; They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.&#160; I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.</p>
<p>Sweet was that evening.&#160; My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John&#8217;s taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.&#160; The event of the day&#8212;that is, the return of Diana and Mary&#8212;pleased him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.&#160; In the very meridian of the night&#8217;s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the door.&#160; Hannah entered with the intimation that &#8220;a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his mother, who was drawing away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does she live, Hannah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure, sir, you had better not.&#160; It&#8217;s the worst road to travel after dark that can be: there&#8217;s no track at all over the bog.&#160; And then it is such a bitter night&#8212;the keenest wind you ever felt.&#160; You had better send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, he departed.&#160; It was then nine o&#8217;clock: he did not return till midnight.&#160; Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier than when he set out.&#160; He had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms with himself.</p>
<p>I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.&#160; It was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissipation.&#160; The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary&#8217;s spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night.&#160; They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.&#160; St. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.</p>
<p>One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some minutes, asked him, &#8220;If his plans were yet unchanged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unchanged and unchangeable,&#8221; was the reply.&#160; And he proceeded to inform us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Rosamond Oliver?&#8221; suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a gesture as if wishing to recall them.&#160; St. John had a book in his hand&#8212;it was his unsocial custom to read at meals&#8212;he closed it, and looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosamond Oliver,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him: he was serene as glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;The match must have been got up hastily,&#8221; said Diana: &#8220;they cannot have known each other long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.&#160; But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them, can he refitted for their reception.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded.&#160; Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.&#160; He had not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the village schoolmistress.&#160; When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity.</p>
<p>Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a moment&#8217;s hesitation I answered&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose triumphs have cost them too dear?&#160; Would not such another ruin you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called upon to contend for such another.&#160; The event of the conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!&#8221;&#160; So saying, he returned to his papers and his silence.</p>
<p>As our mutual happiness (<i>i.e.</i>, Diana&#8217;s, Mary&#8217;s, and mine) settled into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes for hours together.&#160; While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of encyclop&#230;dic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his plans.</p>
<p>Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly to our table.&#160; I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,&#8221; he would say: &#8220;she can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of us.&#160; Her constitution is both sound and elastic;&#8212;better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse was a special annoyance.</p>
<p>One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a cold.&#160; His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.&#160; As I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.&#160; How long it had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment superstitious&#8212;as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, what are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Learning German.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not in earnest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.&#8221;</p>
<p>He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three.&#160; Would I do him this favour?&#160; I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now barely three months to his departure.</p>
<p>St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent.&#160; I consented.&#160; When Diana and Mary returned, the former found her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to such a step.&#160; He answered quietly&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.&#160; By degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.&#160; I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him.&#160; I was so fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.&#160; When he said &#8220;go,&#8221; I went; &#8220;come,&#8221; I came; &#8220;do this,&#8221; I did it.&#160; But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.</p>
<p>One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was equally his custom, he gave me his hand.&#160; Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (<i>she</i> was not painfully controlled by his will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don&#8217;t treat her as such: you should kiss her too.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pushed me towards him.&#160; I thought Diana very provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St. John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly&#8212;he kissed me.&#160; There are no such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical cousin&#8217;s salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.&#160; When given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters.&#160; He never omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.</p>
<p>As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.&#160; He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted.&#160; The thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his own.</p>
<p>Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.&#160; Of late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my heart and drained my happiness at its source&#8212;the evil of suspense.</p>
<p>Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these changes of place and fortune.&#160; Not for a moment.&#160; His idea was still with me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.&#160; The craving to know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.</p>
<p>In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester&#8217;s present residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was quite ignorant of all concerning him.&#160; I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the subject.&#160; I had calculated with certainty on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early answer.&#160; I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.</p>
<p>I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.&#160; Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me.&#160; When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and then I felt dark indeed.</p>
<p>A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.&#160; Summer approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the sea-side.&#160; This St. John opposed; he said I did not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool, never thought of resisting him&#8212;I could not resist him.</p>
<p>One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.&#160; Hannah had told me in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.&#160; The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.</p>
<p>St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice failed me: words were lost in sobs.&#160; He and I were the only occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was gardening&#8212;it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.&#160; My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me as to its cause; he only said&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.&#8221;&#160; And while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient, leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient&#8217;s malady.&#160; Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in completing it.&#160; St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and said&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will call Diana and Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.&#160; Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission and determined revolt.&#160; I have always faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John&#8217;s directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side with him.</p>
<p>The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament.&#160; As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us rest here,&#8221; said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem&#8212;where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning&#8212;where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.</p>
<p>I took a seat: St. John stood near me.&#160; He looked up the pass and down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.&#160; He seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I shall see it again,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour&#8212;when another slumber overcomes me&#8212;on the shore of a darker stream!&#8221;</p>
<p>Strange words of a strange love!&#160; An austere patriot&#8217;s passion for his fatherland!&#160; He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the 20th of June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there is my glory and joy.&#160; I am the servant of an infallible Master.&#160; I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.&#160; It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,&#8212;to join in the same enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to march with the strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up&#8212;to urge and exhort them to the effort&#8212;to show them what their gifts are, and why they were given&#8212;to speak Heaven&#8217;s message in their ear,&#8212;to offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what does <i>your</i> heart say?&#8221; demanded St. John.</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart is mute,&#8212;my heart is mute,&#8221; I answered, struck and thrilled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must speak for it,&#8221; continued the deep, relentless voice.&#160; &#8220;Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!&#160; It was as if I had heard a summons from Heaven&#8212;as if a visionary messenger, like him of Macedonia, had enounced, &#8220;Come over and help us!&#8221;&#160; But I was no apostle,&#8212;I could not behold the herald,&#8212;I could not receive his call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, St. John!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;have some mercy!&#8221;</p>
<p>I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty, knew neither mercy nor remorse.&#160; He continued&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;God and nature intended you for a missionary&#8217;s wife.&#160; It is not personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love.&#160; A missionary&#8217;s wife you must&#8212;shall be.&#160; You shall be mine: I claim you&#8212;not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign&#8217;s service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by them.&#160; Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last him to its close&#8212;resolved, however, that that close should be conquest for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humility, Jane,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say right that you are not fit for the work.&#160; Who is fit for it?&#160; Or who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?&#160; I, for instance, am but dust and ashes.&#160; With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me.&#160; I know my Leader: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end.&#160; Think like me, Jane&#8212;trust like me.&#160; It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary labours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to moment.&#160; This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But my powers&#8212;where are they for this undertaking?&#160; I do not feel them.&#160; Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.&#160; I am sensible of no light kindling&#8212;no life quickening&#8212;no voice counselling or cheering.&#160; Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths&#8212;the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an answer for you&#8212;hear it.&#160; I have watched you ever since we first met: I have made you my study for ten months.&#160; I have proved you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?&#160; In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.&#160; In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:&#8212;lucre had no undue power over you.&#160; In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice.&#160; In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it&#8212;in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties&#8212;I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek.&#160; Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself&#8212;I can trust you unreservedly.&#160; As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will be to me invaluable.&#8221;</p>
<p>My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step.&#160; Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.&#160; My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping hand.&#160; He waited for an answer.&#160; I demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very willingly,&#8221; he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.</p>
<p class="c1"><a>He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>can</i> do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge that,&#8221; I meditated,&#8212;&#8220;that is, if life be spared me.&#160; But I feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.&#160; What then?&#160; He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.&#160; The case is very plain before me.&#160; In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land&#8212;Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me?&#160; My business is to live without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.&#160; Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign?&#160; Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes?&#160; I believe I must say, Yes&#8212;and yet I shudder.&#160; Alas!&#160; If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to premature death.&#160; And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?&#160; Oh, I know well!&#160; That, too, is very clear to my vision.&#160; By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I <i>shall</i> satisfy him&#8212;to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.&#160; If I <i>do</i> go with him&#8212;if I <i>do</i> make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar&#8212;heart, vitals, the entire victim.&#160; He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.&#160; Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item&#8212;one dreadful item.&#160; It is&#8212;that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a husband&#8217;s heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge.&#160; He prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all.&#160; Unmarried to him, this would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations&#8212;coolly put into practice his plans&#8212;go through the wedding ceremony?&#160; Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?&#160; Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle?&#160; No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.&#160; I will never undergo it.&#160; As his sister, I might accompany him&#8212;not as his wife: I will tell him so.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column; his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.&#160; He started to his feet and approached me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your answer requires a commentary,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it is not clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have hitherto been my adopted brother&#8212;I, your adopted sister: let us continue as such: you and I had better not marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&#160; &#8220;Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.&#160; If you were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no wife.&#160; But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to any other plan.&#160; Do you not see it, Jane?&#160; Consider a moment&#8212;your strong sense will guide you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.&#160; I said so.&#160; &#8220;St. John,&#8221; I returned, &#8220;I regard you as a brother&#8212;you, me as a sister: so let us continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot&#8212;we cannot,&#8221; he answered, with short, sharp determination: &#8220;it would not do.&#160; You have said you will go with me to India: remember&#8212;you have said that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conditionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8212;well.&#160; To the main point&#8212;the departure with me from England, the co-operation with me in my future labours&#8212;you do not object.&#160; You have already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw it.&#160; You have but one end to keep in view&#8212;how the work you have undertaken can best be done.&#160; Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect&#8212;with power&#8212;the mission of your great Master.&#160; To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother&#8212;that is a loose tie&#8212;but a husband.&#160; I, too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me.&#160; I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow&#8212;his hold on my limbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One fitted to my purpose, you mean&#8212;fitted to my vocation.&#160; Again I tell you it is not the insignificant private individual&#8212;the mere man, with the man&#8217;s selfish senses&#8212;I wish to mate: it is the missionary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I will give the missionary my energies&#8212;it is all he wants&#8212;but not myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.&#160; For them he has no use: I retain them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot&#8212;you ought not.&#160; Do you think God will be satisfied with half an oblation?&#160; Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?&#160; It is the cause of God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.&#160; I cannot accept on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#160; I will give my heart to God,&#8221; I said.&#160; &#8220;<i>You</i> do not want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the feeling that accompanied it.&#160; I had silently feared St. John till now, because I had not understood him.&#160; He had held me in awe, because he had held me in doubt.&#160; How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference: the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.&#160; I saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them.&#160; I understood that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.&#160; The veil fell from his hardness and despotism.&#160; Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I felt his imperfection and took courage.&#160; I was with an equal&#8212;one with whom I might argue&#8212;one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.</p>
<p>He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently risked an upward glance at his countenance.</p>
<p>His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.&#160; &#8220;Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to <i>me</i>!&#8221; it seemed to say.&#160; &#8220;What does this signify?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,&#8221; he said ere long; &#8220;one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.&#160; I trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to God: it is all I want.&#160; Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker&#8217;s spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end.&#160; You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices&#8212;all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling&#8212;all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination&#8212;you will hasten to enter into that union at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I?&#8221; I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea <i>his wife</i>.&#160; Oh! it would never do!&#160; As his curate, his comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour; accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.&#160; I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.&#160; I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.&#160; There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as his wife&#8212;at his side always, and always restrained, and always checked&#8212;forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital&#8212;<i>this</i> would be unendurable.</p>
<p>&#8220;St. John!&#8221; I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he answered icily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A part of me you must become,&#8221; he answered steadily; &#8220;otherwise the whole bargain is void.&#160; How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?&#160; How can we be for ever together&#8212;sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes&#8212;and unwed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I said shortly; &#8220;under the circumstances, quite as well as if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.&#160; And for the rest, though you have a man&#8217;s vigorous brain, you have a woman&#8217;s heart and&#8212;it would not do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would do,&#8221; I affirmed with some disdain, &#8220;perfectly well.&#160; I have a woman&#8217;s heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a comrade&#8217;s constancy; a fellow-soldier&#8217;s frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a neophyte&#8217;s respect and submission to his hierophant: nothing more&#8212;don&#8217;t fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what I want,&#8221; he said, speaking to himself; &#8220;it is just what I want.&#160; And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.&#160; Jane, you would not repent marrying me&#8212;be certain of that; we <i>must</i> be married.&#160; I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I scorn your idea of love,&#8221; I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.&#160; &#8220;I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.&#160; Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell: he could command his countenance thoroughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,&#8221; he said: &#8220;I think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have been roused to speak so unguardedly.&#160; You have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance&#8212;a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between us.&#160; If the reality were required, what should we do?&#160; How should we feel?&#160; My dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage&#8212;forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he; &#8220;it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.&#160; To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom I should wish to say farewell.&#160; I shall be absent a fortnight&#8212;take that space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God.&#160; Through my means, He opens to you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.&#160; Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity.&#160; Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!&#8221;</p>
<p>He had done.&#160; Turning from me, he once more</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>&#8220;Looked to river, looked to hill.&#8221;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy to hear them uttered.&#160; As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected submission&#8212;the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.</p>
<p>That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.&#160; I&#8212;who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him&#8212;was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,&#8221; said Diana, &#8220;during your walk on the moor.&#160; But go after him; he is now lingering in the passage expecting you&#8212;he will make it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him&#8212;he stood at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, St. John,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Jane,&#8221; he replied calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then shake hands,&#8221; I added.</p>
<p>What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!&#160; He was deeply displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor tears move him.&#160; No happy reconciliation was to be had with him&#8212;no cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.</p>
<p>And with that answer he left me.&#160; I would much rather he had knocked me down.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00038">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<p>He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.&#160; He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him.&#160; Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.</p>
<p>Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness&#8212;not that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his power to do so.&#160; Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he and I lived he never would forget them.&#160; I saw by his look, when he turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their echo toned every answer he gave me.</p>
<p>He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner.&#160; To me, he was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument&#8212;nothing more.</p>
<p>All this was torture to me&#8212;refined, lingering torture.&#160; It kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me altogether.&#160; I felt how&#8212;if I were his wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.&#160; Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him.&#160; No ruth met my ruth.&#160; <i>He</i> experienced no suffering from estrangement&#8212;no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.&#160; To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he did not by force, but on principle.</p>
<p>The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.&#160; I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.&#160; Let us be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we are friends,&#8221; was the unmoved reply; while he still watched the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.&#160; You know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we not?&#160; That is wrong.&#160; For my part, I wish you no ill and all good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from regarding you as a stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling enough.&#160; Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could.&#160; I deeply venerated my cousin&#8217;s talent and principle.&#160; His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me severely.&#160; I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must we part in this way, St. John?&#160; And when you go to India, will you leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?&#8221;</p>
<p>He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!&#160; What! do you not go to India?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said I could not unless I married you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will not marry me!&#160; You adhere to that resolution?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the ice of their questions?&#160; How much of the fall of the avalanche is in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#160; St. John, I will not marry you.&#160; I adhere to my resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet crash down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more, why this refusal?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Formerly,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;because you did not love me; now, I reply, because you almost hate me.&#160; If I were to marry you, you would kill me.&#160; You are killing me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His lips and cheeks turned white&#8212;quite white.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I should kill you</i>&#8212;<i>I am killing you</i>?&#160; Your words are such as ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.&#160; They betray an unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even until seventy-and-seven times.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had finished the business now.&#160; While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you will indeed hate me,&#8221; I said.&#160; &#8220;It is useless to attempt to conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on the truth.&#160; That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.&#160; I knew the steely ire I had whetted.&#160; I was heart-wrung.</p>
<p>&#8220;You utterly misinterpret my words,&#8221; I said, at once seizing his hand: &#8220;I have no intention to grieve or pain you&#8212;indeed, I have not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most bitterly he smiled&#8212;most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.&#160; &#8220;And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?&#8221; said he, after a considerable pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will, as your assistant,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>A very long silence succeeded.&#160; What struggle there was in him between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.&#160; He spoke at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.&#160; I proved it to you in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever again alluding to the plan.&#160; That you have done so, I regret&#8212;for your sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>I interrupted him.&#160; Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at once.&#160; &#8220;Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.&#160; You pretend to be shocked by what I have said.&#160; You are not really shocked: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.&#160; I say again, I will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion perfectly.&#160; He answered emphatically but calmly&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.&#160; With me, then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor.&#160; Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society&#8217;s aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your promise and deserting the band you engaged to join.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and much too despotic for the occasion.&#160; I replied&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.&#160; I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with strangers.&#160; With you I would have ventured much, because I admire, confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! you are afraid of yourself,&#8221; he said, curling his lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#160; God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.&#160; Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by some means that doubt is removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.&#160; The interest you cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.&#160; Long since you ought to have crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.&#160; You think of Mr. Rochester?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true.&#160; I confessed it by silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must find out what is become of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It remains for me, then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to remember you in my prayers, and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed become a castaway.&#160; I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.&#160; But God sees not as man sees: <i>His</i> will be done&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.&#160; He was soon out of sight.</p>
<p>On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking very thoughtful.&#160; Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are always agitated and pale now.&#160; I am sure there is something the matter.&#160; Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands.&#160; I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly know what.&#160; St. John is a strange being&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused&#8212;I did not speak: soon she resumed&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he never showed to any one else&#8212;to what end?&#160; I wish he loved you&#8212;does he, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; &#8220;No, Die, not one whit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?&#160; Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He does&#8212;he has asked me to be his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diana clapped her hands.&#160; &#8220;That is just what we hoped and thought!&#160; And you will marry him, Jane, won&#8217;t you?&#160; And then he will stay in England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#160; He wishes you to go to India?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madness!&#8221; she exclaimed.&#160; &#8220;You would not live three months there, I am certain.&#160; You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have refused to marry him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have consequently displeased him?&#8221; she suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him as his sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.&#160; Think of the task you undertook&#8212;one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak.&#160; St. John&#8212;you know him&#8212;would urge you to impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you force yourself to perform.&#160; I am astonished you found courage to refuse his hand.&#160; You do not love him then, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as a husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet he is a handsome fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am so plain, you see, Die.&#160; We should never suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plain!&#160; You?&#160; Not at all.&#160; You are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta.&#8221;&#160; And again she earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must indeed,&#8221; I said; &#8220;for when just now I repeated the offer of serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency.&#160; He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should hear himself on the subject.&#160; He has again and again explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.&#160; He has told me I am formed for labour&#8212;not for love: which is true, no doubt.&#160; But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that I am not formed for marriage.&#160; Would it not be strange, Die, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Insupportable&#8212;unnatural&#8212;out of the question!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;though I have only sisterly affection for him now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him, because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and conversation.&#160; In that case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched.&#160; He would not want me to love him; and if I showed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.&#160; I know he would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet St. John is a good man,&#8221; said Diana.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.&#160; It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his progress, he should trample them down.&#160; Here he comes!&#160; I will leave you, Diana.&#8221;&#160; And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.</p>
<p>But I was forced to meet him again at supper.&#160; During that meal he appeared just as composed as usual.&#160; I had thought he would hardly speak to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.&#160; He addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary manner&#8212;one scrupulously polite.&#160; No doubt he had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he had forgiven me once more.</p>
<p>For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first chapter of Revelation.&#160; It was at all times pleasant to listen while from his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at once so sweet and full&#8212;never did his manner become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone&#8212;that manner a more thrilling meaning&#8212;as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision of the new heaven and the new earth&#8212;told how God would come to dwell with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.</p>
<p>The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them, his eye had turned on me.</p>
<p>&#8220;He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.&#160; But,&#8221; was slowly, distinctly read, &#8220;the fearful, the unbelieving, &amp;c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.</p>
<p>A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.&#160; The reader believed his name was already written in the Lamb&#8217;s book of life, and he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</p>
<p>In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered&#8212;all his stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved on a conquest.&#160; He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path.&#160; He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning.&#160; Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.&#160; He felt the greatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it, could not but feel it too.</p>
<p>The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour in the morning.&#160; Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room&#8212;in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Jane.&#160; As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.&#160; If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim&#8212;to do all things to the glory of God.&#160; My Master was long-suffering: so will I be.&#160; I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent&#8212;resolve, while there is yet time.&#160; Remember, we are bid to work while it is day&#8212;warned that &#8216;the night cometh when no man shall work.&#8217;&#160; Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.&#160; God give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.&#160; He had spoken earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep&#8212;or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible.&#160; All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots&#8212;provided only they be sincere&#8212;have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.&#160; I felt veneration for St. John&#8212;veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned.&#160; I was tempted to cease struggling with him&#8212;to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence, and there lose my own.&#160; I was almost as hard beset by him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.&#160; I was a fool both times.&#160; To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.&#160; So I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.</p>
<p>I stood motionless under my hierophant&#8217;s touch.&#160; My refusals were forgotten&#8212;my fears overcome&#8212;my wrestlings paralysed.&#160; The Impossible&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, my marriage with St. John&#8212;was fast becoming the Possible.&#160; All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.&#160; Religion called&#8212;Angels beckoned&#8212;God commanded&#8212;life rolled together like a scroll&#8212;death&#8217;s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.&#160; The dim room was full of visions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you decide now?&#8221; asked the missionary.&#160; The inquiry was put in gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.&#160; Oh, that gentleness! how far more potent is it than force!&#160; I could resist St. John&#8217;s wrath: I grew pliant as a reed under his kindness.&#160; Yet I knew all the time, if I yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my former rebellion.&#160; His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer: it was only elevated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could decide if I were but certain,&#8221; I answered: &#8220;were I but convinced that it is God&#8217;s will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now&#8212;come afterwards what would!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My prayers are heard!&#8221; ejaculated St. John.&#160; He pressed his hand firmer on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, <i>almost</i> as if he loved me (I say <i>almost</i>&#8212;I knew the difference&#8212;for I had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the question, and thought only of duty).&#160; I contended with my inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.&#160; I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.&#160; &#8220;Show me, show me the path!&#8221; I entreated of Heaven.&#160; I was excited more than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader shall judge.</p>
<p>All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself, were now retired to rest.&#160; The one candle was dying out: the room was full of moonlight.&#160; My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.&#160; Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.&#160; The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.&#160; They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you heard?&#160; What do you see?&#8221; asked St. John.&#160; I saw nothing, but I heard a voice somewhere cry&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane!&#160; Jane!&#160; Jane!&#8221;&#8212;nothing more.</p>
<p>&#8220;O God! what is it?&#8221; I gasped.</p>
<p>I might have said, &#8220;Where is it?&#8221; for it did not seem in the room&#8212;nor in the house&#8212;nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air&#8212;nor from under the earth&#8212;nor from overhead.&#160; I had heard it&#8212;where, or whence, for ever impossible to know!&#160; And it was the voice of a human being&#8212;a known, loved, well-remembered voice&#8212;that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am coming!&#8221; I cried.&#160; &#8220;Wait for me!&#160; Oh, I will come!&#8221;&#160; I flew to the door and looked into the passage: it was dark.&#160; I ran out into the garden: it was void.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back&#8212;&#8220;Where are you?&#8221;&#160; I listened.&#160; The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland loneliness and midnight hush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down superstition!&#8221; I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the black yew at the gate.&#160; &#8220;This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work of nature.&#160; She was roused, and did&#8212;no miracle&#8212;but her best.&#8221;</p>
<p>I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.&#160; It was <i>my</i> time to assume ascendency.&#160; <i>My</i> powers were in play and in force.&#160; I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave me: I must and would be alone.&#160; He obeyed at once.&#160; Where there is energy to command well enough, obedience never fails.&#160; I mounted to my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way&#8212;a different way to St. John&#8217;s, but effective in its own fashion.&#160; I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet.&#160; I rose from the thanksgiving&#8212;took a resolve&#8212;and lay down, unscared, enlightened&#8212;eager but for the daylight.</p>
