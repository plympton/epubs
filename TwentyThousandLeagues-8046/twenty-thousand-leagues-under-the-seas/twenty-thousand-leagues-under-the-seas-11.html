<h2 id="id02472">CHAPTER 6</h2>

<h6 id="id02473">The Greek Islands</h6>

<p id="id02474">AT SUNRISE the next morning, February 12, the Nautilus rose
to the surface of the waves.</p>

<p id="id02475">I rushed onto the platform.  The hazy silhouette of Pelusium was
outlined three miles to the south.  A torrent had carried us from
one sea to the other.  But although that tunnel was easy to descend,
going back up must have been impossible.</p>

<p id="id02476">Near seven o'clock Ned and Conseil joined me.  Those two inseparable
companions had slept serenely, utterly unaware of the Nautilus's feat.</p>

<p id="id02477">"Well, Mr. Naturalist," the Canadian asked in a gently mocking tone,
"and how about that Mediterranean?"</p>

<p id="id02478">"We're floating on its surface, Ned my friend."</p>

<p id="id02479">"What!"  Conseil put in.  "Last night . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id02480">"Yes, last night, in a matter of minutes, we cleared
that insuperable isthmus."</p>

<p id="id02481">"I don't believe a word of it," the Canadian replied.</p>

<p id="id02482">"And you're in the wrong, Mr. Land," I went on.  "That flat coastline
curving southward is the coast of Egypt."</p>

<p id="id02483">"Tell it to the marines, sir," answered the stubborn Canadian.</p>

<p id="id02484">"But if master says so," Conseil told him, "then so be it."</p>

<p id="id02485">"What's more, Ned," I said, "Captain Nemo himself did the honors
in his tunnel, and I stood beside him in the pilothouse while
he steered the Nautilus through that narrow passageway."</p>

<p id="id02486">"You hear, Ned?"  Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id02487">"And you, Ned, who have such good eyes," I added, "you can spot
the jetties of Port Said stretching out to sea."</p>

<p id="id02488">The Canadian looked carefully.</p>

<p id="id02489">"Correct," he said.  "You're right, professor, and your captain's
a superman.  We're in the Mediterranean.  Fine.  So now let's have
a chat about our little doings, if you please, but in such a way
that nobody overhears."</p>

<p id="id02490">I could easily see what the Canadian was driving at.  In any event,
I thought it best to let him have his chat, and we all three went
to sit next to the beacon, where we were less exposed to the damp
spray from the billows.</p>

<p id="id02491">"Now, Ned, we're all ears," I said.  "What have you to tell us?"</p>

<p id="id02492">"What I've got to tell you is very simple," the Canadian replied.
"We're in Europe, and before Captain Nemo's whims take us deep into
the polar seas or back to Oceania, I say we should leave this Nautilus."</p>

<p id="id02493">I confess that such discussions with the Canadian always baffled me.
I didn't want to restrict my companions' freedom in any way,
and yet I had no desire to leave Captain Nemo.  Thanks to him
and his submersible, I was finishing my undersea research by
the day, and I was rewriting my book on the great ocean depths
in the midst of its very element.  Would I ever again have such
an opportunity to observe the ocean's wonders?  Absolutely not!
So I couldn't entertain this idea of leaving the Nautilus before
completing our course of inquiry.</p>

<p id="id02494">"Ned my friend," I said, "answer me honestly.  Are you bored
with this ship?  Are you sorry that fate has cast you into
Captain Nemo's hands?"</p>

<p id="id02495">The Canadian paused for a short while before replying.<br/>

Then, crossing his arms:<br/></p>

<p id="id02496">"Honestly," he said, "I'm not sorry about this voyage under the seas.
I'll be glad to have done it, but in order to have done it,
it has to finish.  That's my feeling."</p>

<p id="id02497">"It will finish, Ned."</p>

<p id="id02498">"Where and when?"</p>

<p id="id02499">"Where?  I don't know.  When?  I can't say.  Or, rather, I suppose
it will be over when these seas have nothing more to teach us.
Everything that begins in this world must inevitably come to an end."</p>

<p id="id02500">"I think as master does," Conseil replied, "and it's extremely
possible that after crossing every sea on the globe, Captain Nemo
will bid the three of us a fond farewell."</p>

<p id="id02501">"Bid us a fond farewell?" the Canadian exclaimed.  "You mean beat
us to a fare-thee-well!"</p>

<p id="id02502">"Let's not exaggerate, Mr. Land," I went on.  "We have nothing
to fear from the captain, but neither do I share Conseil's views.
We're privy to the Nautilus's secrets, and I don't expect that
its commander, just to set us free, will meekly stand by while we
spread those secrets all over the world."</p>

<p id="id02503">"But in that case what do you expect?" the Canadian asked.</p>

<p id="id02504">"That we'll encounter advantageous conditions for escaping just
as readily in six months as now."</p>

<p id="id02505">"Great Scott!"  Ned Land put in.  "And where, if you please,
will we be in six months, Mr. Naturalist?"</p>

<p id="id02506">"Perhaps here, perhaps in China.  You know how quickly the
Nautilus moves.  It crosses oceans like swallows cross the air or
express trains continents.  It doesn't fear heavily traveled seas.
Who can say it won't hug the coasts of France, England, or America,
where an escape attempt could be carried out just as effectively as here."</p>

<p id="id02507">"Professor Aronnax," the Canadian replied, "your arguments
are rotten to the core.  You talk way off in the future:
'We'll be here, we'll be there!'  Me, I'm talking about right now:
we are here, and we must take advantage of it!"</p>

<p id="id02508">I was hard pressed by Ned Land's common sense, and I felt myself
losing ground.  I no longer knew what arguments to put forward
on my behalf.</p>

<p id="id02509">"Sir," Ned went on, "let's suppose that by some impossibility,<br/>

Captain Nemo offered your freedom to you this very day.<br/>

Would you accept?"<br/></p>

<p id="id02510">"I don't know," I replied.</p>

<p id="id02511">"And suppose he adds that this offer he's making you today won't
ever be repeated, then would you accept?"</p>

<p id="id02512">I did not reply.</p>

<p id="id02513">"And what thinks our friend Conseil?"  Ned Land asked.</p>

<p id="id02514">"Your friend Conseil," the fine lad replied serenely, "has nothing to say
for himself.  He's a completely disinterested party on this question.
Like his master, like his comrade Ned, he's a bachelor.
Neither wife, parents, nor children are waiting for him back home.
He's in master's employ, he thinks like master, he speaks like master,
and much to his regret, he can't be counted on to form a majority.
Only two persons face each other here:  master on one side,
Ned Land on the other.  That said, your friend Conseil is listening,
and he's ready to keep score."</p>

<p id="id02515">I couldn't help smiling as Conseil wiped himself out of existence.
Deep down, the Canadian must have been overjoyed at not having
to contend with him.</p>

<p id="id02516">"Then, sir," Ned Land said, "since Conseil is no more, we'll have this
discussion between just the two of us.  I've talked, you've listened.
What's your reply?"</p>

<p id="id02517">It was obvious that the matter had to be settled, and evasions
were distasteful to me.</p>

<p id="id02518">"Ned my friend," I said, "here's my reply.  You have right
on your side and my arguments can't stand up to yours.
It will never do to count on Captain Nemo's benevolence.
The most ordinary good sense would forbid him to set us free.
On the other hand, good sense decrees that we take advantage of our
first opportunity to leave the Nautilus."</p>

<p id="id02519">"Fine, Professor Aronnax, that's wisely said."</p>

<p id="id02520">"But one proviso," I said, "just one.  The opportunity must
be the real thing.  Our first attempt to escape must succeed,
because if it misfires, we won't get a second chance, and Captain Nemo
will never forgive us."</p>

<p id="id02521">"That's also well put," the Canadian replied.  "But your proviso applies
to any escape attempt, whether it happens in two years or two days.
So this is still the question:  if a promising opportunity comes up,
we have to grab it."</p>

<p id="id02522">"Agreed.  And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by
a promising opportunity?"</p>

<p id="id02523">"One that leads the Nautilus on a cloudy night within a short
distance of some European coast."</p>

<p id="id02524">"And you'll try to get away by swimming?"</p>

<p id="id02525">"Yes, if we're close enough to shore and the ship's afloat on
the surface.  No, if we're well out and the ship's navigating
under the waters."</p>

<p id="id02526">"And in that event?"</p>

<p id="id02527">"In that event I'll try to get hold of the skiff.  I know how to
handle it.  We'll stick ourselves inside, undo the bolts, and rise
to the surface, without the helmsman in the bow seeing a thing."</p>

<p id="id02528">"Fine, Ned.  Stay on the lookout for such an opportunity,
but don't forget, one slipup will finish us."</p>

<p id="id02529">"I won't forget, sir."</p>

<p id="id02530">"And now, Ned, would you like to know my overall thinking on your plan?"</p>

<p id="id02531">"Gladly, Professor Aronnax."</p>

<p id="id02532">"Well then, I think&#8212;and I don't mean 'I hope'&#8212;that your promising
opportunity won't ever arise."</p>

<p id="id02533">"Why not?"</p>

<p id="id02534">"Because Captain Nemo recognizes that we haven't given up all
hope of recovering our freedom, and he'll keep on his guard,
above all in seas within sight of the coasts of Europe."</p>

<p id="id02535">"I'm of master's opinion," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id02536">"We'll soon see," Ned Land replied, shaking his head with
a determined expression.</p>

<p id="id02537">"And now, Ned Land," I added, "let's leave it at that.  Not another word
on any of this.  The day you're ready, alert us and we're with you.
I turn it all over to you."</p>

<p id="id02538">That's how we ended this conversation, which later was to have
such serious consequences.  At first, I must say, events seemed
to confirm my forecasts, much to the Canadian's despair.
Did Captain Nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas,
or did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships
of every nation that plowed the Mediterranean?  I have no idea,
but usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast.
Either the Nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge,
or it slipped away to the lower depths, although, between the
Greek Islands and Asia Minor, we didn't find bottom even at
2,000 meters down.</p>

<p id="id02539">Accordingly, I became aware of the isle of Karpathos, one of
the Sporades Islands, only when Captain Nemo placed his finger
over a spot on the world map and quoted me this verse from Virgil:</p>

<p id="id02540">Est in Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates</p>

<p id="id02541">Caeruleus Proteus . . .<a id="noteref-2b" href="twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-seas-18.html#note-2b">[2]</a></p>

<p id="id02543">It was indeed that bygone abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of
King Neptune's flocks:  an island located between Rhodes and Crete,
which Greeks now call Karpathos, Italians Scarpanto.  Through the lounge
window I could see only its granite bedrock.</p>

<p id="id02544">The next day, February 14, I decided to spend a few hours studying
the fish of this island group; but for whatever reason, the panels
remained hermetically sealed.  After determining the Nautilus's heading,
I noted that it was proceeding toward the ancient island of Crete,
also called Candia.  At the time I had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln,
this whole island was in rebellion against its tyrannical rulers,
the Ottoman Empire of Turkey.  But since then I had absolutely no idea
what happened to this revolution, and Captain Nemo, deprived of all
contact with the shore, was hardly the man to keep me informed.</p>

<p id="id02545">So I didn't allude to this event when, that evening, I chanced to be
alone with the captain in the lounge.  Besides, he seemed silent
and preoccupied.  Then, contrary to custom, he ordered that both
panels in the lounge be opened, and going from the one to the other,
he carefully observed the watery mass.  For what purpose?
I hadn't a guess, and for my part, I spent my time studying the fish
that passed before my eyes.</p>

<p id="id02546">Among others I noted that sand goby mentioned by Aristotle and commonly
known by the name sea loach, which is encountered exclusively in the salty
waters next to the Nile Delta.  Near them some semiphosphorescent red
porgy rolled by, a variety of gilthead that the Egyptians ranked among
their sacred animals, lauding them in religious ceremonies when their
arrival in the river's waters announced the fertile flood season.
I also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro, three decimeters long,
bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed
with red spots; they're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables,
which gives them an exquisite flavor; hence these tapiro were much
in demand by the epicures of ancient Rome, and their entrails
were dressed with brains of peacock, tongue of flamingo,
and testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured
the Roman emperor Vitellius.</p>

<p id="id02547">Another resident of these seas caught my attention and revived
all my memories of antiquity.  This was the remora, which travels
attached to the bellies of sharks; as the ancients tell it,
when these little fish cling to the undersides of a ship, they can
bring it to a halt, and by so impeding</p>

<p id="id02548">Mark Antony's vessel during the Battle of Actium, one of them facilitated
the victory of Augustus Caesar.  From such slender threads hang
the destinies of nations!  I also observed some wonderful snappers
belonging to the order Lutianida, sacred fish for the Greeks, who claimed
they could drive off sea monsters from the waters they frequent;
their Greek name anthias means "flower," and they live up to it
in the play of their colors and in those fleeting reflections that
turn their dorsal fins into watered silk; their hues are confined
to a gamut of reds, from the pallor of pink to the glow of ruby.
I couldn't take my eyes off these marine wonders, when I was suddenly
jolted by an unexpected apparition.</p>

<p id="id02549">In the midst of the waters, a man appeared, a diver carrying a little
leather bag at his belt.  It was no corpse lost in the waves.
It was a living man, swimming vigorously, sometimes disappearing
to breathe at the surface, then instantly diving again.</p>

<p id="id02550">I turned to Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice:</p>

<p id="id02551">"A man!  A castaway!"  I exclaimed.  "We must rescue him at all cost!"</p>

<p id="id02552">The captain didn't reply but went to lean against the window.</p>

<p id="id02553">The man drew near, and gluing his face to the panel, he stared at us.</p>

<p id="id02554">To my deep astonishment, Captain Nemo gave him a signal.
The diver answered with his hand, immediately swam up to the surface
of the sea, and didn't reappear.</p>

<p id="id02555">"Don't be alarmed," the captain told me.  "That's Nicolas from
Cape Matapan, nicknamed 'Il Pesce.'<a id="noteref-3b" href="twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-seas-18.html#note-3b">[3]</a> He's well known throughout
the Cyclades Islands.  A bold diver!  Water is his true element,
and he lives in the sea more than on shore, going constantly from
one island to another, even to Crete."</p>

<p id="id02557">"You know him, captain?"</p>

<p id="id02558">"Why not, Professor Aronnax?"</p>

<p id="id02559">This said, Captain Nemo went to a cabinet standing near the lounge's
left panel.  Next to this cabinet I saw a chest bound with hoops
of iron, its lid bearing a copper plaque that displayed the Nautilus's
monogram with its motto Mobilis in Mobili.</p>

<p id="id02560">Just then, ignoring my presence, the captain opened this cabinet,
a sort of safe that contained a large number of ingots.</p>

<p id="id02561">They were gold ingots.  And they represented an enormous sum of money.
Where had this precious metal come from?  How had the captain
amassed this gold, and what was he about to do with it?</p>

<p id="id02562">I didn't pronounce a word.  I gaped.  Captain Nemo took out the ingots
one by one and arranged them methodically inside the chest, filling it
to the top.  At which point I estimate that it held more than 1,000
kilograms of gold, in other words, close to 5,000,000 francs.</p>

<p id="id02563">After securely fastening the chest, Captain Nemo wrote an address
on its lid in characters that must have been modern Greek.</p>

<p id="id02564">This done, the captain pressed a button whose wiring was in
communication with the crew's quarters.  Four men appeared and,
not without difficulty, pushed the chest out of the lounge.
Then I heard them hoist it up the iron companionway by means of pulleys.</p>

<p id="id02565">Just then Captain Nemo turned to me:</p>

<p id="id02566">"You were saying, professor?" he asked me.</p>

<p id="id02567">"I wasn't saying a thing, captain."</p>

<p id="id02568">"Then, sir, with your permission, I'll bid you good evening."</p>

<p id="id02569">And with that, Captain Nemo left the lounge.</p>

<p id="id02570">I reentered my stateroom, very puzzled, as you can imagine.
I tried in vain to fall asleep.  I kept searching for a relationship
between the appearance of the diver and that chest filled with gold.
Soon, from certain rolling and pitching movements, I sensed that
the Nautilus had left the lower strata and was back on the surface
of the water.</p>

<p id="id02571">Then I heard the sound of footsteps on the platform.<br/>

I realized that the skiff was being detached and launched to sea.<br/>

For an instant it bumped the Nautilus's side, then all sounds ceased.<br/></p>

<p id="id02572">Two hours later, the same noises, the same comings and goings,
were repeated.  Hoisted on board, the longboat was readjusted into
its socket, and the Nautilus plunged back beneath the waves.</p>

<p id="id02573">So those millions had been delivered to their address.  At what spot
on the continent?  Who was the recipient of Captain Nemo's gold?</p>

<p id="id02574">The next day I related the night's events to Conseil and the Canadian,
events that had aroused my curiosity to a fever pitch.
My companions were as startled as I was.</p>

<p id="id02575">"But where does he get those millions?"  Ned Land asked.</p>

<p id="id02576">To this no reply was possible.  After breakfast I made my way
to the lounge and went about my work.  I wrote up my notes until
five o'clock in the afternoon.  Just then&#8212;was it due to some
personal indisposition?&#8212;I felt extremely hot and had to take off
my jacket made of fan mussel fabric.  A perplexing circumstance
because we weren't in the low latitudes, and besides, once the Nautilus
was submerged, it shouldn't be subject to any rise in temperature.
I looked at the pressure gauge.  It marked a depth of sixty feet,
a depth beyond the reach of atmospheric heat.</p>

<p id="id02577">I kept on working, but the temperature rose to the point
of becoming unbearable.</p>

<p id="id02578">"Could there be a fire on board?"  I wondered.</p>

<p id="id02579">I was about to leave the lounge when Captain Nemo entered.<br/>

He approached the thermometer, consulted it, and turned to me:<br/></p>

<p id="id02580">"42 degrees centigrade," he said.</p>

<p id="id02581">"I've detected as much, captain," I replied, "and if it gets even
slightly hotter, we won't be able to stand it."</p>

<p id="id02582">"Oh, professor, it won't get any hotter unless we want it to!"</p>

<p id="id02583">"You mean you can control this heat?"</p>

<p id="id02584">"No, but I can back away from the fireplace producing it."</p>

<p id="id02585">"So it's outside?"</p>

<p id="id02586">"Surely.  We're cruising in a current of boiling water."</p>

<p id="id02587">"It can't be!"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id02588">"Look."</p>

<p id="id02589">The panels had opened, and I could see a completely white
sea around the Nautilus.  Steaming sulfurous fumes uncoiled
in the midst of waves bubbling like water in a boiler.
I leaned my hand against one of the windows, but the heat was so great,
I had to snatch it back.</p>

<p id="id02590">"Where are we?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id02591">"Near the island of Santorini, professor," the captain answered me,
"and right in the channel that separates the volcanic islets
of Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni.  I wanted to offer you the unusual
sight of an underwater eruption."</p>

<p id="id02592">"I thought," I said, "that the formation of such new islands had
come to an end."</p>

<p id="id02593">"Nothing ever comes to an end in these volcanic waterways,"
Captain Nemo replied, "and thanks to its underground fires,
our globe is continuously under construction in these regions.
According to the Latin historians Cassiodorus and Pliny, by the year
19 of the Christian era, a new island, the divine Thera, had already
appeared in the very place these islets have more recently formed.
Then Thera sank under the waves, only to rise and sink once more
in the year 69 A.D. From that day to this, such plutonic construction
work has been in abeyance.  But on February 3, 1866, a new islet
named George Island emerged in the midst of sulfurous steam near
Nea Kameni and was fused to it on the 6th of the same month.
Seven days later, on February 13, the islet of Aphroessa appeared,
leaving a ten-meter channel between itself and Nea Kameni.  I was
in these seas when that phenomenon occurred and I was able to observe
its every phase.  The islet of Aphroessa was circular in shape,
measuring 300 feet in diameter and thirty feet in height.
It was made of black, glassy lava mixed with bits of feldspar.
Finally, on March 10, a smaller islet called Reka appeared next to
Nea Kameni, and since then, these three islets have fused to form
one single, selfsame island."</p>

<p id="id02594">"What about this channel we're in right now?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id02595">"Here it is," Captain Nemo replied, showing me a chart of the
Greek Islands.  "You observe that I've entered the new islets
in their place."</p>

<p id="id02596">"But will this channel fill up one day?"</p>

<p id="id02597">"Very likely, Professor Aronnax, because since 1866 eight little
lava islets have surged up in front of the port of St. Nicolas
on Palea Kameni.  So it's obvious that Nea and Palea will join
in days to come.  In the middle of the Pacific, tiny infusoria
build continents, but here they're built by volcanic phenomena.
Look, sir!  Look at the construction work going on under these waves."</p>

<p id="id02598">I returned to the window.  The Nautilus was no longer moving.
The heat had become unbearable.  From the white it had recently been,
the sea was turning red, a coloration caused by the presence
of iron salts.  Although the lounge was hermetically sealed, it was
filling with an intolerable stink of sulfur, and I could see scarlet
flames of such brightness, they overpowered our electric light.</p>

<p id="id02599">I was swimming in perspiration, I was stifling, I was about to be cooked.<br/>

Yes, I felt myself cooking in actual fact!<br/></p>

<p id="id02600">"We can't stay any longer in this boiling water," I told the captain.</p>

<p id="id02601">"No, it wouldn't be advisable," replied Nemo the Emotionless.</p>

<p id="id02602">He gave an order.  The Nautilus tacked about and retreated from this
furnace it couldn't brave with impunity.  A quarter of an hour later,
we were breathing fresh air on the surface of the waves.</p>

<p id="id02603">It then occurred to me that if Ned had chosen these waterways
for our escape attempt, we wouldn't have come out alive from this
sea of fire.</p>

<p id="id02604">The next day, February 16, we left this basin, which tallies depths
of 3,000 meters between Rhodes and Alexandria, and passing well out
from Cerigo Island after doubling Cape Matapan, the Nautilus left
the Greek Islands behind.</p>

<h2 id="id02605">CHAPTER 7</h2>

<h6 id="id02606">The Mediterranean in Forty-Eight Hours</h6>

<p id="id02607">THE MEDITERRANEAN, your ideal blue sea:  to Greeks simply "the sea,"
to Hebrews "the great sea," to Romans mare nostrum.<a id="noteref-4b" href="twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-seas-18.html#note-4b">[4]</a> Bordered
by orange trees, aloes, cactus, and maritime pine trees,
perfumed with the scent of myrtle, framed by rugged mountains,
saturated with clean, transparent air but continuously under
construction by fires in the earth, this sea is a genuine battlefield
where Neptune and Pluto still struggle for world domination.
Here on these beaches and waters, says the French historian Michelet,
a man is revived by one of the most invigorating climates in the world.</p>

<p id="id02609">But as beautiful as it was, I could get only a quick look at this
basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers.
Even Captain Nemo's personal insights were denied me,
because that mystifying individual didn't appear one single time
during our high-speed crossing.  I estimate that the Nautilus
covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea,
and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty-four hours times two.
Departing from the waterways of Greece on the morning of February 16,
we cleared the Strait of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.</p>

<p id="id02610">It was obvious to me that this Mediterranean, pinned in the middle
of those shores he wanted to avoid, gave Captain Nemo no pleasure.
Its waves and breezes brought back too many memories, if not too
many regrets.  Here he no longer had the ease of movement and freedom
of maneuver that the oceans allowed him, and his Nautilus felt
cramped so close to the coasts of both Africa and Europe.</p>

<p id="id02611">Accordingly, our speed was twenty-five miles (that is,
twelve four-kilometer leagues) per hour.  Needless to say,
Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress.
Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second,
he could hardly make use of the skiff.  Leaving the Nautilus
under these conditions would have been like jumping off a train
racing at this speed, a rash move if there ever was one.
Moreover, to renew our air supply, the submersible rose to the surface
of the waves only at night, and relying solely on compass and log,
it steered by dead reckoning.</p>

<p id="id02612">Inside the Mediterranean, then, I could catch no more of
its fast-passing scenery than a traveler might see from an
express train; in other words, I could view only the distant
horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning.
But Conseil and I were able to observe those Mediterranean fish
whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the Nautilus's waters.
We stayed on watch before the lounge windows, and our notes enable
me to reconstruct, in a few words, the ichthyology of this sea.</p>

<p id="id02613">Among the various fish inhabiting it, some I viewed, others I glimpsed,
and the rest I missed completely because of the Nautilus's speed.
Kindly allow me to sort them out using this whimsical system
of classification.  It will at least convey the quickness
of my observations.</p>

<p id="id02614">In the midst of the watery mass, brightly lit by our electric beams,
there snaked past those one-meter lampreys that are common
to nearly every clime.  A type of ray from the genus Oxyrhynchus,
five feet wide, had a white belly with a spotted, ash-gray back
and was carried along by the currents like a huge, wide-open shawl.
Other rays passed by so quickly I couldn't tell if they deserved that
name "eagle ray" coined by the ancient Greeks, or those designations
of "rat ray," "bat ray," and "toad ray" that modern fishermen
have inflicted on them.  Dogfish known as topes, twelve feet long
and especially feared by divers, were racing with each other.
Looking like big bluish shadows, thresher sharks went by,
eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell.
Dorados from the genus Sparus, some measuring up to thirteen
decimeters, appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled
with ribbons, which contrasted with the dark color of their fins;
fish sacred to the goddess Venus, their eyes set in brows of gold;
a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt,
equally at home in rivers, lakes, and oceans, living in every clime,
tolerating any temperature, their line dating back to prehistoric times
on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far-off days.
Magnificent sturgeons, nine to ten meters long and extremely fast,
banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels,
showing bluish backs with small brown spots; they resemble sharks,
without equaling their strength, and are encountered in every sea;
in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers,
fighting the currents of the Volga, Danube, Po, Rhine, Loire, and Oder,
while feeding on herring, mackerel, salmon, and codfish; although they
belong to the class of cartilaginous fish, they rate as a delicacy;
they're eaten fresh, dried, marinated, or salt-preserved,
and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of
the Roman epicure Lucullus.</p>

<p id="id02615">But whenever the Nautilus drew near the surface, those denizens
of the Mediterranean I could observe most productively belonged
to the sixty-third genus of bony fish.  These were tuna from
the genus Scomber, blue-black on top, silver on the belly armor,
their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam.  They are said to
follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun,
and they did just that with the Nautilus, as they had once done
with the vessels of the Count de La P&#233;rouse. For long hours they
competed in speed with our submersible.  I couldn't stop marveling
at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing, their heads small,
their bodies sleek, spindle-shaped, and in some cases over three
meters long, their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength,
their caudal fins forked.  Like certain flocks of birds, whose speed
they equal, these tuna swim in triangle formation, which prompted
the ancients to say they'd boned up on geometry and military strategy.
And yet they can't escape the Proven&#231;al fishermen, who prize them
as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of Turkey and Italy;
and these valuable animals, as oblivious as if they were deaf
and blind, leap right into the Marseilles tuna nets and perish
by the thousands.</p>

<p id="id02616">Just for the record, I'll mention those Mediterranean fish
that Conseil and I barely glimpsed.  There were whitish eels
of the species Gymnotus fasciatus that passed like elusive wisps
of steam, conger eels three to four meters long that were tricked
out in green, blue, and yellow, three-foot hake with a liver
that makes a dainty morsel, wormfish drifting like thin seaweed,
sea robins that poets call lyrefish and seamen pipers and whose snouts
have two jagged triangular plates shaped like old Homer's lyre,
swallowfish swimming as fast as the bird they're named after,
redheaded groupers whose dorsal fins are trimmed with filaments,
some shad (spotted with black, gray, brown, blue, yellow, and green)
that actually respond to tinkling handbells, splendid diamond-shaped
turbot that were like aquatic pheasants with yellowish fins stippled
in brown and the left topside mostly marbled in brown and yellow,
finally schools of wonderful red mullet, real oceanic birds of paradise
that ancient Romans bought for as much as 10,000 sesterces apiece,
and which they killed at the table, so they could heartlessly watch it
change color from cinnabar red when alive to pallid white when dead.</p>

<p id="id02617">And as for other fish common to the Atlantic and Mediterranean, I was
unable to observe miralets, triggerfish, puffers, seahorses,
jewelfish, trumpetfish, blennies, gray mullet, wrasse, smelt,
flying fish, anchovies, sea bream, porgies, garfish, or any of
the chief representatives of the order Pleuronecta, such as sole,
flounder, plaice, dab, and brill, simply because of the dizzying
speed with which the Nautilus hustled through these opulent waters.</p>

<p id="id02618">As for marine mammals, on passing by the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, I
thought I recognized two or three sperm whales equipped with the single
dorsal fin denoting the genus Physeter, some pilot whales from
the genus Globicephalus exclusive to the Mediterranean, the forepart
of the head striped with small distinct lines, and also a dozen
seals with white bellies and black coats, known by the name monk
seals and just as solemn as if they were three-meter Dominicans.</p>

<p id="id02619">For his part, Conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide<br/>

and adorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise.<br/>

I was sorry to miss this reptile, because from Conseil's description,<br/>

I believe I recognized the leatherback turtle, a pretty rare species.<br/>

For my part, I noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces.<br/></p>

<p id="id02620">As for zoophytes, for a few moments I was able to marvel at a wonderful,
orange-hued hydra from the genus Galeolaria that clung to the glass
of our port panel; it consisted of a long, lean filament that spread
out into countless branches and ended in the most delicate lace
ever spun by the followers of Arachne.  Unfortunately I couldn't
fish up this wonderful specimen, and surely no other Mediterranean
zoophytes would have been offered to my gaze, if, on the evening
of the 16th, the Nautilus hadn't slowed down in an odd fashion.
This was the situation.</p>

<p id="id02621">By then we were passing between Sicily and the coast
of Tunisia.  In the cramped space between Cape Bon and the
Strait of Messina, the sea bottom rises almost all at once.
It forms an actual ridge with only seventeen meters of water
remaining above it, while the depth on either side is 170 meters.
Consequently, the Nautilus had to maneuver with caution so as not
to bump into this underwater barrier.</p>

<p id="id02622">I showed Conseil the position of this long reef on our chart
of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p id="id02623">"But with all due respect to master," Conseil ventured to observe,
"it's like an actual isthmus connecting Europe to Africa."</p>

<p id="id02624">"Yes, my boy," I replied, "it cuts across the whole Strait of Sicily,
and Smith's soundings prove that in the past, these two continents
were genuinely connected between Cape Boeo and Cape Farina."</p>

<p id="id02625">"I can easily believe it," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id02626">"I might add," I went on, "that there's a similar barrier between
Gibraltar and Ceuta, and in prehistoric times it closed off
the Mediterranean completely."</p>

<p id="id02627">"Gracious!"  Conseil put in.  "Suppose one day some volcanic upheaval
raises these two barriers back above the waves!"</p>

<p id="id02628">"That's most unlikely, Conseil."</p>

<p id="id02629">"If master will allow me to finish, I mean that if this phenomenon occurs,
it might prove distressing to Mr. de Lesseps, who has gone to such
pains to cut through his isthmus!"</p>

<p id="id02630">"Agreed, but I repeat, Conseil:  such a phenomenon won't occur.
The intensity of these underground forces continues to diminish.
Volcanoes were quite numerous in the world's early days, but they're
going extinct one by one; the heat inside the earth is growing weaker,
the temperature in the globe's lower strata is cooling appreciably
every century, and to our globe's detriment, because its heat
is its life."</p>

<p id="id02631">"But the sun&#8212;"</p>

<p id="id02632">"The sun isn't enough, Conseil.  Can it restore heat to a corpse?"</p>

<p id="id02633">"Not that I've heard."</p>

<p id="id02634">"Well, my friend, someday the earth will be just such a cold corpse.
Like the moon, which long ago lost its vital heat, our globe will
become lifeless and unlivable."</p>

<p id="id02635">"In how many centuries?"  Conseil asked.</p>

<p id="id02636">"In hundreds of thousands of years, my boy."</p>

<p id="id02637">"Then we have ample time to finish our voyage," Conseil replied,
"if Ned Land doesn't mess things up!"</p>

<p id="id02638">Thus reassured, Conseil went back to studying the shallows that
the Nautilus was skimming at moderate speed.</p>

<p id="id02639">On the rocky, volcanic seafloor, there bloomed quite a collection
of moving flora:  sponges, sea cucumbers, jellyfish called sea
gooseberries that were adorned with reddish tendrils and gave off
a subtle phosphorescence, members of the genus Beroe that are commonly
known by the name melon jellyfish and are bathed in the shimmer
of the whole solar spectrum, free-swimming crinoids one meter wide
that reddened the waters with their crimson hue, treelike basket
stars of the greatest beauty, sea fans from the genus Pavonacea
with long stems, numerous edible sea urchins of various species,
plus green sea anemones with a grayish trunk and a brown disk lost
beneath the olive-colored tresses of their tentacles.</p>

<p id="id02640">Conseil kept especially busy observing mollusks and articulates,
and although his catalog is a little dry, I wouldn't want to wrong
the gallant lad by leaving out his personal observations.</p>

<p id="id02641">From the branch Mollusca, he mentions numerous comb-shaped scallops,
hooflike spiny oysters piled on top of each other, triangular coquina,
three-pronged glass snails with yellow fins and transparent shells,
orange snails from the genus Pleurobranchus that looked like eggs spotted
or speckled with greenish dots, members of the genus Aplysia also known
by the name sea hares, other sea hares from the genus Dolabella,
plump paper-bubble shells, umbrella shells exclusive to the Mediterranean,
abalone whose shell produces a mother-of-pearl much in demand,
pilgrim scallops, saddle shells that diners in the French
province of Languedoc are said to like better than oysters,
some of those cockleshells so dear to the citizens of Marseilles,
fat white venus shells that are among the clams so abundant off
the coasts of North America and eaten in such quantities by New Yorkers,
variously colored comb shells with gill covers, burrowing date
mussels with a peppery flavor I relish, furrowed heart cockles whose
shells have riblike ridges on their arching summits, triton shells
pocked with scarlet bumps, carniaira snails with backward-curving
tips that make them resemble flimsy gondolas, crowned ferola snails,
atlanta snails with spiral shells, gray nudibranchs from the genus
Tethys that were spotted with white and covered by fringed mantles,
nudibranchs from the suborder Eolidea that looked like small slugs,
sea butterflies crawling on their backs, seashells from the genus Auricula
including the oval-shaped Auricula myosotis, tan wentletrap snails,
common periwinkles, violet snails, cineraira snails, rock borers,
ear shells, cabochon snails, pandora shells, etc.</p>

<p id="id02642">As for the articulates, in his notes Conseil has very appropriately
divided them into six classes, three of which belong to the marine world.
These classes are the Crustacea, Cirripedia, and Annelida.</p>

<p id="id02643">Crustaceans are subdivided into nine orders, and the first of
these consists of the decapods, in other words, animals whose head
and thorax are usually fused, whose cheek-and-mouth mechanism is
made up of several pairs of appendages, and whose thorax has four,
five, or six pairs of walking legs.  Conseil used the methods
of our mentor Professor Milne-Edwards, who puts the decapods
in three divisions:  Brachyura, Macrura, and Anomura.  These names
may look a tad fierce, but they're accurate and appropriate.
Among the Brachyura, Conseil mentions some amanthia crabs whose fronts
were armed with two big diverging tips, those inachus scorpions that&#8212;
lord knows why&#8212;symbolized wisdom to the ancient Greeks, spider crabs
of the massena and spinimane varieties that had probably gone astray
in these shallows because they usually live in the lower depths,
xanthid crabs, pilumna crabs, rhomboid crabs, granular box crabs
(easy on the digestion, as Conseil ventured to observe), toothless
masked crabs, ebalia crabs, cymopolia crabs, woolly-handed crabs, etc.
Among the Macrura (which are subdivided into five families:
hardshells, burrowers, crayfish, prawns, and ghost crabs)
Conseil mentions some common spiny lobsters whose females supply a meat
highly prized, slipper lobsters or common shrimp, waterside gebia shrimp,
and all sorts of edible species, but he says nothing of the crayfish
subdivision that includes the true lobster, because spiny lobsters
are the only type in the Mediterranean.  Finally, among the Anomura,
he saw common drocina crabs dwelling inside whatever abandoned
seashells they could take over, homola crabs with spiny fronts,
hermit crabs, hairy porcelain crabs, etc.</p>

<p id="id02644">There Conseil's work came to a halt.  He didn't have time to finish
off the class Crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods,
amphipods, homopods, isopods, trilobites, branchiopods, ostracods,
and entomostraceans.  And in order to complete his study of
marine articulates, he needed to mention the class Cirripedia,
which contains water fleas and carp lice, plus the class Annelida,
which he would have divided without fail into tubifex worms and
dorsibranchian worms.  But having gone past the shallows of the Strait
of Sicily, the Nautilus resumed its usual deep-water speed.
From then on, no more mollusks, no more zoophytes, no more articulates.
Just a few large fish sweeping by like shadows.</p>

<p id="id02645">During the night of February 16-17, we entered the second<br/>

Mediterranean basin, whose maximum depth we found at 3,000 meters.<br/>

The Nautilus, driven downward by its propeller and slanting fins,<br/>

descended to the lowest strata of this sea.<br/></p>

<p id="id02646">There, in place of natural wonders, the watery mass offered
some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes.  In essence,
we were then crossing that part of the whole Mediterranean so fertile
in casualties.  From the coast of Algiers to the beaches of Provence,
how many ships have wrecked, how many vessels have vanished!
Compared to the vast liquid plains of the Pacific, the Mediterranean
is a mere lake, but it's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves,
today kindly and affectionate to those frail single-masters drifting
between a double ultramarine of sky and water, tomorrow bad-tempered
and turbulent, agitated by the winds, demolishing the strongest
ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop.</p>

<p id="id02647">So, in our swift cruise through these deep strata, how many vessels I
saw lying on the seafloor, some already caked with coral, others clad
only in a layer of rust, plus anchors, cannons, shells, iron fittings,
propeller blades, parts of engines, cracked cylinders, staved-in boilers,
then hulls floating in midwater, here upright, there overturned.</p>

<p id="id02648">Some of these wrecked ships had perished in collisions, others from
hitting granite reefs.  I saw a few that had sunk straight down,
their masting still upright, their rigging stiffened by the water.
They looked like they were at anchor by some immense, open,
offshore mooring where they were waiting for their departure time.
When the Nautilus passed between them, covering them with sheets
of electricity, they seemed ready to salute us with their colors
and send us their serial numbers!  But no, nothing but silence
and death filled this field of catastrophes!</p>

<p id="id02649">I observed that these Mediterranean depths became more and more
cluttered with such gruesome wreckage as the Nautilus drew nearer
to the Strait of Gibraltar.  By then the shores of Africa and Europe
were converging, and in this narrow space collisions were commonplace.
There I saw numerous iron undersides, the phantasmagoric ruins
of steamers, some lying down, others rearing up like fearsome animals.
One of these boats made a dreadful first impression:
sides torn open, funnel bent, paddle wheels stripped to the mountings,
rudder separated from the sternpost and still hanging from an
iron chain, the board on its stern eaten away by marine salts!
How many lives were dashed in this shipwreck!  How many victims
were swept under the waves!  Had some sailor on board lived
to tell the story of this dreadful disaster, or do the waves still
keep this casualty a secret?  It occurred to me, lord knows why,
that this boat buried under the sea might have been the Atlas,
lost with all hands some twenty years ago and never heard from again!
Oh, what a gruesome tale these Mediterranean depths could tell,
this huge boneyard where so much wealth has been lost, where so many
victims have met their deaths!</p>

<p id="id02650">Meanwhile, briskly unconcerned, the Nautilus ran at full propeller
through the midst of these ruins.  On February 18, near three o'clock
in the morning, it hove before the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar.</p>

<p id="id02651">There are two currents here:  an upper current, long known to exist,
that carries the ocean's waters into the Mediterranean basin;
then a lower countercurrent, the only present-day proof of its existence
being logic.  In essence, the Mediterranean receives a continual influx
of water not only from the Atlantic but from rivers emptying into it;
since local evaporation isn't enough to restore the balance, the total
amount of added water should make this sea's level higher every year.
Yet this isn't the case, and we're naturally forced to believe in
the existence of some lower current that carries the Mediterranean's
surplus through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic basin.</p>

<p id="id02652">And so it turned out.  The Nautilus took full advantage of
this countercurrent.  It advanced swiftly through this narrow passageway.
For an instant I could glimpse the wonderful ruins of the Temple
of Hercules, buried undersea, as Pliny and Avianus have mentioned,
together with the flat island they stand on; and a few minutes later,
we were floating on the waves of the Atlantic.</p>
