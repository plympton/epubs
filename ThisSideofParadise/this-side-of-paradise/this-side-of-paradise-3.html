<p>It was still a music, though, infinitely sorrowful.</p>
<p>Ten o'clock found them penniless. They had suppered greatly on their last eleven cents and, singing, strolled up through the casinos and lighted arches on the boardwalk, stopping to listen approvingly to all band concerts. In one place Kerry took up a collection for the French War Orphans which netted a dollar and twenty cents, and with this they bought some brandy in case they caught cold in the night. They finished the day in a moving-picture show and went into solemn systematic roars of laughter at an ancient comedy, to the startled annoyance of the rest of the audience. Their entrance was distinctly strategic, for each man as he entered pointed reproachfully at the one just behind him. Sloane, bringing up the rear, disclaimed all knowledge and responsibility as soon as the others were scattered inside; then as the irate ticket-taker rushed in he followed nonchalantly.</p>
<p>They reassembled later by the Casino and made arrangements for the night. Kerry wormed permission from the watchman to sleep on the platform and, having collected a huge pile of rugs from the booths to serve as mattresses and blankets, they talked until midnight, and then fell into a dreamless sleep, though Amory tried hard to stay awake and watch that marvellous moon settle on the sea.</p>
<p>So they progressed for two happy days, up and down the shore by street-car or machine, or by shoe-leather on the crowded boardwalk; sometimes eating with the wealthy, more frequently dining frugally at the expense of an unsuspecting restaurateur. They had their photos taken, eight poses, in a quick-development store. Kerry insisted on grouping them as a "varsity" football team, and then as a tough gang from the East Side, with their coats inside out, and himself sitting in the middle on a cardboard moon. The photographer probably has them yet&#8212;at least, they never called for them. The weather was perfect, and again they slept outside, and again Amory fell unwillingly asleep.</p>
<p>Sunday broke stolid and respectable, and even the sea seemed to mumble and complain, so they returned to Princeton via the Fords of transient farmers, and broke up with colds in their heads, but otherwise none the worse for wandering.</p>
<p>Even more than in the year before, Amory neglected his work, not deliberately but lazily and through a multitude of other interests. Co-ordinate geometry and the melancholy hexameters of Corneille and Racine held forth small allurements, and even psychology, which he had eagerly awaited, proved to be a dull subject full of muscular reactions and biological phrases rather than the study of personality and influence. That was a noon class, and it always sent him dozing. Having found that "subjective and objective, sir," answered most of the questions, he used the phrase on all occasions, and it became the class joke when, on a query being levelled at him, he was nudged awake by Ferrenby or Sloane to gasp it out.</p>
<p>Mostly there were parties&#8212;to Orange or the Shore, more rarely to New York and Philadelphia, though one night they marshalled fourteen waitresses out of Childs' and took them to ride down Fifth Avenue on top of an auto bus. They all cut more classes than were allowed, which meant an additional course the following year, but spring was too rare to let anything interfere with their colorful ramblings. In May Amory was elected to the Sophomore Prom Committee, and when after a long evening's discussion with Alec they made out a tentative list of class probabilities for the senior council, they placed themselves among the surest. The senior council was composed presumably of the eighteen most representative seniors, and in view of Alec's football managership and Amory's chance of nosing out Burne Holiday as Princetonian chairman, they seemed fairly justified in this presumption. Oddly enough, they both placed D'Invilliers as among the possibilities, a guess that a year before the class would have gaped at.</p>
<p>All through the spring Amory had kept up an intermittent correspondence with Isabelle Borge, punctuated by violent squabbles and chiefly enlivened by his attempts to find new words for love. He discovered Isabelle to be discreetly and aggravatingly unsentimental in letters, but he hoped against hope that she would prove not too exotic a bloom to fit the large spaces of spring as she had fitted the den in the Minnehaha Club. During May he wrote thirty-page documents almost nightly, and sent them to her in bulky envelopes exteriorly labelled "Part I" and "Part II."</p>
<p>"Oh, Alec, I believe I'm tired of college," he said sadly, as they walked the dusk together.</p>
<p>"I think I am, too, in a way."</p>
<p>"All I'd like would be a little home in the country, some warm country, and a wife, and just enough to do to keep from rotting."</p>
<p>"Me, too."</p>
<p>"I'd like to quit."</p>
<p>"What does your girl say?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" Amory gasped in horror. "She wouldn't <i>think</i> of marrying... that is, not now. I mean the future, you know."</p>
<p>"My girl would. I'm engaged."</p>
<p>"Are you really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Don't say a word to anybody, please, but I am. I may not come back next year."</p>
<p>"But you're only twenty! Give up college?"</p>
<p>"Why, Amory, you were saying a minute ago&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Yes," Amory interrupted, "but I was just wishing. I wouldn't think of leaving college. It's just that I feel so sad these wonderful nights. I sort of feel they're never coming again, and I'm not really getting all I could out of them. I wish my girl lived here. But marry&#8212;not a chance. Especially as father says the money isn't forthcoming as it used to be."</p>
<p>"What a waste these nights are!" agreed Alec.</p>
<p>But Amory sighed and made use of the nights. He had a snap-shot of Isabelle, enshrined in an old watch, and at eight almost every night he would turn off all the lights except the desk lamp and, sitting by the open windows with the picture before him, write her rapturous letters.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"> ... Oh it's so hard to write you what I really <i>feel</i> when I<br/>&#160; think about you so much; you've gotten to mean to me a <i>dream</i> that<br/>&#160; I can't put on paper any more.&#160; Your last letter came and it was<br/>&#160; wonderful!&#160; I read it over about six times, especially the last<br/>&#160; part, but I do wish, sometimes, you'd be more <i>frank</i> and tell me<br/>&#160; what you really do think of me, yet your last letter was too good<br/>&#160; to be true, and I can hardly wait until June!&#160; Be sure and be able<br/>&#160; to come to the prom.&#160; It'll be fine, I think, and I want to bring<br/>&#160; <i>you</i> just at the end of a wonderful year.&#160; I often think over what<br/>&#160; you said on that night and wonder how much you meant.&#160; If it were<br/>&#160; anyone but you&#8212;but you see I <i>thought</i> you were fickle the first<br/>&#160; time I saw you and you are so popular and everthing that I can't<br/>&#160; imagine you really liking me <i>best</i>.<br/><br/>&#160; Oh, Isabelle, dear&#8212;it's a wonderful night.&#160; Somebody is playing<br/>&#160; "Love Moon" on a mandolin far across the campus, and the music<br/>&#160; seems to bring you into the window.&#160; Now he's playing "Good-by,<br/>&#160; Boys, I'm Through," and how well it suits me.&#160; For I am through<br/>&#160; with everything.&#160; I have decided never to take a cocktail again,<br/>&#160; and I know I'll never again fall in love&#8212;I couldn't&#8212;you've been<br/>&#160; too much a part of my days and nights to ever let me think of<br/>&#160; another girl.&#160; I meet them all the time and they don't interest me.<br/>&#160; I'm not pretending to be blas&#233;, because it's not that.&#160; It's just<br/>&#160; that I'm in love.&#160; Oh, <i>dearest</i> Isabelle (somehow I can't call you<br/>&#160; just Isabelle, and I'm afraid I'll come out with the "dearest"<br/>&#160; before your family this June), you've got to come to the prom,<br/>&#160; and then I'll come up to your house for a day and everything'll be<br/>&#160; perfect....<br/>
</div>
<p>And so on in an eternal monotone that seemed to both of them infinitely charming, infinitely new.</p>
<hr/>
<p>June came and the days grew so hot and lazy that they could not worry even about exams, but spent dreamy evenings on the court of Cottage, talking of long subjects until the sweep of country toward Stony Brook became a blue haze and the lilacs were white around tennis-courts, and words gave way to silent cigarettes.... Then down deserted Prospect and along McCosh with song everywhere around them, up to the hot joviality of Nassau Street.</p>
<p>Tom D'Invilliers and Amory walked late in those days. A gambling fever swept through the sophomore class and they bent over the bones till three o'clock many a sultry night. After one session they came out of Sloane's room to find the dew fallen and the stars old in the sky.</p>
<p>"Let's borrow bicycles and take a ride," Amory suggested.</p>
<p>"All right. I'm not a bit tired and this is almost the last night of the year, really, because the prom stuff starts Monday."</p>
<p>They found two unlocked bicycles in Holder Court and rode out about half-past three along the Lawrenceville Road.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do this summer, Amory?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask me&#8212;same old things, I suppose. A month or two in Lake Geneva&#8212;I'm counting on you to be there in July, you know&#8212;then there'll be Minneapolis, and that means hundreds of summer hops, parlor-snaking, getting bored&#8212;But oh, Tom," he added suddenly, "hasn't this year been slick!"</p>
<p>"No," declared Tom emphatically, a new Tom, clothed by Brooks, shod by Franks, "I've won this game, but I feel as if I never want to play another. You're all right&#8212;you're a rubber ball, and somehow it suits you, but I'm sick of adapting myself to the local snobbishness of this corner of the world. I want to go where people aren't barred because of the color of their neckties and the roll of their coats."</p>
<p>"You can't, Tom," argued Amory, as they rolled along through the scattering night; "wherever you go now you'll always unconsciously apply these standards of 'having it' or 'lacking it.' For better or worse we've stamped you; you're a Princeton type!"</p>
<p>"Well, then," complained Tom, his cracked voice rising plaintively, "why do I have to come back at all? I've learned all that Princeton has to offer. Two years more of mere pedantry and lying around a club aren't going to help. They're just going to disorganize me, conventionalize me completely. Even now I'm so spineless that I wonder how I get away with it."</p>
<p>"Oh, but you're missing the real point, Tom," Amory interrupted. "You've just had your eyes opened to the snobbishness of the world in a rather abrupt manner. Princeton invariably gives the thoughtful man a social sense."</p>
<p>"You consider you taught me that, don't you?" he asked quizzically, eying Amory in the half dark.</p>
<p>Amory laughed quietly.</p>
<p>"Didn't I?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes," he said slowly, "I think you're my bad angel. I might have been a pretty fair poet."</p>
<p>"Come on, that's rather hard. You chose to come to an Eastern college. Either your eyes were opened to the mean scrambling quality of people, or you'd have gone through blind, and you'd hate to have done that&#8212;been like Marty Kaye."</p>
<p>"Yes," he agreed, "you're right. I wouldn't have liked it. Still, it's hard to be made a cynic at twenty."</p>
<p>"I was born one," Amory murmured. "I'm a cynical idealist." He paused and wondered if that meant anything.</p>
<p>They reached the sleeping school of Lawrenceville, and turned to ride back.</p>
<p>"It's good, this ride, isn't it?" Tom said presently.</p>
<p>"Yes; it's a good finish, it's knock-out; everything's good to-night. Oh, for a hot, languorous summer and Isabelle!"</p>
<p>"Oh, you and your Isabelle! I'll bet she's a simple one... let's say some poetry."</p>
<p>So Amory declaimed "The Ode to a Nightingale" to the bushes they passed.</p>
<p>"I'll never be a poet," said Amory as he finished. "I'm not enough of a sensualist really; there are only a few obvious things that I notice as primarily beautiful: women, spring evenings, music at night, the sea; I don't catch the subtle things like 'silver-snarling trumpets.' I may turn out an intellectual, but I'll never write anything but mediocre poetry."</p>
<p>They rode into Princeton as the sun was making colored maps of the sky behind the graduate school, and hurried to the refreshment of a shower that would have to serve in place of sleep. By noon the bright-costumed alumni crowded the streets with their bands and choruses, and in the tents there was great reunion under the orange-and-black banners that curled and strained in the wind. Amory looked long at one house which bore the legend "Sixty-nine." There a few gray-haired men sat and talked quietly while the classes swept by in panorama of life.</p>
<hr/>
<p>UNDER THE ARC-LIGHT</p>
<p>Then tragedy's emerald eyes glared suddenly at Amory over the edge of June. On the night after his ride to Lawrenceville a crowd sallied to New York in quest of adventure, and started back to Princeton about twelve o'clock in two machines. It had been a gay party and different stages of sobriety were represented. Amory was in the car behind; they had taken the wrong road and lost the way, and so were hurrying to catch up.</p>
<p>It was a clear night and the exhilaration of the road went to Amory's head. He had the ghost of two stanzas of a poem forming in his mind. ...</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160; So the gray car crept nightward in the dark and there was no life<br/>&#160; stirred as it went by....&#160; As the still ocean paths before the<br/>&#160; shark in starred and glittering waterways, beauty-high, the<br/>&#160; moon-swathed trees divided, pair on pair, while flapping<br/>&#160; nightbirds cried across the air....<br/><br/>&#160; A moment by an inn of lamps and shades, a yellow inn under a<br/>&#160; yellow moon&#8212;then silence, where crescendo laughter fades... the<br/>&#160; car swung out again to the winds of June, mellowed the shadows<br/>&#160; where the distance grew, then crushed the yellow shadows into<br/>&#160; blue....<br/>
</div>
<p>They jolted to a stop, and Amory peered up, startled. A woman was standing beside the road, talking to Alec at the wheel. Afterward he remembered the harpy effect that her old kimono gave her, and the cracked hollowness of her voice as she spoke:</p>
<p>"You Princeton boys?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, there's one of you killed here, and two others about dead."</p>
<p>"<i>My God!</i>"</p>
<p>"Look!" She pointed and they gazed in horror. Under the full light of a roadside arc-light lay a form, face downward in a widening circle of blood.</p>
<p>They sprang from the car. Amory thought of the back of that head&#8212;that hair&#8212;that hair... and then they turned the form over.</p>
<p>"It's Dick&#8212;Dick Humbird!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Christ!"</p>
<p>"Feel his heart!"</p>
<p>Then the insistent voice of the old crone in a sort of croaking triumph:</p>
<p>"He's quite dead, all right. The car turned over. Two of the men that weren't hurt just carried the others in, but this one's no use."</p>
<p>Amory rushed into the house and the rest followed with a limp mass that they laid on the sofa in the shoddy little front parlor. Sloane, with his shoulder punctured, was on another lounge. He was half delirious, and kept calling something about a chemistry lecture at 8:10.</p>
<p>"I don't know what happened," said Ferrenby in a strained voice. "Dick was driving and he wouldn't give up the wheel; we told him he'd been drinking too much&#8212;then there was this damn curve&#8212;oh, my <i>God!</i>..." He threw himself face downward on the floor and broke into dry sobs.</p>
<p>The doctor had arrived, and Amory went over to the couch, where some one handed him a sheet to put over the body. With a sudden hardness, he raised one of the hands and let it fall back inertly. The brow was cold but the face not expressionless. He looked at the shoe-laces&#8212;Dick had tied them that morning. <i>He</i> had tied them&#8212;and now he was this heavy white mass. All that remained of the charm and personality of the Dick Humbird he had known&#8212;oh, it was all so horrible and unaristocratic and close to the earth. All tragedy has that strain of the grotesque and squalid&#8212;so useless, futile... the way animals die.... Amory was reminded of a cat that had lain horribly mangled in some alley of his childhood.</p>
<p>"Some one go to Princeton with Ferrenby."</p>
<p>Amory stepped outside the door and shivered slightly at the late night wind&#8212;a wind that stirred a broken fender on the mass of bent metal to a plaintive, tinny sound.</p>
<hr/>
<p>CRESCENDO!</p>
<p>Next day, by a merciful chance, passed in a whirl. When Amory was by himself his thoughts zigzagged inevitably to the picture of that red mouth yawning incongruously in the white face, but with a determined effort he piled present excitement upon the memory of it and shut it coldly away from his mind.</p>
<p>Isabelle and her mother drove into town at four, and they rode up smiling Prospect Avenue, through the gay crowd, to have tea at Cottage. The clubs had their annual dinners that night, so at seven he loaned her to a freshman and arranged to meet her in the gymnasium at eleven, when the upper classmen were admitted to the freshman dance. She was all he had expected, and he was happy and eager to make that night the centre of every dream. At nine the upper classes stood in front of the clubs as the freshman torchlight parade rioted past, and Amory wondered if the dress-suited groups against the dark, stately backgrounds and under the flare of the torches made the night as brilliant to the staring, cheering freshmen as it had been to him the year before.</p>
<p>The next day was another whirl. They lunched in a gay party of six in a private dining-room at the club, while Isabelle and Amory looked at each other tenderly over the fried chicken and knew that their love was to be eternal. They danced away the prom until five, and the stags cut in on Isabelle with joyous abandon, which grew more and more enthusiastic as the hour grew late, and their wines, stored in overcoat pockets in the coat room, made old weariness wait until another day. The stag line is a most homogeneous mass of men. It fairly sways with a single soul. A dark-haired beauty dances by and there is a half-gasping sound as the ripple surges forward and some one sleeker than the rest darts out and cuts in. Then when the six-foot girl (brought by Kaye in your class, and to whom he has been trying to introduce you all evening) gallops by, the line surges back and the groups face about and become intent on far corners of the hall, for Kaye, anxious and perspiring, appears elbowing through the crowd in search of familiar faces.</p>
<p>"I say, old man, I've got an awfully nice&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Kaye, but I'm set for this one. I've got to cut in on a fella."</p>
<p>"Well, the next one?"</p>
<p>"What&#8212;ah&#8212;er&#8212;I swear I've got to go cut in&#8212;look me up when she's got a dance free."</p>
<p>It delighted Amory when Isabelle suggested that they leave for a while and drive around in her car. For a delicious hour that passed too soon they glided the silent roads about Princeton and talked from the surface of their hearts in shy excitement. Amory felt strangely ingenuous and made no attempt to kiss her.</p>
<p>Next day they rode up through the Jersey country, had luncheon in New York, and in the afternoon went to see a problem play at which Isabelle wept all through the second act, rather to Amory's embarrassment&#8212;though it filled him with tenderness to watch her. He was tempted to lean over and kiss away her tears, and she slipped her hand into his under cover of darkness to be pressed softly.</p>
<p>Then at six they arrived at the Borges' summer place on Long Island, and Amory rushed up-stairs to change into a dinner coat. As he put in his studs he realized that he was enjoying life as he would probably never enjoy it again. Everything was hallowed by the haze of his own youth. He had arrived, abreast of the best in his generation at Princeton. He was in love and his love was returned. Turning on all the lights, he looked at himself in the mirror, trying to find in his own face the qualities that made him see clearer than the great crowd of people, that made him decide firmly, and able to influence and follow his own will. There was little in his life now that he would have changed. ... Oxford might have been a bigger field.</p>
<p>Silently he admired himself. How conveniently well he looked, and how well a dinner coat became him. He stepped into the hall and then waited at the top of the stairs, for he heard footsteps coming. It was Isabelle, and from the top of her shining hair to her little golden slippers she had never seemed so beautiful.</p>
<p>"Isabelle!" he cried, half involuntarily, and held out his arms. As in the story-books, she ran into them, and on that half-minute, as their lips first touched, rested the high point of vanity, the crest of his young egotism.</p>
<p><a id="link2HCH0003"><!--  H2 anchor --></a></p>
<div class="c3">

<h2 id="dlepubid00004">CHAPTER 3. The Egotist Considers</h2>
<p>"Ouch! Let me go!"</p>
<p>He dropped his arms to his sides.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Your shirt stud&#8212;it hurt me&#8212;look!" She was looking down at her neck, where a little blue spot about the size of a pea marred its pallor.</p>
<p>"Oh, Isabelle," he reproached himself, "I'm a goopher. Really, I'm sorry&#8212;I shouldn't have held you so close."</p>
<p>She looked up impatiently.</p>
<p>"Oh, Amory, of course you couldn't help it, and it didn't hurt much; but what <i>are</i> we going to do about it?"</p>
<p>"<i>Do</i> about it?" he asked. "Oh&#8212;that spot; it'll disappear in a second."</p>
<p>"It isn't," she said, after a moment of concentrated gazing, "it's still there&#8212;and it looks like Old Nick&#8212;oh, Amory, what'll we do! It's <i>just</i> the height of your shoulder."</p>
<p>"Massage it," he suggested, repressing the faintest inclination to laugh.</p>
<p>She rubbed it delicately with the tips of her fingers, and then a tear gathered in the corner of her eye, and slid down her cheek.</p>
<p>"Oh, Amory," she said despairingly, lifting up a most pathetic face, "I'll just make my whole neck <i>flame</i> if I rub it. What'll I do?"</p>
<p>A quotation sailed into his head and he couldn't resist repeating it aloud.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160; "All the perfumes of Arabia will not whiten this little hand."<br/>
</div>
<p>She looked up and the sparkle of the tear in her eye was like ice.</p>
<p>"You're not very sympathetic."</p>
<p>Amory mistook her meaning.</p>
<p>"Isabelle, darling, I think it'll&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Don't touch me!" she cried. "Haven't I enough on my mind and you stand there and <i>laugh!</i>"</p>
<p>Then he slipped again.</p>
<p>"Well, it <i>is</i> funny, Isabelle, and we were talking the other day about a sense of humor being&#8212;"</p>
<p>She was looking at him with something that was not a smile, rather the faint, mirthless echo of a smile, in the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Oh, shut up!" she cried suddenly, and fled down the hallway toward her room. Amory stood there, covered with remorseful confusion.</p>
<p>"Damn!"</p>
<p>When Isabelle reappeared she had thrown a light wrap about her shoulders, and they descended the stairs in a silence that endured through dinner.</p>
<p>"Isabelle," he began rather testily, as they arranged themselves in the car, bound for a dance at the Greenwich Country Club, "you're angry, and I'll be, too, in a minute. Let's kiss and make up."</p>
<p>Isabelle considered glumly.</p>
<p>"I hate to be laughed at," she said finally.</p>
<p>"I won't laugh any more. I'm not laughing now, am I?"</p>
<p>"You did."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't be so darned feminine."</p>
<p>Her lips curled slightly.</p>
<p>"I'll be anything I want."</p>
<p>Amory kept his temper with difficulty. He became aware that he had not an ounce of real affection for Isabelle, but her coldness piqued him. He wanted to kiss her, kiss her a lot, because then he knew he could leave in the morning and not care. On the contrary, if he didn't kiss her, it would worry him.... It would interfere vaguely with his idea of himself as a conqueror. It wasn't dignified to come off second best, <i>pleading</i>, with a doughty warrior like Isabelle.</p>
<p>Perhaps she suspected this. At any rate, Amory watched the night that should have been the consummation of romance glide by with great moths overhead and the heavy fragrance of roadside gardens, but without those broken words, those little sighs....</p>
<p>Afterward they suppered on ginger ale and devil's food in the pantry, and Amory announced a decision.</p>
<p>"I'm leaving early in the morning."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Why not?" he countered.</p>
<p>"There's no need."</p>
<p>"However, I'm going."</p>
<p>"Well, if you insist on being ridiculous&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't put it that way," he objected.</p>
<p>"&#8212;just because I won't let you kiss me. Do you think&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Now, Isabelle," he interrupted, "you know it's not that&#8212;even suppose it is. We've reached the stage where we either ought to kiss&#8212;or&#8212;or&#8212;nothing. It isn't as if you were refusing on moral grounds."</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>"I really don't know what to think about you," she began, in a feeble, perverse attempt at conciliation. "You're so funny."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Well, I thought you had a lot of self-confidence and all that; remember you told me the other day that you could do anything you wanted, or get anything you wanted?"</p>
<p>Amory flushed. He <i>had</i> told her a lot of things.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, you didn't seem to feel so self-confident to-night. Maybe you're just plain conceited."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not," he hesitated. "At Princeton&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Oh, you and Princeton! You'd think that was the world, the way you talk! Perhaps you <i>can</i> write better than anybody else on your old Princetonian; maybe the freshmen <i>do</i> think you're important&#8212;"</p>
<p>"You don't understand&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," she interrupted. "I <i>do</i>, because you're always talking about yourself and I used to like it; now I don't."</p>
<p>"Have I to-night?"</p>
<p>"That's just the point," insisted Isabelle. "You got all upset to-night. You just sat and watched my eyes. Besides, I have to think all the time I'm talking to you&#8212;you're so critical."</p>
<p>"I make you think, do I?" Amory repeated with a touch of vanity.</p>
<p>"You're a nervous strain"&#8212;this emphatically&#8212;"and when you analyze every little emotion and instinct I just don't have 'em."</p>
<p>"I know." Amory admitted her point and shook his head helplessly.</p>
<p>"Let's go." She stood up.</p>
<p>He rose abstractedly and they walked to the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>"What train can I get?"</p>
<p>"There's one about 9:11 if you really must go."</p>
<p>"Yes, I've got to go, really. Good night."</p>
<p>"Good night."</p>
<p>They were at the head of the stairs, and as Amory turned into his room he thought he caught just the faintest cloud of discontent in her face. He lay awake in the darkness and wondered how much he cared&#8212;how much of his sudden unhappiness was hurt vanity&#8212;whether he was, after all, temperamentally unfitted for romance.</p>
<p>When he awoke, it was with a glad flood of consciousness. The early wind stirred the chintz curtains at the windows and he was idly puzzled not to be in his room at Princeton with his school football picture over the bureau and the Triangle Club on the wall opposite. Then the grandfather's clock in the hall outside struck eight, and the memory of the night before came to him. He was out of bed, dressing, like the wind; he must get out of the house before he saw Isabelle. What had seemed a melancholy happening, now seemed a tiresome anticlimax. He was dressed at half past, so he sat down by the window; felt that the sinews of his heart were twisted somewhat more than he had thought. What an ironic mockery the morning seemed!&#8212;bright and sunny, and full of the smell of the garden; hearing Mrs. Borge's voice in the sun-parlor below, he wondered where was Isabelle.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>"The car will be around at ten minutes of nine, sir."</p>
<p>He returned to his contemplation of the outdoors, and began repeating over and over, mechanically, a verse from Browning, which he had once quoted to Isabelle in a letter:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160; "Each life unfulfilled, you see,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It hangs still, patchy and scrappy;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; We have not sighed deep, laughed free,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Starved, feasted, despaired&#8212;been happy."<br/>
</div>
<p>But his life would not be unfulfilled. He took a sombre satisfaction in thinking that perhaps all along she had been nothing except what he had read into her; that this was her high point, that no one else would ever make her think. Yet that was what she had objected to in him; and Amory was suddenly tired of thinking, thinking!</p>
<p>"Damn her!" he said bitterly, "she's spoiled my year!"</p>
<hr/>
<p>THE SUPERMAN GROWS CARELESS</p>
<p>On a dusty day in September Amory arrived in Princeton and joined the sweltering crowd of conditioned men who thronged the streets. It seemed a stupid way to commence his upper-class years, to spend four hours a morning in the stuffy room of a tutoring school, imbibing the infinite boredom of conic sections. Mr. Rooney, pander to the dull, conducted the class and smoked innumerable Pall Malls as he drew diagrams and worked equations from six in the morning until midnight.</p>
<p>"Now, Langueduc, if I used that formula, where would my A point be?"</p>
<p>Langueduc lazily shifts his six-foot-three of football material and tries to concentrate.</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;ah&#8212;I'm damned if I know, Mr. Rooney."</p>
<p>"Oh, why of course, of course you can't <i>use</i> that formula. <i>That's</i> what I wanted you to say."</p>
<p>"Why, sure, of course."</p>
<p>"Do you see why?"</p>
<p>"You bet&#8212;I suppose so."</p>
<p>"If you don't see, tell me. I'm here to show you."</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Rooney, if you don't mind, I wish you'd go over that again."</p>
<p>"Gladly. Now here's 'A'..."</p>
<p>The room was a study in stupidity&#8212;two huge stands for paper, Mr. Rooney in his shirt-sleeves in front of them, and slouched around on chairs, a dozen men: Fred Sloane, the pitcher, who absolutely <i>had</i> to get eligible; "Slim" Langueduc, who would beat Yale this fall, if only he could master a poor fifty per cent; McDowell, gay young sophomore, who thought it was quite a sporting thing to be tutoring here with all these prominent athletes.</p>
<p>"Those poor birds who haven't a cent to tutor, and have to study during the term are the ones I pity," he announced to Amory one day, with a flaccid camaraderie in the droop of the cigarette from his pale lips. "I should think it would be such a bore, there's so much else to do in New York during the term. I suppose they don't know what they miss, anyhow." There was such an air of "you and I" about Mr. McDowell that Amory very nearly pushed him out of the open window when he said this. ... Next February his mother would wonder why he didn't make a club and increase his allowance... simple little nut....</p>
<p>Through the smoke and the air of solemn, dense earnestness that filled the room would come the inevitable helpless cry:</p>
<p>"I don't get it! Repeat that, Mr. Rooney!" Most of them were so stupid or careless that they wouldn't admit when they didn't understand, and Amory was of the latter. He found it impossible to study conic sections; something in their calm and tantalizing respectability breathing defiantly through Mr. Rooney's fetid parlors distorted their equations into insoluble anagrams. He made a last night's effort with the proverbial wet towel, and then blissfully took the exam, wondering unhappily why all the color and ambition of the spring before had faded out. Somehow, with the defection of Isabelle the idea of undergraduate success had loosed its grasp on his imagination, and he contemplated a possible failure to pass off his condition with equanimity, even though it would arbitrarily mean his removal from the Princetonian board and the slaughter of his chances for the Senior Council.</p>
<p>There was always his luck.</p>
<p>He yawned, scribbled his honor pledge on the cover, and sauntered from the room.</p>
<p>"If you don't pass it," said the newly arrived Alec as they sat on the window-seat of Amory's room and mused upon a scheme of wall decoration, "you're the world's worst goopher. Your stock will go down like an elevator at the club and on the campus."</p>
<p>"Oh, hell, I know it. Why rub it in?"</p>
<p>"'Cause you deserve it. Anybody that'd risk what you were in line for <i>ought</i> to be ineligible for Princetonian chairman."</p>
<p>"Oh, drop the subject," Amory protested. "Watch and wait and shut up. I don't want every one at the club asking me about it, as if I were a prize potato being fattened for a vegetable show." One evening a week later Amory stopped below his own window on the way to Renwick's, and, seeing a light, called up:</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, any mail?"</p>
<p>Alec's head appeared against the yellow square of light.</p>
<p>"Yes, your result's here."</p>
<p>His heart clamored violently.</p>
<p>"What is it, blue or pink?"</p>
<p>"Don't know. Better come up."</p>
<p>He walked into the room and straight over to the table, and then suddenly noticed that there were other people in the room.</p>
<p>"'Lo, Kerry." He was most polite. "Ah, men of Princeton." They seemed to be mostly friends, so he picked up the envelope marked "Registrar's Office," and weighed it nervously.</p>
<p>"We have here quite a slip of paper."</p>
<p>"Open it, Amory."</p>
<p>"Just to be dramatic, I'll let you know that if it's blue, my name is withdrawn from the editorial board of the Prince, and my short career is over."</p>
<p>He paused, and then saw for the first time Ferrenby's eyes, wearing a hungry look and watching him eagerly. Amory returned the gaze pointedly.</p>
<p>"Watch my face, gentlemen, for the primitive emotions."</p>
<p>He tore it open and held the slip up to the light.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Pink or blue?"</p>
<p>"Say what it is."</p>
<p>"We're all ears, Amory."</p>
<p>"Smile or swear&#8212;or something."</p>
<p>There was a pause... a small crowd of seconds swept by... then he looked again and another crowd went on into time.</p>
<p>"Blue as the sky, gentlemen...."</p>
<hr/>
<p>AFTERMATH</p>
<p>What Amory did that year from early September to late in the spring was so purposeless and inconsecutive that it seems scarcely worth recording. He was, of course, immediately sorry for what he had lost. His philosophy of success had tumbled down upon him, and he looked for the reasons.</p>
<p>"Your own laziness," said Alec later.</p>
<p>"No&#8212;something deeper than that. I've begun to feel that I was meant to lose this chance."</p>
<p>"They're rather off you at the club, you know; every man that doesn't come through makes our crowd just so much weaker."</p>
<p>"I hate that point of view."</p>
<p>"Of course, with a little effort you could still stage a comeback."</p>
<p>"No&#8212;I'm through&#8212;as far as ever being a power in college is concerned."</p>
<p>"But, Amory, honestly, what makes me the angriest isn't the fact that you won't be chairman of the Prince and on the Senior Council, but just that you didn't get down and pass that exam."</p>
<p>"Not me," said Amory slowly; "I'm mad at the concrete thing. My own idleness was quite in accord with my system, but the luck broke."</p>
<p>"Your system broke, you mean."</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"Well, what are you going to do? Get a better one quick, or just bum around for two more years as a has-been?"</p>
<p>"I don't know yet..."</p>
<p>"Oh, Amory, buck up!"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>Amory's point of view, though dangerous, was not far from the true one. If his reactions to his environment could be tabulated, the chart would have appeared like this, beginning with his earliest years:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"> 1. The fundamental Amory.<br/><br/> 2. Amory plus Beatrice.<br/><br/> 3. Amory plus Beatrice plus Minneapolis.<br/>
</div>
<p>Then St. Regis' had pulled him to pieces and started him over again:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"> 4. Amory plus St. Regis'.<br/><br/> 5. Amory plus St. Regis' plus Princeton.<br/>
</div>
<p>That had been his nearest approach to success through conformity. The fundamental Amory, idle, imaginative, rebellious, had been nearly snowed under. He had conformed, he had succeeded, but as his imagination was neither satisfied nor grasped by his own success, he had listlessly, half-accidentally chucked the whole thing and become again:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"> 6. The fundamental Amory.<br/><br/>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>FINANCIAL</p>
<p>His father died quietly and inconspicuously at Thanksgiving. The incongruity of death with either the beauties of Lake Geneva or with his mother's dignified, reticent attitude diverted him, and he looked at the funeral with an amused tolerance. He decided that burial was after all preferable to cremation, and he smiled at his old boyhood choice, slow oxidation in the top of a tree. The day after the ceremony he was amusing himself in the great library by sinking back on a couch in graceful mortuary attitudes, trying to determine whether he would, when his day came, be found with his arms crossed piously over his chest (Monsignor Darcy had once advocated this posture as being the most distinguished), or with his hands clasped behind his head, a more pagan and Byronic attitude.</p>
<p>What interested him much more than the final departure of his father from things mundane was a tri-cornered conversation between Beatrice, Mr. Barton, of Barton and Krogman, their lawyers, and himself, that took place several days after the funeral. For the first time he came into actual cognizance of the family finances, and realized what a tidy fortune had once been under his father's management. He took a ledger labelled "1906" and ran through it rather carefully. The total expenditure that year had come to something over one hundred and ten thousand dollars. Forty thousand of this had been Beatrice's own income, and there had been no attempt to account for it: it was all under the heading, "Drafts, checks, and letters of credit forwarded to Beatrice Blaine." The dispersal of the rest was rather minutely itemized: the taxes and improvements on the Lake Geneva estate had come to almost nine thousand dollars; the general up-keep, including Beatrice's electric and a French car, bought that year, was over thirty-five thousand dollars. The rest was fully taken care of, and there were invariably items which failed to balance on the right side of the ledger.</p>
<p>In the volume for 1912 Amory was shocked to discover the decrease in the number of bond holdings and the great drop in the income. In the case of Beatrice's money this was not so pronounced, but it was obvious that his father had devoted the previous year to several unfortunate gambles in oil. Very little of the oil had been burned, but Stephen Blaine had been rather badly singed. The next year and the next and the next showed similar decreases, and Beatrice had for the first time begun using her own money for keeping up the house. Yet her doctor's bill for 1913 had been over nine thousand dollars.</p>
<p>About the exact state of things Mr. Barton was quite vague and confused. There had been recent investments, the outcome of which was for the present problematical, and he had an idea there were further speculations and exchanges concerning which he had not been consulted.</p>
<p>It was not for several months that Beatrice wrote Amory the full situation. The entire residue of the Blaine and O'Hara fortunes consisted of the place at Lake Geneva and approximately a half million dollars, invested now in fairly conservative six-per-cent holdings. In fact, Beatrice wrote that she was putting the money into railroad and street-car bonds as fast as she could conveniently transfer it.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160; "I am quite sure," she wrote to Amory, "that if there is one<br/>&#160; thing we can be positive of, it is that people will not stay in<br/>&#160; one place.&#160; This Ford person has certainly made the most of that<br/>&#160; idea.&#160; So I am instructing Mr. Barton to specialize on such things<br/>&#160; as Northern Pacific and these Rapid Transit Companies, as they<br/>&#160; call the street-cars.&#160; I shall never forgive myself for not buying<br/>&#160; Bethlehem Steel.&#160; I've heard the most fascinating stories.&#160; You<br/>&#160; must go into finance, Amory.&#160; I'm sure you would revel in it.<br/>&#160; You start as a messenger or a teller, I believe, and from that you<br/>&#160; go up&#8212;almost indefinitely.&#160; I'm sure if I were a man I'd love the<br/>&#160; handling of money; it has become quite a senile passion with me.<br/>&#160; Before I get any farther I want to discuss something.&#160; A Mrs. Bispam,<br/>&#160; an overcordial little lady whom I met at a tea the other day,<br/>&#160; told me that her son, he is at Yale, wrote her that all the<br/>&#160; boys there wore their summer underwear all during the winter,<br/>&#160; and also went about with their heads wet and in low shoes on the<br/>&#160; coldest days.&#160; Now, Amory, I don't know whether that is a fad at<br/>&#160; Princeton too, but I don't want you to be so foolish.&#160; It not only<br/>&#160; inclines a young man to pneumonia and infantile paralysis, but to<br/>&#160; all forms of lung trouble, to which you are particularly<br/>&#160; inclined.&#160; You cannot experiment with your health.&#160; I have found<br/>&#160; that out.&#160; I will not make myself ridiculous as some mothers no<br/>&#160; doubt do, by insisting that you wear overshoes, though I remember<br/>&#160; one Christmas you wore them around constantly without a single<br/>&#160; buckle latched, making such a curious swishing sound, and you<br/>&#160; refused to buckle them because it was not the thing to do.&#160; The<br/>&#160; very next Christmas you would not wear even rubbers, though I<br/>&#160; begged you.&#160; You are nearly twenty years old now, dear, and I<br/>&#160; can't be with you constantly to find whether you are doing the<br/>&#160; sensible thing.<br/><br/>&#160; "This has been a very <i>practical</i> letter.&#160; I warned you in my last<br/>&#160; that the lack of money to do the things one wants to makes one<br/>&#160; quite prosy and domestic, but there is still plenty for<br/>&#160; everything if we are not too extravagant.&#160; Take care of yourself,<br/>&#160; my dear boy, and do try to write at least <i>once</i> a week, because I<br/>&#160; imagine all sorts of horrible things if I don't hear from you.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Affectionately,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; MOTHER."<br/><br/>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE TERM "PERSONAGE"</p>
<p>Monsignor Darcy invited Amory up to the Stuart palace on the Hudson for a week at Christmas, and they had enormous conversations around the open fire. Monsignor was growing a trifle stouter and his personality had expanded even with that, and Amory felt both rest and security in sinking into a squat, cushioned chair and joining him in the middle-aged sanity of a cigar.</p>
<p>"I've felt like leaving college, Monsignor."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"All my career's gone up in smoke; you think it's petty and all that, but&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Not at all petty. I think it's most important. I want to hear the whole thing. Everything you've been doing since I saw you last."</p>
<p>Amory talked; he went thoroughly into the destruction of his egotistic highways, and in a half-hour the listless quality had left his voice.</p>
<p>"What would you do if you left college?" asked Monsignor.</p>
<p>"Don't know. I'd like to travel, but of course this tiresome war prevents that. Anyways, mother would hate not having me graduate. I'm just at sea. Kerry Holiday wants me to go over with him and join the Lafayette Esquadrille."</p>
<p>"You know you wouldn't like to go."</p>
<p>"Sometimes I would&#8212;to-night I'd go in a second."</p>
<p>"Well, you'd have to be very much more tired of life than I think you are. I know you."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you do," agreed Amory reluctantly. "It just seemed an easy way out of everything&#8212;when I think of another useless, draggy year."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know; but to tell you the truth, I'm not worried about you; you seem to me to be progressing perfectly naturally."</p>
<p>"No," Amory objected. "I've lost half my personality in a year."</p>
<p>"Not a bit of it!" scoffed Monsignor. "You've lost a great amount of vanity and that's all."</p>
<p>"Lordy! I feel, anyway, as if I'd gone through another fifth form at St. Regis's."</p>
<p>"No." Monsignor shook his head. "That was a misfortune; this has been a good thing. Whatever worth while comes to you, won't be through the channels you were searching last year."</p>
<p>"What could be more unprofitable than my present lack of pep?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps in itself... but you're developing. This has given you time to think and you're casting off a lot of your old luggage about success and the superman and all. People like us can't adopt whole theories, as you did. If we can do the next thing, and have an hour a day to think in, we can accomplish marvels, but as far as any high-handed scheme of blind dominance is concerned&#8212;we'd just make asses of ourselves."</p>
<p>"But, Monsignor, I can't do the next thing."</p>
<p>"Amory, between you and me, I have only just learned to do it myself. I can do the one hundred things beyond the next thing, but I stub my toe on that, just as you stubbed your toe on mathematics this fall."</p>
<p>"Why do we have to do the next thing? It never seems the sort of thing I should do."</p>
<p>"We have to do it because we're not personalities, but personages."</p>
<p>"That's a good line&#8212;what do you mean?"</p>
<p>"A personality is what you thought you were, what this Kerry and Sloane you tell me of evidently are. Personality is a physical matter almost entirely; it lowers the people it acts on&#8212;I've seen it vanish in a long sickness. But while a personality is active, it overrides 'the next thing.' Now a personage, on the other hand, gathers. He is never thought of apart from what he's done. He's a bar on which a thousand things have been hung&#8212;glittering things sometimes, as ours are; but he uses those things with a cold mentality back of them."</p>
<p>"And several of my most glittering possessions had fallen off when I needed them." Amory continued the simile eagerly.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it; when you feel that your garnered prestige and talents and all that are hung out, you need never bother about anybody; you can cope with them without difficulty."</p>
<p>"But, on the other hand, if I haven't my possessions, I'm helpless!"</p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p>"That's certainly an idea."</p>
<p>"Now you've a clean start&#8212;a start Kerry or Sloane can constitutionally never have. You brushed three or four ornaments down, and, in a fit of pique, knocked off the rest of them. The thing now is to collect some new ones, and the farther you look ahead in the collecting the better. But remember, do the next thing!"</p>
<p>"How clear you can make things!"</p>
<p>So they talked, often about themselves, sometimes of philosophy and religion, and life as respectively a game or a mystery. The priest seemed to guess Amory's thoughts before they were clear in his own head, so closely related were their minds in form and groove.</p>
<p>"Why do I make lists?" Amory asked him one night. "Lists of all sorts of things?"</p>
<p>"Because you're a mediaevalist," Monsignor answered. "We both are. It's the passion for classifying and finding a type."</p>
<p>"It's a desire to get something definite."</p>
<p>"It's the nucleus of scholastic philosophy."</p>
<p>"I was beginning to think I was growing eccentric till I came up here. It was a pose, I guess."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that; for you not posing may be the biggest pose of all. Pose&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"But do the next thing."</p>
<p>After Amory returned to college he received several letters from Monsignor which gave him more egotistic food for consumption.</p>
