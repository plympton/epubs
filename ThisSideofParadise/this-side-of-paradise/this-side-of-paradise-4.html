</div>
<p>Even Amory's reading paled during this period; he delved further into the misty side streets of literature: Huysmans, Walter Pater, Theophile Gautier, and the racier sections of Rabelais, Boccaccio, Petronius, and Suetonius. One week, through general curiosity, he inspected the private libraries of his classmates and found Sloane's as typical as any: sets of Kipling, O. Henry, John Fox, Jr., and Richard Harding Davis; "What Every Middle-Aged Woman Ought to Know," "The Spell of the Yukon"; a "gift" copy of James Whitcomb Riley, an assortment of battered, annotated schoolbooks, and, finally, to his surprise, one of his own late discoveries, the collected poems of Rupert Brooke.</p>
<p>Together with Tom D'Invilliers, he sought among the lights of Princeton for some one who might found the Great American Poetic Tradition.</p>
<p>The undergraduate body itself was rather more interesting that year than had been the entirely Philistine Princeton of two years before. Things had livened surprisingly, though at the sacrifice of much of the spontaneous charm of freshman year. In the old Princeton they would never have discovered Tanaduke Wylie. Tanaduke was a sophomore, with tremendous ears and a way of saying, "The earth swirls down through the ominous moons of preconsidered generations!" that made them vaguely wonder why it did not sound quite clear, but never question that it was the utterance of a supersoul. At least so Tom and Amory took him. They told him in all earnestness that he had a mind like Shelley's, and featured his ultrafree free verse and prose poetry in the Nassau Literary Magazine. But Tanaduke's genius absorbed the many colors of the age, and he took to the Bohemian life, to their great disappointment. He talked of Greenwich Village now instead of "noon-swirled moons," and met winter muses, unacademic, and cloistered by Forty-second Street and Broadway, instead of the Shelleyan dream-children with whom he had regaled their expectant appreciation. So they surrendered Tanaduke to the futurists, deciding that he and his flaming ties would do better there. Tom gave him the final advice that he should stop writing for two years and read the complete works of Alexander Pope four times, but on Amory's suggestion that Pope for Tanaduke was like foot-ease for stomach trouble, they withdrew in laughter, and called it a coin's toss whether this genius was too big or too petty for them.</p>
<p>Amory rather scornfully avoided the popular professors who dispensed easy epigrams and thimblefuls of Chartreuse to groups of admirers every night. He was disappointed, too, at the air of general uncertainty on every subject that seemed linked with the pedantic temperament; his opinions took shape in a miniature satire called "In a Lecture-Room," which he persuaded Tom to print in the Nassau Lit.</p>

<p>In April, Kerry Holiday left college and sailed for France to enroll in the Lafayette Esquadrille. Amory's envy and admiration of this step was drowned in an experience of his own to which he never succeeded in giving an appropriate value, but which, nevertheless, haunted him for three years afterward.</p>
<hr/>
<p>THE DEVIL</p>
<p>Healy's they left at twelve and taxied to Bistolary's. There were Axia Marlowe and Phoebe Column, from the Summer Garden show, Fred Sloane and Amory. The evening was so very young that they felt ridiculous with surplus energy, and burst into the cafe like Dionysian revellers.</p>
<p>"Table for four in the middle of the floor," yelled Phoebe. "Hurry, old dear, tell 'em we're here!"</p>
<p>"Tell 'em to play 'Admiration'!" shouted Sloane. "You two order; Phoebe and I are going to shake a wicked calf," and they sailed off in the muddled crowd. Axia and Amory, acquaintances of an hour, jostled behind a waiter to a table at a point of vantage; there they took seats and watched.</p>
<p>"There's Findle Margotson, from New Haven!" she cried above the uproar. "'Lo, Findle! Whoo-ee!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Axia!" he shouted in salutation. "C'mon over to our table." "No!" Amory whispered.</p>
<p>"Can't do it, Findle; I'm with somebody else! Call me up to-morrow about one o'clock!"</p>
<p>Findle, a nondescript man-about-Bisty's, answered incoherently and turned back to the brilliant blonde whom he was endeavoring to steer around the room.</p>
<p>"There's a natural damn fool," commented Amory.</p>
<p>"Oh, he's all right. Here's the old jitney waiter. If you ask me, I want a double Daiquiri."</p>
<p>"Make it four."</p>
<p>The crowd whirled and changed and shifted. They were mostly from the colleges, with a scattering of the male refuse of Broadway, and women of two types, the higher of which was the chorus girl. On the whole it was a typical crowd, and their party as typical as any. About three-fourths of the whole business was for effect and therefore harmless, ended at the door of the cafe, soon enough for the five-o'clock train back to Yale or Princeton; about one-fourth continued on into the dimmer hours and gathered strange dust from strange places. Their party was scheduled to be one of the harmless kind. Fred Sloane and Phoebe Column were old friends; Axia and Amory new ones. But strange things are prepared even in the dead of night, and the unusual, which lurks least in the cafe, home of the prosaic and inevitable, was preparing to spoil for him the waning romance of Broadway. The way it took was so inexpressibly terrible, so unbelievable, that afterward he never thought of it as experience; but it was a scene from a misty tragedy, played far behind the veil, and that it meant something definite he knew.</p>
<p>About one o'clock they moved to Maxim's, and two found them in Deviniere's. Sloane had been drinking consecutively and was in a state of unsteady exhilaration, but Amory was quite tiresomely sober; they had run across none of those ancient, corrupt buyers of champagne who usually assisted their New York parties. They were just through dancing and were making their way back to their chairs when Amory became aware that some one at a near-by table was looking at him. He turned and glanced casually... a middle-aged man dressed in a brown sack suit, it was, sitting a little apart at a table by himself and watching their party intently. At Amory's glance he smiled faintly. Amory turned to Fred, who was just sitting down.</p>
<p>"Who's that pale fool watching us?" he complained indignantly.</p>
<p>"Where?" cried Sloane. "We'll have him thrown out!" He rose to his feet and swayed back and forth, clinging to his chair. "Where is he?"</p>
<p>Axia and Phoebe suddenly leaned and whispered to each other across the table, and before Amory realized it they found themselves on their way to the door.</p>
<p>"Where now?"</p>
<p>"Up to the flat," suggested Phoebe. "We've got brandy and fizz&#8212;and everything's slow down here to-night."</p>
<p>Amory considered quickly. He hadn't been drinking, and decided that if he took no more, it would be reasonably discreet for him to trot along in the party. In fact, it would be, perhaps, the thing to do in order to keep an eye on Sloane, who was not in a state to do his own thinking. So he took Axia's arm and, piling intimately into a taxicab, they drove out over the hundreds and drew up at a tall, white-stone apartment-house. ... Never would he forget that street.... It was a broad street, lined on both sides with just such tall, white-stone buildings, dotted with dark windows; they stretched along as far as the eye could see, flooded with a bright moonlight that gave them a calcium pallor. He imagined each one to have an elevator and a colored hall-boy and a key-rack; each one to be eight stories high and full of three and four room suites. He was rather glad to walk into the cheeriness of Phoebe's living-room and sink onto a sofa, while the girls went rummaging for food.</p>
<p>"Phoebe's great stuff," confided Sloane, sotto voce.</p>
<p>"I'm only going to stay half an hour," Amory said sternly. He wondered if it sounded priggish.</p>
<p>"Hell y' say," protested Sloane. "We're here now&#8212;don't le's rush."</p>
<p>"I don't like this place," Amory said sulkily, "and I don't want any food."</p>
<p>Phoebe reappeared with sandwiches, brandy bottle, siphon, and four glasses.</p>
<p>"Amory, pour 'em out," she said, "and we'll drink to Fred Sloane, who has a rare, distinguished edge."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Axia, coming in, "and Amory. I like Amory." She sat down beside him and laid her yellow head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"I'll pour," said Sloane; "you use siphon, Phoebe."</p>
<p>They filled the tray with glasses.</p>
<p>"Ready, here she goes!"</p>
<p>Amory hesitated, glass in hand.</p>
<p>There was a minute while temptation crept over him like a warm wind, and his imagination turned to fire, and he took the glass from Phoebe's hand. That was all; for at the second that his decision came, he looked up and saw, ten yards from him, the man who had been in the cafe, and with his jump of astonishment the glass fell from his uplifted hand. There the man half sat, half leaned against a pile of pillows on the corner divan. His face was cast in the same yellow wax as in the cafe, neither the dull, pasty color of a dead man&#8212;rather a sort of virile pallor&#8212;nor unhealthy, you'd have called it; but like a strong man who'd worked in a mine or done night shifts in a damp climate. Amory looked him over carefully and later he could have drawn him after a fashion, down to the merest details. His mouth was the kind that is called frank, and he had steady gray eyes that moved slowly from one to the other of their group, with just the shade of a questioning expression. Amory noticed his hands; they weren't fine at all, but they had versatility and a tenuous strength... they were nervous hands that sat lightly along the cushions and moved constantly with little jerky openings and closings. Then, suddenly, Amory perceived the feet, and with a rush of blood to the head he realized he was afraid. The feet were all wrong ... with a sort of wrongness that he felt rather than knew.... It was like weakness in a good woman, or blood on satin; one of those terrible incongruities that shake little things in the back of the brain. He wore no shoes, but, instead, a sort of half moccasin, pointed, though, like the shoes they wore in the fourteenth century, and with the little ends curling up. They were a darkish brown and his toes seemed to fill them to the end.... They were unutterably terrible....</p>
<p>He must have said something, or looked something, for Axia's voice came out of the void with a strange goodness.</p>
<p>"Well, look at Amory! Poor old Amory's sick&#8212;old head going 'round?"</p>
<p>"Look at that man!" cried Amory, pointing toward the corner divan.</p>
<p>"You mean that purple zebra!" shrieked Axia facetiously. "Ooo-ee! Amory's got a purple zebra watching him!"</p>
<p>Sloane laughed vacantly.</p>
<p>"Ole zebra gotcha, Amory?"</p>
<p>There was a silence.... The man regarded Amory quizzically.... Then the human voices fell faintly on his ear:</p>
<p>"Thought you weren't drinking," remarked Axia sardonically, but her voice was good to hear; the whole divan that held the man was alive; alive like heat waves over asphalt, like wriggling worms....</p>
<p>"Come back! Come back!" Axia's arm fell on his. "Amory, dear, you aren't going, Amory!" He was half-way to the door.</p>
<p>"Come on, Amory, stick 'th us!"</p>
<p>"Sick, are you?"</p>
<p>"Sit down a second!"</p>
<p>"Take some water."</p>
<p>"Take a little brandy...."</p>
<p>The elevator was close, and the colored boy was half asleep, paled to a livid bronze... Axia's beseeching voice floated down the shaft. Those feet... those feet...</p>
<p>As they settled to the lower floor the feet came into view in the sickly electric light of the paved hall.</p>
<hr/>
<p>IN THE ALLEY</p>
<p>Down the long street came the moon, and Amory turned his back on it and walked. Ten, fifteen steps away sounded the footsteps. They were like a slow dripping, with just the slightest insistence in their fall. Amory's shadow lay, perhaps, ten feet ahead of him, and soft shoes was presumably that far behind. With the instinct of a child Amory edged in under the blue darkness of the white buildings, cleaving the moonlight for haggard seconds, once bursting into a slow run with clumsy stumblings. After that he stopped suddenly; he must keep hold, he thought. His lips were dry and he licked them.</p>
<p>If he met any one good&#8212;were there any good people left in the world or did they all live in white apartment-houses now? Was every one followed in the moonlight? But if he met some one good who'd know what he meant and hear this damned scuffle... then the scuffling grew suddenly nearer, and a black cloud settled over the moon. When again the pale sheen skimmed the cornices, it was almost beside him, and Amory thought he heard a quiet breathing. Suddenly he realized that the footsteps were not behind, had never been behind, they were ahead and he was not eluding but following... following. He began to run, blindly, his heart knocking heavily, his hands clinched. Far ahead a black dot showed itself, resolved slowly into a human shape. But Amory was beyond that now; he turned off the street and darted into an alley, narrow and dark and smelling of old rottenness. He twisted down a long, sinuous blackness, where the moonlight was shut away except for tiny glints and patches... then suddenly sank panting into a corner by a fence, exhausted. The steps ahead stopped, and he could hear them shift slightly with a continuous motion, like waves around a dock.</p>
<p>He put his face in his hands and covered eyes and ears as well as he could. During all this time it never occurred to him that he was delirious or drunk. He had a sense of reality such as material things could never give him. His intellectual content seemed to submit passively to it, and it fitted like a glove everything that had ever preceded it in his life. It did not muddle him. It was like a problem whose answer he knew on paper, yet whose solution he was unable to grasp. He was far beyond horror. He had sunk through the thin surface of that, now moved in a region where the feet and the fear of white walls were real, living things, things he must accept. Only far inside his soul a little fire leaped and cried that something was pulling him down, trying to get him inside a door and slam it behind him. After that door was slammed there would be only footfalls and white buildings in the moonlight, and perhaps he would be one of the footfalls.</p>
<p>During the five or ten minutes he waited in the shadow of the fence, there was somehow this fire... that was as near as he could name it afterward. He remembered calling aloud:</p>
<p>"I want some one stupid. Oh, send some one stupid!" This to the black fence opposite him, in whose shadows the footsteps shuffled ... shuffled. He supposed "stupid" and "good" had become somehow intermingled through previous association. When he called thus it was not an act of will at all&#8212;will had turned him away from the moving figure in the street; it was almost instinct that called, just the pile on pile of inherent tradition or some wild prayer from way over the night. Then something clanged like a low gong struck at a distance, and before his eyes a face flashed over the two feet, a face pale and distorted with a sort of infinite evil that twisted it like flame in the wind; <i>but he knew, for the half instant that the gong tanged and hummed, that it was the face of Dick Humbird.</i></p>
<p>Minutes later he sprang to his feet, realizing dimly that there was no more sound, and that he was alone in the graying alley. It was cold, and he started on a steady run for the light that showed the street at the other end.</p>
<hr/>
<p>AT THE WINDOW</p>
<p>It was late morning when he woke and found the telephone beside his bed in the hotel tolling frantically, and remembered that he had left word to be called at eleven. Sloane was snoring heavily, his clothes in a pile by his bed. They dressed and ate breakfast in silence, and then sauntered out to get some air. Amory's mind was working slowly, trying to assimilate what had happened and separate from the chaotic imagery that stacked his memory the bare shreds of truth. If the morning had been cold and gray he could have grasped the reins of the past in an instant, but it was one of those days that New York gets sometimes in May, when the air on Fifth Avenue is a soft, light wine. How much or how little Sloane remembered Amory did not care to know; he apparently had none of the nervous tension that was gripping Amory and forcing his mind back and forth like a shrieking saw.</p>
<p>Then Broadway broke upon them, and with the babel of noise and the painted faces a sudden sickness rushed over Amory.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, let's go back! Let's get off of this&#8212;this place!"</p>
<p>Sloane looked at him in amazement.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"This street, it's ghastly! Come on! let's get back to the Avenue!"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say," said Sloane stolidly, "that 'cause you had some sort of indigestion that made you act like a maniac last night, you're never coming on Broadway again?"</p>
<p>Simultaneously Amory classed him with the crowd, and he seemed no longer Sloane of the debonair humor and the happy personality, but only one of the evil faces that whirled along the turbid stream.</p>
<p>"Man!" he shouted so loud that the people on the corner turned and followed them with their eyes, "it's filthy, and if you can't see it, you're filthy, too!"</p>
<p>"I can't help it," said Sloane doggedly. "What's the matter with you? Old remorse getting you? You'd be in a fine state if you'd gone through with our little party."</p>
<p>"I'm going, Fred," said Amory slowly. His knees were shaking under him, and he knew that if he stayed another minute on this street he would keel over where he stood. "I'll be at the Vanderbilt for lunch." And he strode rapidly off and turned over to Fifth Avenue. Back at the hotel he felt better, but as he walked into the barber-shop, intending to get a head massage, the smell of the powders and tonics brought back Axia's sidelong, suggestive smile, and he left hurriedly. In the doorway of his room a sudden blackness flowed around him like a divided river.</p>
<p>When he came to himself he knew that several hours had passed. He pitched onto the bed and rolled over on his face with a deadly fear that he was going mad. He wanted people, people, some one sane and stupid and good. He lay for he knew not how long without moving. He could feel the little hot veins on his forehead standing out, and his terror had hardened on him like plaster. He felt he was passing up again through the thin crust of horror, and now only could he distinguish the shadowy twilight he was leaving. He must have fallen asleep again, for when he next recollected himself he had paid the hotel bill and was stepping into a taxi at the door. It was raining torrents.</p>
<p>On the train for Princeton he saw no one he knew, only a crowd of fagged-looking Philadelphians. The presence of a painted woman across the aisle filled him with a fresh burst of sickness and he changed to another car, tried to concentrate on an article in a popular magazine. He found himself reading the same paragraphs over and over, so he abandoned this attempt and leaning over wearily pressed his hot forehead against the damp window-pane. The car, a smoker, was hot and stuffy with most of the smells of the state's alien population; he opened a window and shivered against the cloud of fog that drifted in over him. The two hours' ride were like days, and he nearly cried aloud with joy when the towers of Princeton loomed up beside him and the yellow squares of light filtered through the blue rain.</p>
<p>Tom was standing in the centre of the room, pensively relighting a cigar-stub. Amory fancied he looked rather relieved on seeing him.</p>
<p>"Had a hell of a dream about you last night," came in the cracked voice through the cigar smoke. "I had an idea you were in some trouble."</p>
<p>"Don't tell me about it!" Amory almost shrieked. "Don't say a word; I'm tired and pepped out."</p>
<p>Tom looked at him queerly and then sank into a chair and opened his Italian note-book. Amory threw his coat and hat on the floor, loosened his collar, and took a Wells novel at random from the shelf. "Wells is sane," he thought, "and if he won't do I'll read Rupert Brooke."</p>
<p>Half an hour passed. Outside the wind came up, and Amory started as the wet branches moved and clawed with their finger-nails at the window-pane. Tom was deep in his work, and inside the room only the occasional scratch of a match or the rustle of leather as they shifted in their chairs broke the stillness. Then like a zigzag of lightning came the change. Amory sat bolt upright, frozen cold in his chair. Tom was looking at him with his mouth drooping, eyes fixed.</p>
<p>"God help us!" Amory cried.</p>
<p>"Oh, my heavens!" shouted Tom, "look behind!" Quick as a flash Amory whirled around. He saw nothing but the dark window-pane. "It's gone now," came Tom's voice after a second in a still terror. "Something was looking at you."</p>
<p>Trembling violently, Amory dropped into his chair again.</p>
<p>"I've got to tell you," he said. "I've had one hell of an experience. I think I've&#8212;I've seen the devil or&#8212;something like him. What face did you just see?&#8212;or no," he added quickly, "don't tell me!"</p>
<p>And he gave Tom the story. It was midnight when he finished, and after that, with all lights burning, two sleepy, shivering boys read to each other from "The New Machiavelli," until dawn came up out of Witherspoon Hall, and the Princetonian fell against the door, and the May birds hailed the sun on last night's rain.</p>

<h2 id="dlepubid00005">CHAPTER 4. Narcissus Off Duty</h2>
<p>During Princeton's transition period, that is, during Amory's last two years there, while he saw it change and broaden and live up to its Gothic beauty by better means than night parades, certain individuals arrived who stirred it to its plethoric depths. Some of them had been freshmen, and wild freshmen, with Amory; some were in the class below; and it was in the beginning of his last year and around small tables at the Nassau Inn that they began questioning aloud the institutions that Amory and countless others before him had questioned so long in secret. First, and partly by accident, they struck on certain books, a definite type of biographical novel that Amory christened "quest" books. In the "quest" book the hero set off in life armed with the best weapons and avowedly intending to use them as such weapons are usually used, to push their possessors ahead as selfishly and blindly as possible, but the heroes of the "quest" books discovered that there might be a more magnificent use for them. "None Other Gods," "Sinister Street," and "The Research Magnificent" were examples of such books; it was the latter of these three that gripped Burne Holiday and made him wonder in the beginning of senior year how much it was worth while being a diplomatic autocrat around his club on Prospect Avenue and basking in the high lights of class office. It was distinctly through the channels of aristocracy that Burne found his way. Amory, through Kerry, had had a vague drifting acquaintance with him, but not until January of senior year did their friendship commence.</p>
<p>"Heard the latest?" said Tom, coming in late one drizzly evening with that triumphant air he always wore after a successful conversational bout.</p>
<p>"No. Somebody flunked out? Or another ship sunk?"</p>
<p>"Worse than that. About one-third of the junior class are going to resign from their clubs."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"Actual fact!"</p>
<p>"Why!"</p>
<p>"Spirit of reform and all that. Burne Holiday is behind it. The club presidents are holding a meeting to-night to see if they can find a joint means of combating it."</p>
<p>"Well, what's the idea of the thing?"</p>
<p>"Oh, clubs injurious to Princeton democracy; cost a lot; draw social lines, take time; the regular line you get sometimes from disappointed sophomores. Woodrow thought they should be abolished and all that."</p>
<p>"But this is the real thing?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. I think it'll go through."</p>
<p>"For Pete's sake, tell me more about it."</p>
<p>"Well," began Tom, "it seems that the idea developed simultaneously in several heads. I was talking to Burne awhile ago, and he claims that it's a logical result if an intelligent person thinks long enough about the social system. They had a 'discussion crowd' and the point of abolishing the clubs was brought up by some one&#8212;everybody there leaped at it&#8212;it had been in each one's mind, more or less, and it just needed a spark to bring it out."</p>
<p>"Fine! I swear I think it'll be most entertaining. How do they feel up at Cap and Gown?"</p>
<p>"Wild, of course. Every one's been sitting and arguing and swearing and getting mad and getting sentimental and getting brutal. It's the same at all the clubs; I've been the rounds. They get one of the radicals in the corner and fire questions at him."</p>
<p>"How do the radicals stand up?"</p>
<p>"Oh, moderately well. Burne's a damn good talker, and so obviously sincere that you can't get anywhere with him. It's so evident that resigning from his club means so much more to him than preventing it does to us that I felt futile when I argued; finally took a position that was brilliantly neutral. In fact, I believe Burne thought for a while that he'd converted me."</p>
<p>"And you say almost a third of the junior class are going to resign?"</p>
<p>"Call it a fourth and be safe."</p>
<p>"Lord&#8212;who'd have thought it possible!"</p>
<p>There was a brisk knock at the door, and Burne himself came in. "Hello, Amory&#8212;hello, Tom."</p>
<p>Amory rose.</p>
<p>"'Evening, Burne. Don't mind if I seem to rush; I'm going to Renwick's."</p>
<p>Burne turned to him quickly.</p>
<p>"You probably know what I want to talk to Tom about, and it isn't a bit private. I wish you'd stay."</p>
<p>"I'd be glad to." Amory sat down again, and as Burne perched on a table and launched into argument with Tom, he looked at this revolutionary more carefully than he ever had before. Broad-browed and strong-chinned, with a fineness in the honest gray eyes that were like Kerry's, Burne was a man who gave an immediate impression of bigness and security&#8212;stubborn, that was evident, but his stubbornness wore no stolidity, and when he had talked for five minutes Amory knew that this keen enthusiasm had in it no quality of dilettantism.</p>
<p>The intense power Amory felt later in Burne Holiday differed from the admiration he had had for Humbird. This time it began as purely a mental interest. With other men of whom he had thought as primarily first-class, he had been attracted first by their personalities, and in Burne he missed that immediate magnetism to which he usually swore allegiance. But that night Amory was struck by Burne's intense earnestness, a quality he was accustomed to associate only with the dread stupidity, and by the great enthusiasm that struck dead chords in his heart. Burne stood vaguely for a land Amory hoped he was drifting toward&#8212;and it was almost time that land was in sight. Tom and Amory and Alec had reached an impasse; never did they seem to have new experiences in common, for Tom and Alec had been as blindly busy with their committees and boards as Amory had been blindly idling, and the things they had for dissection&#8212;college, contemporary personality and the like&#8212;they had hashed and rehashed for many a frugal conversational meal.</p>
<p>That night they discussed the clubs until twelve, and, in the main, they agreed with Burne. To the roommates it did not seem such a vital subject as it had in the two years before, but the logic of Burne's objections to the social system dovetailed so completely with everything they had thought, that they questioned rather than argued, and envied the sanity that enabled this man to stand out so against all traditions.</p>
<p>Then Amory branched off and found that Burne was deep in other things as well. Economics had interested him and he was turning socialist. Pacifism played in the back of his mind, and he read The Masses and Lyoff Tolstoi faithfully.</p>
<p>"How about religion?" Amory asked him.</p>
<p>"Don't know. I'm in a muddle about a lot of things&#8212;I've just discovered that I've a mind, and I'm starting to read."</p>
<p>"Read what?"</p>
<p>"Everything. I have to pick and choose, of course, but mostly things to make me think. I'm reading the four gospels now, and the 'Varieties of Religious Experience.'"</p>
<p>"What chiefly started you?"</p>
<p>"Wells, I guess, and Tolstoi, and a man named Edward Carpenter. I've been reading for over a year now&#8212;on a few lines, on what I consider the essential lines."</p>
<p>"Poetry?"</p>
<p>"Well, frankly, not what you call poetry, or for your reasons&#8212;you two write, of course, and look at things differently. Whitman is the man that attracts me."</p>
<p>"Whitman?"</p>
<p>"Yes; he's a definite ethical force."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm ashamed to say that I'm a blank on the subject of Whitman. How about you, Tom?"</p>
<p>Tom nodded sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Well," continued Burne, "you may strike a few poems that are tiresome, but I mean the mass of his work. He's tremendous&#8212;like Tolstoi. They both look things in the face, and, somehow, different as they are, stand for somewhat the same things."</p>
<p>"You have me stumped, Burne," Amory admitted. "I've read 'Anna Karenina' and the 'Kreutzer Sonata' of course, but Tolstoi is mostly in the original Russian as far as I'm concerned."</p>
<p>"He's the greatest man in hundreds of years," cried Burne enthusiastically. "Did you ever see a picture of that shaggy old head of his?"</p>
<p>They talked until three, from biology to organized religion, and when Amory crept shivering into bed it was with his mind aglow with ideas and a sense of shock that some one else had discovered the path he might have followed. Burne Holiday was so evidently developing&#8212;and Amory had considered that he was doing the same. He had fallen into a deep cynicism over what had crossed his path, plotted the imperfectability of man and read Shaw and Chesterton enough to keep his mind from the edges of decadence&#8212;now suddenly all his mental processes of the last year and a half seemed stale and futile&#8212;a petty consummation of himself... and like a sombre background lay that incident of the spring before, that filled half his nights with a dreary terror and made him unable to pray. He was not even a Catholic, yet that was the only ghost of a code that he had, the gaudy, ritualistic, paradoxical Catholicism whose prophet was Chesterton, whose claqueurs were such reformed rakes of literature as Huysmans and Bourget, whose American sponsor was Ralph Adams Cram, with his adulation of thirteenth-century cathedrals&#8212;a Catholicism which Amory found convenient and ready-made, without priest or sacraments or sacrifice.</p>
<p>He could not sleep, so he turned on his reading-lamp and, taking down the "Kreutzer Sonata," searched it carefully for the germs of Burne's enthusiasm. Being Burne was suddenly so much realler than being clever. Yet he sighed... here were other possible clay feet.</p>
<p>He thought back through two years, of Burne as a hurried, nervous freshman, quite submerged in his brother's personality. Then he remembered an incident of sophomore year, in which Burne had been suspected of the leading role.</p>
<p>Dean Hollister had been heard by a large group arguing with a taxi-driver, who had driven him from the junction. In the course of the altercation the dean remarked that he "might as well buy the taxicab." He paid and walked off, but next morning he entered his private office to find the taxicab itself in the space usually occupied by his desk, bearing a sign which read "Property of Dean Hollister. Bought and Paid for."... It took two expert mechanics half a day to dissemble it into its minutest parts and remove it, which only goes to prove the rare energy of sophomore humor under efficient leadership.</p>
<p>Then again, that very fall, Burne had caused a sensation. A certain Phyllis Styles, an intercollegiate prom-trotter, had failed to get her yearly invitation to the Harvard-Princeton game.</p>
<p>Jesse Ferrenby had brought her to a smaller game a few weeks before, and had pressed Burne into service&#8212;to the ruination of the latter's misogyny.</p>
<p>"Are you coming to the Harvard game?" Burne had asked indiscreetly, merely to make conversation.</p>
<p>"If you ask me," cried Phyllis quickly.</p>
<p>"Of course I do," said Burne feebly. He was unversed in the arts of Phyllis, and was sure that this was merely a vapid form of kidding. Before an hour had passed he knew that he was indeed involved. Phyllis had pinned him down and served him up, informed him the train she was arriving by, and depressed him thoroughly. Aside from loathing Phyllis, he had particularly wanted to stag that game and entertain some Harvard friends.</p>
<p>"She'll see," he informed a delegation who arrived in his room to josh him. "This will be the last game she ever persuades any young innocent to take her to!"</p>
<p>"But, Burne&#8212;why did you <i>invite</i> her if you didn't want her?"</p>
<p>"Burne, you <i>know</i> you're secretly mad about her&#8212;that's the <i>real</i> trouble."</p>
<p>"What can <i>you</i> do, Burne? What can <i>you</i> do against Phyllis?"</p>
<p>But Burne only shook his head and muttered threats which consisted largely of the phrase: "She'll see, she'll see!"</p>
<p>The blithesome Phyllis bore her twenty-five summers gayly from the train, but on the platform a ghastly sight met her eyes. There were Burne and Fred Sloane arrayed to the last dot like the lurid figures on college posters. They had bought flaring suits with huge peg-top trousers and gigantic padded shoulders. On their heads were rakish college hats, pinned up in front and sporting bright orange-and-black bands, while from their celluloid collars blossomed flaming orange ties. They wore black arm-bands with orange "P's," and carried canes flying Princeton pennants, the effect completed by socks and peeping handkerchiefs in the same color motifs. On a clanking chain they led a large, angry tom-cat, painted to represent a tiger.</p>
<p>A good half of the station crowd was already staring at them, torn between horrified pity and riotous mirth, and as Phyllis, with her svelte jaw dropping, approached, the pair bent over and emitted a college cheer in loud, far-carrying voices, thoughtfully adding the name "Phyllis" to the end. She was vociferously greeted and escorted enthusiastically across the campus, followed by half a hundred village urchins&#8212;to the stifled laughter of hundreds of alumni and visitors, half of whom had no idea that this was a practical joke, but thought that Burne and Fred were two varsity sports showing their girl a collegiate time.</p>
<p>Phyllis's feelings as she was paraded by the Harvard and Princeton stands, where sat dozens of her former devotees, can be imagined. She tried to walk a little ahead, she tried to walk a little behind&#8212;but they stayed close, that there should be no doubt whom she was with, talking in loud voices of their friends on the football team, until she could almost hear her acquaintances whispering:</p>
<p>"Phyllis Styles must be <i>awfully hard up</i> to have to come with <i>those two</i>."</p>
<p>That had been Burne, dynamically humorous, fundamentally serious. From that root had blossomed the energy that he was now trying to orient with progress....</p>
<p>So the weeks passed and March came and the clay feet that Amory looked for failed to appear. About a hundred juniors and seniors resigned from their clubs in a final fury of righteousness, and the clubs in helplessness turned upon Burne their finest weapon: ridicule. Every one who knew him liked him&#8212;but what he stood for (and he began to stand for more all the time) came under the lash of many tongues, until a frailer man than he would have been snowed under.</p>
<p>"Don't you mind losing prestige?" asked Amory one night. They had taken to exchanging calls several times a week.</p>
<p>"Of course I don't. What's prestige, at best?"</p>
<p>"Some people say that you're just a rather original politician."</p>
<p>He roared with laughter.</p>
<p>"That's what Fred Sloane told me to-day. I suppose I have it coming."</p>
<p>One afternoon they dipped into a subject that had interested Amory for a long time&#8212;the matter of the bearing of physical attributes on a man's make-up. Burne had gone into the biology of this, and then:</p>
<p>"Of course health counts&#8212;a healthy man has twice the chance of being good," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't agree with you&#8212;I don't believe in 'muscular Christianity.'"</p>
<p>"I do&#8212;I believe Christ had great physical vigor."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Amory protested. "He worked too hard for that. I imagine that when he died he was a broken-down man&#8212;and the great saints haven't been strong."</p>
<p>"Half of them have."</p>
<p>"Well, even granting that, I don't think health has anything to do with goodness; of course, it's valuable to a great saint to be able to stand enormous strains, but this fad of popular preachers rising on their toes in simulated virility, bellowing that calisthenics will save the world&#8212;no, Burne, I can't go that."</p>
<p>"Well, let's waive it&#8212;we won't get anywhere, and besides I haven't quite made up my mind about it myself. Now, here's something I <i>do</i> know&#8212;personal appearance has a lot to do with it."</p>
<p>"Coloring?" Amory asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"That's what Tom and I figured," Amory agreed. "We took the year-books for the last ten years and looked at the pictures of the senior council. I know you don't think much of that august body, but it does represent success here in a general way. Well, I suppose only about thirty-five per cent of every class here are blonds, are really light&#8212;yet <i>two-thirds</i> of every senior council are light. We looked at pictures of ten years of them, mind you; that means that out of every <i>fifteen</i> light-haired men in the senior class <i>one</i> is on the senior council, and of the dark-haired men it's only one in <i>fifty</i>."</p>
<p>"It's true," Burne agreed. "The light-haired man <i>is</i> a higher type, generally speaking. I worked the thing out with the Presidents of the United States once, and found that way over half of them were light-haired&#8212;yet think of the preponderant number of brunettes in the race."</p>
<p>"People unconsciously admit it," said Amory. "You'll notice a blond person is <i>expected</i> to talk. If a blond girl doesn't talk we call her a 'doll'; if a light-haired man is silent he's considered stupid. Yet the world is full of 'dark silent men' and 'languorous brunettes' who haven't a brain in their heads, but somehow are never accused of the dearth."</p>
<p>"And the large mouth and broad chin and rather big nose undoubtedly make the superior face."</p>
<p>"I'm not so sure." Amory was all for classical features.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes&#8212;I'll show you," and Burne pulled out of his desk a photographic collection of heavily bearded, shaggy celebrities&#8212;Tolstoi, Whitman, Carpenter, and others.</p>
<p>"Aren't they wonderful?"</p>
<p>Amory tried politely to appreciate them, and gave up laughingly.</p>
<p>"Burne, I think they're the ugliest-looking crowd I ever came across. They look like an old man's home."</p>
<p>"Oh, Amory, look at that forehead on Emerson; look at Tolstoi's eyes." His tone was reproachful.</p>
<p>Amory shook his head.</p>
<p>"No! Call them remarkable-looking or anything you want&#8212;but ugly they certainly are."</p>
<p>Unabashed, Burne ran his hand lovingly across the spacious foreheads, and piling up the pictures put them back in his desk.</p>
<p>Walking at night was one of his favorite pursuits, and one night he persuaded Amory to accompany him.</p>
<p>"I hate the dark," Amory objected. "I didn't use to&#8212;except when I was particularly imaginative, but now, I really do&#8212;I'm a regular fool about it."</p>
<p>"That's useless, you know."</p>
<p>"Quite possibly."</p>
<p>"We'll go east," Burne suggested, "and down that string of roads through the woods."</p>
<p>"Doesn't sound very appealing to me," admitted Amory reluctantly, "but let's go."</p>
<p>They set off at a good gait, and for an hour swung along in a brisk argument until the lights of Princeton were luminous white blots behind them.</p>
<p>"Any person with any imagination is bound to be afraid," said Burne earnestly. "And this very walking at night is one of the things I was afraid about. I'm going to tell you why I can walk anywhere now and not be afraid."</p>
<p>"Go on," Amory urged eagerly. They were striding toward the woods, Burne's nervous, enthusiastic voice warming to his subject.</p>
<p>"I used to come out here alone at night, oh, three months ago, and I always stopped at that cross-road we just passed. There were the woods looming up ahead, just as they do now, there were dogs howling and the shadows and no human sound. Of course, I peopled the woods with everything ghastly, just like you do; don't you?"</p>
<p>"I do," Amory admitted.</p>
<p>"Well, I began analyzing it&#8212;my imagination persisted in sticking horrors into the dark&#8212;so I stuck my imagination into the dark instead, and let it look out at me&#8212;I let it play stray dog or escaped convict or ghost, and then saw myself coming along the road. That made it all right&#8212;as it always makes everything all right to project yourself completely into another's place. I knew that if I were the dog or the convict or the ghost I wouldn't be a menace to Burne Holiday any more than he was a menace to me. Then I thought of my watch. I'd better go back and leave it and then essay the woods. No; I decided, it's better on the whole that I should lose a watch than that I should turn back&#8212;and I did go into them&#8212;not only followed the road through them, but walked into them until I wasn't frightened any more&#8212;did it until one night I sat down and dozed off in there; then I knew I was through being afraid of the dark."</p>
<p>"Lordy," Amory breathed. "I couldn't have done that. I'd have come out half-way, and the first time an automobile passed and made the dark thicker when its lamps disappeared, I'd have come in."</p>
<p>"Well," Burne said suddenly, after a few moments' silence, "we're half-way through, let's turn back."</p>
<p>On the return he launched into a discussion of will.</p>
<p>"It's the whole thing," he asserted. "It's the one dividing line between good and evil. I've never met a man who led a rotten life and didn't have a weak will."</p>
<p>"How about great criminals?"</p>
<p>"They're usually insane. If not, they're weak. There is no such thing as a strong, sane criminal."</p>
<p>"Burne, I disagree with you altogether; how about the superman?"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"He's evil, I think, yet he's strong and sane."</p>
<p>"I've never met him. I'll bet, though, that he's stupid or insane."</p>
<p>"I've met him over and over and he's neither. That's why I think you're wrong."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I'm not&#8212;and so I don't believe in imprisonment except for the insane."</p>
<p>On this point Amory could not agree. It seemed to him that life and history were rife with the strong criminal, keen, but often self-deluding; in politics and business one found him and among the old statesmen and kings and generals; but Burne never agreed and their courses began to split on that point.</p>
<p>Burne was drawing farther and farther away from the world about him. He resigned the vice-presidency of the senior class and took to reading and walking as almost his only pursuits. He voluntarily attended graduate lectures in philosophy and biology, and sat in all of them with a rather pathetically intent look in his eyes, as if waiting for something the lecturer would never quite come to. Sometimes Amory would see him squirm in his seat; and his face would light up; he was on fire to debate a point.</p>
<p>He grew more abstracted on the street and was even accused of becoming a snob, but Amory knew it was nothing of the sort, and once when Burne passed him four feet off, absolutely unseeingly, his mind a thousand miles away, Amory almost choked with the romantic joy of watching him. Burne seemed to be climbing heights where others would be forever unable to get a foothold.</p>
<p>"I tell you," Amory declared to Tom, "he's the first contemporary I've ever met whom I'll admit is my superior in mental capacity."</p>
<p>"It's a bad time to admit it&#8212;people are beginning to think he's odd."</p>
<p>"He's way over their heads&#8212;you know you think so yourself when you talk to him&#8212;Good Lord, Tom, you <i>used</i> to stand out against 'people.' Success has completely conventionalized you."</p>
<p>Tom grew rather annoyed.</p>
<p>"What's he trying to do&#8212;be excessively holy?"</p>
<p>"No! not like anybody you've ever seen. Never enters the Philadelphian Society. He has no faith in that rot. He doesn't believe that public swimming-pools and a kind word in time will right the wrongs of the world; moreover, he takes a drink whenever he feels like it."</p>
<p>"He certainly is getting in wrong."</p>
<p>"Have you talked to him lately?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then you haven't any conception of him."</p>
<p>The argument ended nowhere, but Amory noticed more than ever how the sentiment toward Burne had changed on the campus.</p>
<p>"It's odd," Amory said to Tom one night when they had grown more amicable on the subject, "that the people who violently disapprove of Burne's radicalism are distinctly the Pharisee class&#8212;I mean they're the best-educated men in college&#8212;the editors of the papers, like yourself and Ferrenby, the younger professors.... The illiterate athletes like Langueduc think he's getting eccentric, but they just say, 'Good old Burne has got some queer ideas in his head,' and pass on&#8212;the Pharisee class&#8212;Gee! they ridicule him unmercifully."</p>
<p>The next morning he met Burne hurrying along McCosh walk after a recitation.</p>
<p>"Whither bound, Tsar?"</p>
<p>"Over to the Prince office to see Ferrenby," he waved a copy of the morning's Princetonian at Amory. "He wrote this editorial."</p>
<p>"Going to flay him alive?"</p>
<p>"No&#8212;but he's got me all balled up. Either I've misjudged him or he's suddenly become the world's worst radical."</p>
<p>Burne hurried on, and it was several days before Amory heard an account of the ensuing conversation. Burne had come into the editor's sanctum displaying the paper cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Hello, Jesse."</p>
<p>"Hello there, Savonarola."</p>
<p>"I just read your editorial."</p>
<p>"Good boy&#8212;didn't know you stooped that low."</p>
<p>"Jesse, you startled me."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid the faculty'll get after you if you pull this irreligious stuff?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Like this morning."</p>
<p>"What the devil&#8212;that editorial was on the coaching system."</p>
<p>"Yes, but that quotation&#8212;"</p>
<p>Jesse sat up.</p>
<p>"What quotation?"</p>
<p>"You know: 'He who is not with me is against me.'"</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;what about it?"</p>
<p>Jesse was puzzled but not alarmed.</p>
<p>"Well, you say here&#8212;let me see." Burne opened the paper and read: "'<i>He who is not with me is against me</i>, as that gentleman said who was notoriously capable of only coarse distinctions and puerile generalities.'"</p>
<p>"What of it?" Ferrenby began to look alarmed. "Oliver Cromwell said it, didn't he? or was it Washington, or one of the saints? Good Lord, I've forgotten."</p>
<p>Burne roared with laughter.</p>
<p>"Oh, Jesse, oh, good, kind Jesse."</p>
<p>"Who said it, for Pete's sake?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Burne, recovering his voice, "St. Matthew attributes it to Christ."</p>
<p>"My God!" cried Jesse, and collapsed backward into the waste-basket.</p>

<p>AMORY WRITES A POEM</p>
<p>The weeks tore by. Amory wandered occasionally to New York on the chance of finding a new shining green auto-bus, that its stick-of-candy glamour might penetrate his disposition. One day he ventured into a stock-company revival of a play whose name was faintly familiar. The curtain rose&#8212;he watched casually as a girl entered. A few phrases rang in his ear and touched a faint chord of memory. Where&#8212;? When&#8212;?</p>
<p>Then he seemed to hear a voice whispering beside him, a very soft, vibrant voice: "Oh, I'm such a poor little fool; <i>do</i> tell me when I do wrong."</p>
<p>The solution came in a flash and he had a quick, glad memory of Isabelle.</p>
<p>He found a blank space on his programme, and began to scribble rapidly:</p>
