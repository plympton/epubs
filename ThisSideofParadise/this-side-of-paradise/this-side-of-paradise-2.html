<p>"That's good," Kerry would say softly. "It pleases the elder Holiday. That's a great poet, I guess." Tom, delighted at an audience, would ramble through the "Poems and Ballades" until Kerry and Amory knew them almost as well as he.</p>
<p>Amory took to writing poetry on spring afternoons, in the gardens of the big estates near Princeton, while swans made effective atmosphere in the artificial pools, and slow clouds sailed harmoniously above the willows. May came too soon, and suddenly unable to bear walls, he wandered the campus at all hours through starlight and rain.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A DAMP SYMBOLIC INTERLUDE</p>
<p>The night mist fell. From the moon it rolled, clustered about the spires and towers, and then settled below them, so that the dreaming peaks were still in lofty aspiration toward the sky. Figures that dotted the day like ants now brushed along as shadowy ghosts, in and out of the foreground. The Gothic halls and cloisters were infinitely more mysterious as they loomed suddenly out of the darkness, outlined each by myriad faint squares of yellow light. Indefinitely from somewhere a bell boomed the quarter-hour, and Amory, pausing by the sun-dial, stretched himself out full length on the damp grass. The cool bathed his eyes and slowed the flight of time&#8212;time that had crept so insidiously through the lazy April afternoons, seemed so intangible in the long spring twilights. Evening after evening the senior singing had drifted over the campus in melancholy beauty, and through the shell of his undergraduate consciousness had broken a deep and reverent devotion to the gray walls and Gothic peaks and all they symbolized as warehouses of dead ages.</p>
<p>The tower that in view of his window sprang upward, grew into a spire, yearning higher until its uppermost tip was half invisible against the morning skies, gave him the first sense of the transiency and unimportance of the campus figures except as holders of the apostolic succession. He liked knowing that Gothic architecture, with its upward trend, was peculiarly appropriate to universities, and the idea became personal to him. The silent stretches of green, the quiet halls with an occasional late-burning scholastic light held his imagination in a strong grasp, and the chastity of the spire became a symbol of this perception.</p>
<p>"Damn it all," he whispered aloud, wetting his hands in the damp and running them through his hair. "Next year I work!" Yet he knew that where now the spirit of spires and towers made him dreamily acquiescent, it would then overawe him. Where now he realized only his own inconsequence, effort would make him aware of his own impotency and insufficiency.</p>
<p>The college dreamed on&#8212;awake. He felt a nervous excitement that might have been the very throb of its slow heart. It was a stream where he was to throw a stone whose faint ripple would be vanishing almost as it left his hand. As yet he had given nothing, he had taken nothing.</p>
<p>A belated freshman, his oilskin slicker rasping loudly, slushed along the soft path. A voice from somewhere called the inevitable formula, "Stick out your head!" below an unseen window. A hundred little sounds of the current drifting on under the fog pressed in finally on his consciousness.</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" he cried suddenly, and started at the sound of his voice in the stillness. The rain dripped on. A minute longer he lay without moving, his hands clinched. Then he sprang to his feet and gave his clothes a tentative pat.</p>
<p>"I'm very damn wet!" he said aloud to the sun-dial.</p>
<hr/>
<p>HISTORICAL</p>
<p>The war began in the summer following his freshman year. Beyond a sporting interest in the German dash for Paris the whole affair failed either to thrill or interest him. With the attitude he might have held toward an amusing melodrama he hoped it would be long and bloody. If it had not continued he would have felt like an irate ticket-holder at a prize-fight where the principals refused to mix it up.</p>
<p>That was his total reaction.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"HA-HA HORTENSE!"</p>
<p>"All right, ponies!"</p>
<p>"Shake it up!"</p>
<p>"Hey, ponies&#8212;how about easing up on that crap game and shaking a mean hip?"</p>
<p>"Hey, <i>ponies!</i>"</p>
<p>The coach fumed helplessly, the Triangle Club president, glowering with anxiety, varied between furious bursts of authority and fits of temperamental lassitude, when he sat spiritless and wondered how the devil the show was ever going on tour by Christmas.</p>
<p>"All right. We'll take the pirate song."</p>
<p>The ponies took last drags at their cigarettes and slumped into place; the leading lady rushed into the foreground, setting his hands and feet in an atmospheric mince; and as the coach clapped and stamped and tumped and da-da'd, they hashed out a dance.</p>
<p>A great, seething ant-hill was the Triangle Club. It gave a musical comedy every year, travelling with cast, chorus, orchestra, and scenery all through Christmas vacation. The play and music were the work of undergraduates, and the club itself was the most influential of institutions, over three hundred men competing for it every year.</p>
<p>Amory, after an easy victory in the first sophomore Princetonian competition, stepped into a vacancy of the cast as Boiling Oil, a Pirate Lieutenant. Every night for the last week they had rehearsed "Ha-Ha Hortense!" in the Casino, from two in the afternoon until eight in the morning, sustained by dark and powerful coffee, and sleeping in lectures through the interim. A rare scene, the Casino. A big, barnlike auditorium, dotted with boys as girls, boys as pirates, boys as babies; the scenery in course of being violently set up; the spotlight man rehearsing by throwing weird shafts into angry eyes; over all the constant tuning of the orchestra or the cheerful tumpty-tump of a Triangle tune. The boy who writes the lyrics stands in the corner, biting a pencil, with twenty minutes to think of an encore; the business manager argues with the secretary as to how much money can be spent on "those damn milkmaid costumes"; the old graduate, president in ninety-eight, perches on a box and thinks how much simpler it was in his day.</p>
<p>How a Triangle show ever got off was a mystery, but it was a riotous mystery, anyway, whether or not one did enough service to wear a little gold Triangle on his watch-chain. "Ha-Ha Hortense!" was written over six times and had the names of nine collaborators on the programme. All Triangle shows started by being "something different&#8212;not just a regular musical comedy," but when the several authors, the president, the coach and the faculty committee finished with it, there remained just the old reliable Triangle show with the old reliable jokes and the star comedian who got expelled or sick or something just before the trip, and the dark-whiskered man in the pony-ballet, who "absolutely won't shave twice a day, doggone it!"</p>
<p>There was one brilliant place in "Ha-Ha Hortense!" It is a Princeton tradition that whenever a Yale man who is a member of the widely advertised "Skull and Bones" hears the sacred name mentioned, he must leave the room. It is also a tradition that the members are invariably successful in later life, amassing fortunes or votes or coupons or whatever they choose to amass. Therefore, at each performance of "Ha-Ha Hortense!" half-a-dozen seats were kept from sale and occupied by six of the worst-looking vagabonds that could be hired from the streets, further touched up by the Triangle make-up man. At the moment in the show where Firebrand, the Pirate Chief, pointed at his black flag and said, "I am a Yale graduate&#8212;note my Skull and Bones!"&#8212;at this very moment the six vagabonds were instructed to rise <i>conspicuously</i> and leave the theatre with looks of deep melancholy and an injured dignity. It was claimed though never proved that on one occasion the hired Elis were swelled by one of the real thing.</p>
<p>They played through vacation to the fashionable of eight cities. Amory liked Louisville and Memphis best: these knew how to meet strangers, furnished extraordinary punch, and flaunted an astonishing array of feminine beauty. Chicago he approved for a certain verve that transcended its loud accent&#8212;however, it was a Yale town, and as the Yale Glee Club was expected in a week the Triangle received only divided homage. In Baltimore, Princeton was at home, and every one fell in love. There was a proper consumption of strong waters all along the line; one man invariably went on the stage highly stimulated, claiming that his particular interpretation of the part required it. There were three private cars; however, no one slept except in the third car, which was called the "animal car," and where were herded the spectacled wind-jammers of the orchestra. Everything was so hurried that there was no time to be bored, but when they arrived in Philadelphia, with vacation nearly over, there was rest in getting out of the heavy atmosphere of flowers and grease-paint, and the ponies took off their corsets with abdominal pains and sighs of relief.</p>
<p>When the disbanding came, Amory set out post haste for Minneapolis, for Sally Weatherby's cousin, Isabelle Borge, was coming to spend the winter in Minneapolis while her parents went abroad. He remembered Isabelle only as a little girl with whom he had played sometimes when he first went to Minneapolis. She had gone to Baltimore to live&#8212;but since then she had developed a past.</p>
<p>Amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant. Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him... sat in the train, and thought about himself for thirty-six hours.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"PETTING"</p>
<p>On the Triangle trip Amory had come into constant contact with that great current American phenomenon, the "petting party."</p>
<p>None of the Victorian mothers&#8212;and most of the mothers were Victorian&#8212;had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed. "Servant-girls are that way," says Mrs. Huston-Carmelite to her popular daughter. "They are kissed first and proposed to afterward."</p>
<p>But the Popular Daughter becomes engaged every six months between sixteen and twenty-two, when she arranges a match with young Hambell, of Cambell &amp; Hambell, who fatuously considers himself her first love, and between engagements the P. D. (she is selected by the cut-in system at dances, which favors the survival of the fittest) has other sentimental last kisses in the moonlight, or the firelight, or the outer darkness.</p>
<p>Amory saw girls doing things that even in his memory would have been impossible: eating three-o'clock, after-dance suppers in impossible cafes, talking of every side of life with an air half of earnestness, half of mockery, yet with a furtive excitement that Amory considered stood for a real moral let-down. But he never realized how wide-spread it was until he saw the cities between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile intrigue.</p>
<p>Afternoon at the Plaza, with winter twilight hovering outside and faint drums down-stairs... they strut and fret in the lobby, taking another cocktail, scrupulously attired and waiting. Then the swinging doors revolve and three bundles of fur mince in. The theatre comes afterward; then a table at the Midnight Frolic&#8212;of course, mother will be along there, but she will serve only to make things more secretive and brilliant as she sits in solitary state at the deserted table and thinks such entertainments as this are not half so bad as they are painted, only rather wearying. But the P. D. is in love again... it was odd, wasn't it?&#8212;that though there was so much room left in the taxi the P. D. and the boy from Williams were somehow crowded out and had to go in a separate car. Odd! Didn't you notice how flushed the P. D. was when she arrived just seven minutes late? But the P. D. "gets away with it."</p>
<p>The "belle" had become the "flirt," the "flirt" had become the "baby vamp." The "belle" had five or six callers every afternoon. If the P. D., by some strange accident, has two, it is made pretty uncomfortable for the one who hasn't a date with her. The "belle" was surrounded by a dozen men in the intermissions between dances. Try to find the P. D. between dances, just <i>try</i> to find her.</p>
<p>The same girl... deep in an atmosphere of jungle music and the questioning of moral codes. Amory found it rather fascinating to feel that any popular girl he met before eight he might quite possibly kiss before twelve.</p>
<p>"Why on earth are we here?" he asked the girl with the green combs one night as they sat in some one's limousine, outside the Country Club in Louisville.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'm just full of the devil."</p>
<p>"Let's be frank&#8212;we'll never see each other again. I wanted to come out here with you because I thought you were the best-looking girl in sight. You really don't care whether you ever see me again, do you?"</p>
<p>"No&#8212;but is this your line for every girl? What have I done to deserve it?"</p>
<p>"And you didn't feel tired dancing or want a cigarette or any of the things you said? You just wanted to be&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Oh, let's go in," she interrupted, "if you want to <i>analyze</i>. Let's not <i>talk</i> about it."</p>
<p>When the hand-knit, sleeveless jerseys were stylish, Amory, in a burst of inspiration, named them "petting shirts." The name travelled from coast to coast on the lips of parlor-snakes and P. D.'s.</p>
<hr/>
<p>DESCRIPTIVE</p>
<p>Amory was now eighteen years old, just under six feet tall and exceptionally, but not conventionally, handsome. He had rather a young face, the ingenuousness of which was marred by the penetrating green eyes, fringed with long dark eyelashes. He lacked somehow that intense animal magnetism that so often accompanies beauty in men or women; his personality seemed rather a mental thing, and it was not in his power to turn it on and off like a water-faucet. But people never forgot his face.</p>
<hr/>
<p>ISABELLE</p>
<p>She paused at the top of the staircase. The sensations attributed to divers on spring-boards, leading ladies on opening nights, and lumpy, husky young men on the day of the Big Game, crowded through her. She should have descended to a burst of drums or a discordant blend of themes from "Thais" and "Carmen." She had never been so curious about her appearance, she had never been so satisfied with it. She had been sixteen years old for six months.</p>
<p>"Isabelle!" called her cousin Sally from the doorway of the dressing-room.</p>
<p>"I'm ready." She caught a slight lump of nervousness in her throat.</p>
<p>"I had to send back to the house for another pair of slippers. It'll be just a minute."</p>
<p>Isabelle started toward the dressing-room for a last peek in the mirror, but something decided her to stand there and gaze down the broad stairs of the Minnehaha Club. They curved tantalizingly, and she could catch just a glimpse of two pairs of masculine feet in the hall below. Pump-shod in uniform black, they gave no hint of identity, but she wondered eagerly if one pair were attached to Amory Blaine. This young man, not as yet encountered, had nevertheless taken up a considerable part of her day&#8212;the first day of her arrival. Coming up in the machine from the station, Sally had volunteered, amid a rain of question, comment, revelation, and exaggeration:</p>
<p>"You remember Amory Blaine, of <i>course</i>. Well, he's simply mad to see you again. He's stayed over a day from college, and he's coming to-night. He's heard so much about you&#8212;says he remembers your eyes."</p>
<p>This had pleased Isabelle. It put them on equal terms, although she was quite capable of staging her own romances, with or without advance advertising. But following her happy tremble of anticipation, came a sinking sensation that made her ask:</p>
<p>"How do you mean he's heard about me? What sort of things?"</p>
<p>Sally smiled. She felt rather in the capacity of a showman with her more exotic cousin.</p>
<p>"He knows you're&#8212;you're considered beautiful and all that"&#8212;she paused&#8212;"and I guess he knows you've been kissed."</p>
<p>At this Isabelle's little fist had clinched suddenly under the fur robe. She was accustomed to be thus followed by her desperate past, and it never failed to rouse in her the same feeling of resentment; yet&#8212;in a strange town it was an advantageous reputation. She was a "Speed," was she? Well&#8212;let them find out.</p>
<p>Out of the window Isabelle watched the snow glide by in the frosty morning. It was ever so much colder here than in Baltimore; she had not remembered; the glass of the side door was iced, the windows were shirred with snow in the corners. Her mind played still with one subject. Did <i>he</i> dress like that boy there, who walked calmly down a bustling business street, in moccasins and winter-carnival costume? How very <i>Western!</i> Of course he wasn't that way: he went to Princeton, was a sophomore or something. Really she had no distinct idea of him. An ancient snap-shot she had preserved in an old kodak book had impressed her by the big eyes (which he had probably grown up to by now). However, in the last month, when her winter visit to Sally had been decided on, he had assumed the proportions of a worthy adversary. Children, most astute of match-makers, plot their campaigns quickly, and Sally had played a clever correspondence sonata to Isabelle's excitable temperament. Isabelle had been for some time capable of very strong, if very transient emotions....</p>
<p>They drew up at a spreading, white-stone building, set back from the snowy street. Mrs. Weatherby greeted her warmly and her various younger cousins were produced from the corners where they skulked politely. Isabelle met them tactfully. At her best she allied all with whom she came in contact&#8212;except older girls and some women. All the impressions she made were conscious. The half-dozen girls she renewed acquaintance with that morning were all rather impressed and as much by her direct personality as by her reputation. Amory Blaine was an open subject. Evidently a bit light of love, neither popular nor unpopular&#8212;every girl there seemed to have had an affair with him at some time or other, but no one volunteered any really useful information. He was going to fall for her.... Sally had published that information to her young set and they were retailing it back to Sally as fast as they set eyes on Isabelle. Isabelle resolved secretly that she would, if necessary, <i>force</i> herself to like him&#8212;she owed it to Sally. Suppose she were terribly disappointed. Sally had painted him in such glowing colors&#8212;he was good-looking, "sort of distinguished, when he wants to be," had a line, and was properly inconstant. In fact, he summed up all the romance that her age and environment led her to desire. She wondered if those were his dancing-shoes that fox-trotted tentatively around the soft rug below.</p>
<p>All impressions and, in fact, all ideas were extremely kaleidoscopic to Isabelle. She had that curious mixture of the social and the artistic temperaments found often in two classes, society women and actresses. Her education or, rather, her sophistication, had been absorbed from the boys who had dangled on her favor; her tact was instinctive, and her capacity for love-affairs was limited only by the number of the susceptible within telephone distance. Flirt smiled from her large black-brown eyes and shone through her intense physical magnetism.</p>
<p>So she waited at the head of the stairs that evening while slippers were fetched. Just as she was growing impatient, Sally came out of the dressing-room, beaming with her accustomed good nature and high spirits, and together they descended to the floor below, while the shifting search-light of Isabelle's mind flashed on two ideas: she was glad she had high color to-night, and she wondered if he danced well.</p>
<p>Down-stairs, in the club's great room, she was surrounded for a moment by the girls she had met in the afternoon, then she heard Sally's voice repeating a cycle of names, and found herself bowing to a sextet of black and white, terribly stiff, vaguely familiar figures. The name Blaine figured somewhere, but at first she could not place him. A very confused, very juvenile moment of awkward backings and bumpings followed, and every one found himself talking to the person he least desired to. Isabelle manoeuvred herself and Froggy Parker, freshman at Harvard, with whom she had once played hop-scotch, to a seat on the stairs. A humorous reference to the past was all she needed. The things Isabelle could do socially with one idea were remarkable. First, she repeated it rapturously in an enthusiastic contralto with a soupcon of Southern accent; then she held it off at a distance and smiled at it&#8212;her wonderful smile; then she delivered it in variations and played a sort of mental catch with it, all this in the nominal form of dialogue. Froggy was fascinated and quite unconscious that this was being done, not for him, but for the green eyes that glistened under the shining carefully watered hair, a little to her left, for Isabelle had discovered Amory. As an actress even in the fullest flush of her own conscious magnetism gets a deep impression of most of the people in the front row, so Isabelle sized up her antagonist. First, he had auburn hair, and from her feeling of disappointment she knew that she had expected him to be dark and of garter-advertisement slenderness.... For the rest, a faint flush and a straight, romantic profile; the effect set off by a close-fitting dress suit and a silk ruffled shirt of the kind that women still delight to see men wear, but men were just beginning to get tired of.</p>
<p>During this inspection Amory was quietly watching.</p>
<p>"Don't <i>you</i> think so?" she said suddenly, turning to him, innocent-eyed.</p>
<p>There was a stir, and Sally led the way over to their table. Amory struggled to Isabelle's side, and whispered:</p>
<p>"You're my dinner partner, you know. We're all coached for each other."</p>
<p>Isabelle gasped&#8212;this was rather right in line. But really she felt as if a good speech had been taken from the star and given to a minor character.... She mustn't lose the leadership a bit. The dinner-table glittered with laughter at the confusion of getting places and then curious eyes were turned on her, sitting near the head. She was enjoying this immensely, and Froggy Parker was so engrossed with the added sparkle of her rising color that he forgot to pull out Sally's chair, and fell into a dim confusion. Amory was on the other side, full of confidence and vanity, gazing at her in open admiration. He began directly, and so did Froggy:</p>
<p>"I've heard a lot about you since you wore braids&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Wasn't it funny this afternoon&#8212;"</p>
<p>Both stopped. Isabelle turned to Amory shyly. Her face was always enough answer for any one, but she decided to speak.</p>
<p>"How&#8212;from whom?"</p>
<p>"From everybody&#8212;for all the years since you've been away." She blushed appropriately. On her right Froggy was <i>hors de combat</i> already, although he hadn't quite realized it.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what I remembered about you all these years," Amory continued. She leaned slightly toward him and looked modestly at the celery before her. Froggy sighed&#8212;he knew Amory, and the situations that Amory seemed born to handle. He turned to Sally and asked her if she was going away to school next year. Amory opened with grape-shot.</p>
<p>"I've got an adjective that just fits you." This was one of his favorite starts&#8212;he seldom had a word in mind, but it was a curiosity provoker, and he could always produce something complimentary if he got in a tight corner.</p>
<p>"Oh&#8212;what?" Isabelle's face was a study in enraptured curiosity.</p>
<p>Amory shook his head.</p>
<p>"I don't know you very well yet."</p>
<p>"Will you tell me&#8212;afterward?" she half whispered.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"We'll sit out."</p>
<p>Isabelle nodded.</p>
<p>"Did any one ever tell you, you have keen eyes?" she said.</p>
<p>Amory attempted to make them look even keener. He fancied, but he was not sure, that her foot had just touched his under the table. But it might possibly have been only the table leg. It was so hard to tell. Still it thrilled him. He wondered quickly if there would be any difficulty in securing the little den up-stairs.</p>
<hr/>
<p>BABES IN THE WOODS</p>
<p>Isabelle and Amory were distinctly not innocent, nor were they particularly brazen. Moreover, amateur standing had very little value in the game they were playing, a game that would presumably be her principal study for years to come. She had begun as he had, with good looks and an excitable temperament, and the rest was the result of accessible popular novels and dressing-room conversation culled from a slightly older set. Isabelle had walked with an artificial gait at nine and a half, and when her eyes, wide and starry, proclaimed the ingenue most. Amory was proportionately less deceived. He waited for the mask to drop off, but at the same time he did not question her right to wear it. She, on her part, was not impressed by his studied air of blas&#233; sophistication. She had lived in a larger city and had slightly an advantage in range. But she accepted his pose&#8212;it was one of the dozen little conventions of this kind of affair. He was aware that he was getting this particular favor now because she had been coached; he knew that he stood for merely the best game in sight, and that he would have to improve his opportunity before he lost his advantage. So they proceeded with an infinite guile that would have horrified her parents.</p>
<p>After the dinner the dance began... smoothly. Smoothly?&#8212;boys cut in on Isabelle every few feet and then squabbled in the corners with: "You might let me get more than an inch!" and "She didn't like it either&#8212;she told me so next time I cut in." It was true&#8212;she told every one so, and gave every hand a parting pressure that said: "You know that your dances are <i>making</i> my evening."</p>
<p>But time passed, two hours of it, and the less subtle beaux had better learned to focus their pseudo-passionate glances elsewhere, for eleven o'clock found Isabelle and Amory sitting on the couch in the little den off the reading-room up-stairs. She was conscious that they were a handsome pair, and seemed to belong distinctively in this seclusion, while lesser lights fluttered and chattered down-stairs.</p>
<p>Boys who passed the door looked in enviously&#8212;girls who passed only laughed and frowned and grew wise within themselves.</p>
<p>They had now reached a very definite stage. They had traded accounts of their progress since they had met last, and she had listened to much she had heard before. He was a sophomore, was on the Princetonian board, hoped to be chairman in senior year. He learned that some of the boys she went with in Baltimore were "terrible speeds" and came to dances in states of artificial stimulation; most of them were twenty or so, and drove alluring red Stutzes. A good half seemed to have already flunked out of various schools and colleges, but some of them bore athletic names that made him look at her admiringly. As a matter of fact, Isabelle's closer acquaintance with the universities was just commencing. She had bowing acquaintance with a lot of young men who thought she was a "pretty kid&#8212;worth keeping an eye on." But Isabelle strung the names into a fabrication of gayety that would have dazzled a Viennese nobleman. Such is the power of young contralto voices on sink-down sofas.</p>
<p>He asked her if she thought he was conceited. She said there was a difference between conceit and self-confidence. She adored self-confidence in men.</p>
<p>"Is Froggy a good friend of yours?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Rather&#8212;why?"</p>
<p>"He's a bum dancer."</p>
<p>Amory laughed.</p>
<p>"He dances as if the girl were on his back instead of in his arms."</p>
<p>She appreciated this.</p>
<p>"You're awfully good at sizing people up."</p>
<p>Amory denied this painfully. However, he sized up several people for her. Then they talked about hands.</p>
<p>"You've got awfully nice hands," she said. "They look as if you played the piano. Do you?"</p>
<p>I have said they had reached a very definite stage&#8212;nay, more, a very critical stage. Amory had stayed over a day to see her, and his train left at twelve-eighteen that night. His trunk and suitcase awaited him at the station; his watch was beginning to hang heavy in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Isabelle," he said suddenly, "I want to tell you something." They had been talking lightly about "that funny look in her eyes," and Isabelle knew from the change in his manner what was coming&#8212;indeed, she had been wondering how soon it would come. Amory reached above their heads and turned out the electric light, so that they were in the dark, except for the red glow that fell through the door from the reading-room lamps. Then he began:</p>
<p>"I don't know whether or not you know what you&#8212;what I'm going to say. Lordy, Isabelle&#8212;this <i>sounds</i> like a line, but it isn't."</p>
<p>"I know," said Isabelle softly.</p>
<p>"Maybe we'll never meet again like this&#8212;I have darned hard luck sometimes." He was leaning away from her on the other arm of the lounge, but she could see his eyes plainly in the dark.</p>
<p>"You'll meet me again&#8212;silly." There was just the slightest emphasis on the last word&#8212;so that it became almost a term of endearment. He continued a bit huskily:</p>
<p>"I've fallen for a lot of people&#8212;girls&#8212;and I guess you have, too&#8212;boys, I mean, but, honestly, you&#8212;" he broke off suddenly and leaned forward, chin on his hands: "Oh, what's the use&#8212;you'll go your way and I suppose I'll go mine."</p>
<p>Silence for a moment. Isabelle was quite stirred; she wound her handkerchief into a tight ball, and by the faint light that streamed over her, dropped it deliberately on the floor. Their hands touched for an instant, but neither spoke. Silences were becoming more frequent and more delicious. Outside another stray couple had come up and were experimenting on the piano in the next room. After the usual preliminary of "chopsticks," one of them started "Babes in the Woods" and a light tenor carried the words into the den:</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160; "Give me your hand<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; I'll understand<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; We're off to slumberland."<br/>
</div>
<p>Isabelle hummed it softly and trembled as she felt Amory's hand close over hers.</p>
<p>"Isabelle," he whispered. "You know I'm mad about you. You <i>do</i> give a darn about me."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How much do you care&#8212;do you like any one better?"</p>
<p>"No." He could scarcely hear her, although he bent so near that he felt her breath against his cheek.</p>
<p>"Isabelle, I'm going back to college for six long months, and why shouldn't we&#8212;if I could only just have one thing to remember you by&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Close the door...." Her voice had just stirred so that he half wondered whether she had spoken at all. As he swung the door softly shut, the music seemed quivering just outside.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160; "Moonlight is bright,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; Kiss me good night."<br/>
</div>
<p>What a wonderful song, she thought&#8212;everything was wonderful to-night, most of all this romantic scene in the den, with their hands clinging and the inevitable looming charmingly close. The future vista of her life seemed an unending succession of scenes like this: under moonlight and pale starlight, and in the backs of warm limousines and in low, cosy roadsters stopped under sheltering trees&#8212;only the boy might change, and this one was so nice. He took her hand softly. With a sudden movement he turned it and, holding it to his lips, kissed the palm.</p>
<p>"Isabelle!" His whisper blended in the music, and they seemed to float nearer together. Her breath came faster. "Can't I kiss you, Isabelle&#8212;Isabelle?" Lips half parted, she turned her head to him in the dark. Suddenly the ring of voices, the sound of running footsteps surged toward them. Quick as a flash Amory reached up and turned on the light, and when the door opened and three boys, the wrathy and dance-craving Froggy among them, rushed in, he was turning over the magazines on the table, while she sat without moving, serene and unembarrassed, and even greeted them with a welcoming smile. But her heart was beating wildly, and she felt somehow as if she had been deprived.</p>
<p>It was evidently over. There was a clamor for a dance, there was a glance that passed between them&#8212;on his side despair, on hers regret, and then the evening went on, with the reassured beaux and the eternal cutting in.</p>
<p>At quarter to twelve Amory shook hands with her gravely, in the midst of a small crowd assembled to wish him good-speed. For an instant he lost his poise, and she felt a bit rattled when a satirical voice from a concealed wit cried:</p>
<p>"Take her outside, Amory!" As he took her hand he pressed it a little, and she returned the pressure as she had done to twenty hands that evening&#8212;that was all.</p>
<p>At two o'clock back at the Weatherbys' Sally asked her if she and Amory had had a "time" in the den. Isabelle turned to her quietly. In her eyes was the light of the idealist, the inviolate dreamer of Joan-like dreams.</p>
<p>"No," she answered. "I don't do that sort of thing any more; he asked me to, but I said no."</p>
<p>As she crept in bed she wondered what he'd say in his special delivery to-morrow. He had such a good-looking mouth&#8212;would she ever&#8212;?</p>
<p>"Fourteen angels were watching o'er them," sang Sally sleepily from the next room.</p>
<p>"Damn!" muttered Isabelle, punching the pillow into a luxurious lump and exploring the cold sheets cautiously. "Damn!"</p>

<p>CARNIVAL</p>
<p>Amory, by way of the Princetonian, had arrived. The minor snobs, finely balanced thermometers of success, warmed to him as the club elections grew nigh, and he and Tom were visited by groups of upper classmen who arrived awkwardly, balanced on the edge of the furniture and talked of all subjects except the one of absorbing interest. Amory was amused at the intent eyes upon him, and, in case the visitors represented some club in which he was not interested, took great pleasure in shocking them with unorthodox remarks.</p>
<p>"Oh, let me see&#8212;" he said one night to a flabbergasted delegation, "what club do you represent?"</p>
<p>With visitors from Ivy and Cottage and Tiger Inn he played the "nice, unspoilt, ingenuous boy" very much at ease and quite unaware of the object of the call.</p>
<p>When the fatal morning arrived, early in March, and the campus became a document in hysteria, he slid smoothly into Cottage with Alec Connage and watched his suddenly neurotic class with much wonder.</p>
<p>There were fickle groups that jumped from club to club; there were friends of two or three days who announced tearfully and wildly that they must join the same club, nothing should separate them; there were snarling disclosures of long-hidden grudges as the Suddenly Prominent remembered snubs of freshman year. Unknown men were elevated into importance when they received certain coveted bids; others who were considered "all set" found that they had made unexpected enemies, felt themselves stranded and deserted, talked wildly of leaving college.</p>
<p>In his own crowd Amory saw men kept out for wearing green hats, for being "a damn tailor's dummy," for having "too much pull in heaven," for getting drunk one night "not like a gentleman, by God," or for unfathomable secret reasons known to no one but the wielders of the black balls.</p>
<p>This orgy of sociability culminated in a gigantic party at the Nassau Inn, where punch was dispensed from immense bowls, and the whole down-stairs became a delirious, circulating, shouting pattern of faces and voices.</p>
<p>"Hi, Dibby&#8212;'gratulations!"</p>
<p>"Goo' boy, Tom, you got a good bunch in Cap."</p>
<p>"Say, Kerry&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Oh, Kerry&#8212;I hear you went Tiger with all the weight-lifters!" "Well, I didn't go Cottage&#8212;the parlor-snakes' delight."</p>
<p>"They say Overton fainted when he got his Ivy bid&#8212;Did he sign up the first day?&#8212;oh, <i>no</i>. Tore over to Murray-Dodge on a bicycle&#8212;afraid it was a mistake."</p>
<p>"How'd you get into Cap&#8212;you old roue?"</p>
<p>"'Gratulations!"</p>
<p>"'Gratulations yourself. Hear you got a good crowd."</p>
<p>When the bar closed, the party broke up into groups and streamed, singing, over the snow-clad campus, in a weird delusion that snobbishness and strain were over at last, and that they could do what they pleased for the next two years.</p>
<p>Long afterward Amory thought of sophomore spring as the happiest time of his life. His ideas were in tune with life as he found it; he wanted no more than to drift and dream and enjoy a dozen new-found friendships through the April afternoons.</p>
<p>Alec Connage came into his room one morning and woke him up into the sunshine and peculiar glory of Campbell Hall shining in the window.</p>
<p>"Wake up, Original Sin, and scrape yourself together. Be in front of Renwick's in half an hour. Somebody's got a car." He took the bureau cover and carefully deposited it, with its load of small articles, upon the bed.</p>
<p>"Where'd you get the car?" demanded Amory cynically.</p>
<p>"Sacred trust, but don't be a critical goopher or you can't go!"</p>
<p>"I think I'll sleep," Amory said calmly, resettling himself and reaching beside the bed for a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Sleep!"</p>
<p>"Why not? I've got a class at eleven-thirty."</p>
<p>"You damned gloom! Of course, if you don't want to go to the coast&#8212;"</p>
<p>With a bound Amory was out of bed, scattering the bureau cover's burden on the floor. The coast... he hadn't seen it for years, since he and his mother were on their pilgrimage.</p>
<p>"Who's going?" he demanded as he wriggled into his B. V. D.'s.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dick Humbird and Kerry Holiday and Jesse Ferrenby and&#8212;oh about five or six. Speed it up, kid!"</p>
<p>In ten minutes Amory was devouring cornflakes in Renwick's, and at nine-thirty they bowled happily out of town, headed for the sands of Deal Beach.</p>
<p>"You see," said Kerry, "the car belongs down there. In fact, it was stolen from Asbury Park by persons unknown, who deserted it in Princeton and left for the West. Heartless Humbird here got permission from the city council to deliver it."</p>
<p>"Anybody got any money?" suggested Ferrenby, turning around from the front seat.</p>
<p>There was an emphatic negative chorus.</p>
<p>"That makes it interesting."</p>
<p>"Money&#8212;what's money? We can sell the car."</p>
<p>"Charge him salvage or something."</p>
<p>"How're we going to get food?" asked Amory.</p>
<p>"Honestly," answered Kerry, eying him reprovingly, "do you doubt Kerry's ability for three short days? Some people have lived on nothing for years at a time. Read the Boy Scout Monthly."</p>
<p>"Three days," Amory mused, "and I've got classes."</p>
<p>"One of the days is the Sabbath."</p>
<p>"Just the same, I can only cut six more classes, with over a month and a half to go."</p>
<p>"Throw him out!"</p>
<p>"It's a long walk back."</p>
<p>"Amory, you're running it out, if I may coin a new phrase."</p>
<p>"Hadn't you better get some dope on yourself, Amory?"</p>
<p>Amory subsided resignedly and drooped into a contemplation of the scenery. Swinburne seemed to fit in somehow.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">&#160;&#160; "Oh, winter's rains and ruins are over,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And all the seasons of snows and sins;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; The days dividing lover and lover,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The light that loses, the night that wins;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; And time remembered is grief forgotten,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And frosts are slain and flowers begotten,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160; And in green underwood and cover,<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Blossom by blossom the spring begins.<br/><br/>&#160;&#160; "The full streams feed on flower of&#8212;"<br/>
</div>
<p>"What's the matter, Amory? Amory's thinking about poetry, about the pretty birds and flowers. I can see it in his eye."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not," he lied. "I'm thinking about the Princetonian. I ought to make up to-night; but I can telephone back, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Kerry respectfully, "these important men&#8212;"</p>
<p>Amory flushed and it seemed to him that Ferrenby, a defeated competitor, winced a little. Of course, Kerry was only kidding, but he really mustn't mention the Princetonian.</p>
<p>It was a halcyon day, and as they neared the shore and the salt breezes scurried by, he began to picture the ocean and long, level stretches of sand and red roofs over blue sea. Then they hurried through the little town and it all flashed upon his consciousness to a mighty paean of emotion....</p>
<p>"Oh, good Lord! <i>Look</i> at it!" he cried.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Let me out, quick&#8212;I haven't seen it for eight years! Oh, gentlefolk, stop the car!"</p>
<p>"What an odd child!" remarked Alec.</p>
<p>"I do believe he's a bit eccentric."</p>
<p>The car was obligingly drawn up at a curb, and Amory ran for the boardwalk. First, he realized that the sea was blue and that there was an enormous quantity of it, and that it roared and roared&#8212;really all the banalities about the ocean that one could realize, but if any one had told him then that these things were banalities, he would have gaped in wonder.</p>
<p>"Now we'll get lunch," ordered Kerry, wandering up with the crowd. "Come on, Amory, tear yourself away and get practical."</p>
<p>"We'll try the best hotel first," he went on, "and thence and so forth."</p>
<p>They strolled along the boardwalk to the most imposing hostelry in sight, and, entering the dining-room, scattered about a table.</p>
<p>"Eight Bronxes," commanded Alec, "and a club sandwich and Juliennes. The food for one. Hand the rest around."</p>
<p>Amory ate little, having seized a chair where he could watch the sea and feel the rock of it. When luncheon was over they sat and smoked quietly.</p>
<p>"What's the bill?"</p>
<p>Some one scanned it.</p>
<p>"Eight twenty-five."</p>
<p>"Rotten overcharge. We'll give them two dollars and one for the waiter. Kerry, collect the small change."</p>
<p>The waiter approached, and Kerry gravely handed him a dollar, tossed two dollars on the check, and turned away. They sauntered leisurely toward the door, pursued in a moment by the suspicious Ganymede.</p>
<p>"Some mistake, sir."</p>
<p>Kerry took the bill and examined it critically.</p>
<p>"No mistake!" he said, shaking his head gravely, and, tearing it into four pieces, he handed the scraps to the waiter, who was so dumfounded that he stood motionless and expressionless while they walked out.</p>
<p>"Won't he send after us?"</p>
<p>"No," said Kerry; "for a minute he'll think we're the proprietor's sons or something; then he'll look at the check again and call the manager, and in the meantime&#8212;"</p>
<p>They left the car at Asbury and street-car'd to Allenhurst, where they investigated the crowded pavilions for beauty. At four there were refreshments in a lunch-room, and this time they paid an even smaller per cent on the total cost; something about the appearance and savoir-faire of the crowd made the thing go, and they were not pursued.</p>
<p>"You see, Amory, we're Marxian Socialists," explained Kerry. "We don't believe in property and we're putting it to the great test."</p>
<p>"Night will descend," Amory suggested.</p>
<p>"Watch, and put your trust in Holiday."</p>
<p>They became jovial about five-thirty and, linking arms, strolled up and down the boardwalk in a row, chanting a monotonous ditty about the sad sea waves. Then Kerry saw a face in the crowd that attracted him and, rushing off, reappeared in a moment with one of the homeliest girls Amory had ever set eyes on. Her pale mouth extended from ear to ear, her teeth projected in a solid wedge, and she had little, squinty eyes that peeped ingratiatingly over the side sweep of her nose. Kerry presented them formally.</p>
<p>"Name of Kaluka, Hawaiian queen! Let me present Messrs. Connage, Sloane, Humbird, Ferrenby, and Blaine."</p>
<p>The girl bobbed courtesies all around. Poor creature; Amory supposed she had never before been noticed in her life&#8212;possibly she was half-witted. While she accompanied them (Kerry had invited her to supper) she said nothing which could discountenance such a belief.</p>
<p>"She prefers her native dishes," said Alec gravely to the waiter, "but any coarse food will do."</p>
<p>All through supper he addressed her in the most respectful language, while Kerry made idiotic love to her on the other side, and she giggled and grinned. Amory was content to sit and watch the by-play, thinking what a light touch Kerry had, and how he could transform the barest incident into a thing of curve and contour. They all seemed to have the spirit of it more or less, and it was a relaxation to be with them. Amory usually liked men individually, yet feared them in crowds unless the crowd was around him. He wondered how much each one contributed to the party, for there was somewhat of a spiritual tax levied. Alec and Kerry were the life of it, but not quite the centre. Somehow the quiet Humbird, and Sloane, with his impatient superciliousness, were the centre.</p>
<p>Dick Humbird had, ever since freshman year, seemed to Amory a perfect type of aristocrat. He was slender but well-built&#8212;black curly hair, straight features, and rather a dark skin. Everything he said sounded intangibly appropriate. He possessed infinite courage, an averagely good mind, and a sense of honor with a clear charm and <i>noblesse oblige</i> that varied it from righteousness. He could dissipate without going to pieces, and even his most bohemian adventures never seemed "running it out." People dressed like him, tried to talk as he did.... Amory decided that he probably held the world back, but he wouldn't have changed him. ...</p>
<p>He differed from the healthy type that was essentially middle class&#8212;he never seemed to perspire. Some people couldn't be familiar with a chauffeur without having it returned; Humbird could have lunched at Sherry's with a colored man, yet people would have somehow known that it was all right. He was not a snob, though he knew only half his class. His friends ranged from the highest to the lowest, but it was impossible to "cultivate" him. Servants worshipped him, and treated him like a god. He seemed the eternal example of what the upper class tries to be.</p>
<p>"He's like those pictures in the Illustrated London News of the English officers who have been killed," Amory had said to Alec. "Well," Alec had answered, "if you want to know the shocking truth, his father was a grocery clerk who made a fortune in Tacoma real estate and came to New York ten years ago."</p>
<p>Amory had felt a curious sinking sensation.</p>
<p>This present type of party was made possible by the surging together of the class after club elections&#8212;as if to make a last desperate attempt to know itself, to keep together, to fight off the tightening spirit of the clubs. It was a let-down from the conventional heights they had all walked so rigidly.</p>
<p>After supper they saw Kaluka to the boardwalk, and then strolled back along the beach to Asbury. The evening sea was a new sensation, for all its color and mellow age was gone, and it seemed the bleak waste that made the Norse sagas sad; Amory thought of Kipling's</p>
