<p>The car slowed up at the entrance to a great estate, ringed around by a huge hedge and a tall iron fence.</p>
<p>"Won't you come in for lunch?"</p>
<p>Amory shook his head.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Ferrenby, but I've got to get on."</p>
<p>The big man held out his hand. Amory saw that the fact that he had known Jesse more than outweighed any disfavor he had created by his opinions. What ghosts were people with which to work! Even the little man insisted on shaking hands.</p>
<p>"Good-by!" shouted Mr. Ferrenby, as the car turned the corner and started up the drive. "Good luck to you and bad luck to your theories."</p>
<p>"Same to you, sir," cried Amory, smiling and waving his hand.</p>

<p>"OUT OF THE FIRE, OUT OF THE LITTLE ROOM"</p>
<p>Eight hours from Princeton Amory sat down by the Jersey roadside and looked at the frost-bitten country. Nature as a rather coarse phenomenon composed largely of flowers that, when closely inspected, appeared moth-eaten, and of ants that endlessly traversed blades of grass, was always disillusioning; nature represented by skies and waters and far horizons was more likable. Frost and the promise of winter thrilled him now, made him think of a wild battle between St. Regis and Groton, ages ago, seven years ago&#8212;and of an autumn day in France twelve months before when he had lain in tall grass, his platoon flattened down close around him, waiting to tap the shoulders of a Lewis gunner. He saw the two pictures together with somewhat the same primitive exaltation&#8212;two games he had played, differing in quality of acerbity, linked in a way that differed them from Rosalind or the subject of labyrinths which were, after all, the business of life.</p>
<p>"I am selfish," he thought.</p>
<p>"This is not a quality that will change when I 'see human suffering' or 'lose my parents' or 'help others.'</p>
<p>"This selfishness is not only part of me. It is the most living part.</p>
<p>"It is by somehow transcending rather than by avoiding that selfishness that I can bring poise and balance into my life.</p>
<p>"There is no virtue of unselfishness that I cannot use. I can make sacrifices, be charitable, give to a friend, endure for a friend, lay down my life for a friend&#8212;all because these things may be the best possible expression of myself; yet I have not one drop of the milk of human kindness."</p>
<p>The problem of evil had solidified for Amory into the problem of sex. He was beginning to identify evil with the strong phallic worship in Brooke and the early Wells. Inseparably linked with evil was beauty&#8212;beauty, still a constant rising tumult; soft in Eleanor's voice, in an old song at night, rioting deliriously through life like superimposed waterfalls, half rhythm, half darkness. Amory knew that every time he had reached toward it longingly it had leered out at him with the grotesque face of evil. Beauty of great art, beauty of all joy, most of all the beauty of women.</p>
<p>After all, it had too many associations with license and indulgence. Weak things were often beautiful, weak things were never good. And in this new loneness of his that had been selected for what greatness he might achieve, beauty must be relative or, itself a harmony, it would make only a discord.</p>
<p>In a sense this gradual renunciation of beauty was the second step after his disillusion had been made complete. He felt that he was leaving behind him his chance of being a certain type of artist. It seemed so much more important to be a certain sort of man.</p>
<p>His mind turned a corner suddenly and he found himself thinking of the Catholic Church. The idea was strong in him that there was a certain intrinsic lack in those to whom orthodox religion was necessary, and religion to Amory meant the Church of Rome. Quite conceivably it was an empty ritual but it was seemingly the only assimilative, traditionary bulwark against the decay of morals. Until the great mobs could be educated into a moral sense some one must cry: "Thou shalt not!" Yet any acceptance was, for the present, impossible. He wanted time and the absence of ulterior pressure. He wanted to keep the tree without ornaments, realize fully the direction and momentum of this new start.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The afternoon waned from the purging good of three o'clock to the golden beauty of four. Afterward he walked through the dull ache of a setting sun when even the clouds seemed bleeding and at twilight he came to a graveyard. There was a dusky, dreamy smell of flowers and the ghost of a new moon in the sky and shadows everywhere. On an impulse he considered trying to open the door of a rusty iron vault built into the side of a hill; a vault washed clean and covered with late-blooming, weepy watery-blue flowers that might have grown from dead eyes, sticky to the touch with a sickening odor.</p>
<p>Amory wanted to feel "William Dayfield, 1864."</p>
<p>He wondered that graves ever made people consider life in vain. Somehow he could find nothing hopeless in having lived. All the broken columns and clasped hands and doves and angels meant romances. He fancied that in a hundred years he would like having young people speculate as to whether his eyes were brown or blue, and he hoped quite passionately that his grave would have about it an air of many, many years ago. It seemed strange that out of a row of Union soldiers two or three made him think of dead loves and dead lovers, when they were exactly like the rest, even to the yellowish moss.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Long after midnight the towers and spires of Princeton were visible, with here and there a late-burning light&#8212;and suddenly out of the clear darkness the sound of bells. As an endless dream it went on; the spirit of the past brooding over a new generation, the chosen youth from the muddled, unchastened world, still fed romantically on the mistakes and half-forgotten dreams of dead statesmen and poets. Here was a new generation, shouting the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a revery of long days and nights; destined finally to go out into that dirty gray turmoil to follow love and pride; a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success; grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken....</p>
<p>Amory, sorry for them, was still not sorry for himself&#8212;art, politics, religion, whatever his medium should be, he knew he was safe now, free from all hysteria&#8212;he could accept what was acceptable, roam, grow, rebel, sleep deep through many nights....</p>
<p>There was no God in his heart, he knew; his ideas were still in riot; there was ever the pain of memory; the regret for his lost youth&#8212;yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul, responsibility and a love of life, the faint stirring of old ambitions and unrealized dreams. But&#8212;oh, Rosalind! Rosalind!...</p>
<p>"It's all a poor substitute at best," he said sadly.</p>
<p>And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while, why he had determined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from the personalities he had passed....</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky.</p>
<p>"I know myself," he cried, "but that is all."</p>
