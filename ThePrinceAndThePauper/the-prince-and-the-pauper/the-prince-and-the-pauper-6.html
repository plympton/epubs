<p>"A beggar and a thief! &#160;He has got your money and has picked your pocket likewise. &#160;An' thou would'st do a healing miracle, lay thy staff over his shoulders and trust Providence for the rest."</p>
<p>But Hugo did not tarry for the miracle. &#160;In a moment he was up and off like the wind, the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry lustily as he went. &#160;The King, breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for his own release, fled in the opposite direction, and did not slacken his pace until he was out of harm's reach. &#160;He took the first road that offered, and soon put the village behind him. &#160;He hurried along, as briskly as he could, during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over his shoulder for pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful sense of security took their place. &#160;He recognised, now, that he was hungry, and also very tired. &#160;So he halted at a farmhouse; but when he was about to speak, he was cut short and driven rudely away. &#160;His clothes were against him.</p>
<p>He wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put himself in the way of like treatment no more. &#160;But hunger is pride's master; so, as the evening drew near, he made an attempt at another farmhouse; but here he fared worse than before; for he was called hard names and was promised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly.</p>
<p>The night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore monarch laboured slowly on. &#160;He was obliged to keep moving, for every time he sat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold. &#160;All his sensations and experiences, as he moved through the solemn gloom and the empty vastness of the night, were new and strange to him. &#160;At intervals he heard voices approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and as he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of formless drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about it all that made him shudder. &#160;Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a light&#8212;always far away, apparently&#8212;almost in another world; if he heard the tinkle of a sheep's bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct; the muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in vanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then came the complaining howl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds were remote; they made the little King feel that all life and activity were far removed from him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in the centre of a measureless solitude.</p>
<p>He stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new experience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves overhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand. &#160;He stepped back into the shadows and waited. &#160;The lantern stood by the open door of a barn. &#160;The King waited some time&#8212;there was no sound, and nobody stirring. &#160;He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable barn looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and enter. He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing the threshold he heard voices behind him. &#160;He darted behind a cask, within the barn, and stooped down. &#160;Two farm-labourers came in, bringing the lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile. &#160;Whilst they moved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took the bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end of the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to himself. &#160;He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway of the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the crown of England for one night.</p>
<p>By-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind them and taking the lantern with them. &#160;The shivering King made for the blankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them up, and then groped his way safely to the stall. &#160;Of two of the blankets he made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two. &#160;He was a glad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite warm enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost suffocatingly powerful.</p>
<p>Although the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage of the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of semi-consciousness. &#160;Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself wholly, he distinctly felt something touch him! &#160;He was broad awake in a moment, and gasping for breath. &#160;The cold horror of that mysterious touch in the dark almost made his heart stand still. &#160;He lay motionless, and listened, scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was no sound. &#160;He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long time, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound. &#160;So he began to drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that mysterious touch again! &#160;It was a grisly thing, this light touch from this noiseless and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly fears. &#160;What should he do? &#160;That was the question; but he did not know how to answer it. &#160;Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters and fly from this inscrutable horror? &#160;But fly whither? &#160;He could not get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and thither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls, with this phantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch upon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was intolerable. &#160;But to stay where he was, and endure this living death all night&#8212;was that better? &#160;No. &#160;What, then, was there left to do? &#160;Ah, there was but one course; he knew it well&#8212;he must put out his hand and find that thing!</p>
<p>It was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try it. Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark, gingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp&#8212;not because it had encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just <i>going</i> to. &#160;But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his hand lightly swept against something soft and warm. &#160;This petrified him, nearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine the thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm. He thought he would rather die than touch it again. &#160;But he thought this false thought because he did not know the immortal strength of human curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping again&#8212;against his judgment, and without his consent&#8212;but groping persistently on, just the same. &#160;It encountered a bunch of long hair; he shuddered, but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm rope; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!&#8212;for the rope was not a rope at all, but the calf's tail.</p>
<p>The King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he need not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened him, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and any other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and suffered just as he had done.</p>
<p>The King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a calf, but delighted to have the calf's company; for he had been feeling so lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even this humble animal were welcome. &#160;And he had been so buffeted, so rudely entreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel that he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at least a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes might be lacking. &#160;So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with the calf.</p>
<p>While stroking its sleek warm back&#8212;for it lay near him and within easy reach&#8212;it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways than one. &#160;Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to the calf; then he cuddled himself up to the calf's back, drew the covers up over himself and his friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and comfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace of Westminster.</p>
<p>Pleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller seeming. &#160;He was free of the bonds of servitude and crime, free of the companionship of base and brutal outlaws; he was warm; he was sheltered; in a word, he was happy. &#160;The night wind was rising; it swept by in fitful gusts that made the old barn quake and rattle, then its forces died down at intervals, and went moaning and wailing around corners and projections&#8212;but it was all music to the King, now that he was snug and comfortable: let it blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan and wail, he minded it not, he only enjoyed it. &#160;He merely snuggled the closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted blissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that was full of serenity and peace. &#160;The distant dogs howled, the melancholy kine complained, and the winds went on raging, whilst furious sheets of rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty of England slept on, undisturbed, and the calf did the same, it being a simple creature, and not easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00019">Chapter XIX. The Prince with the peasants.</h2>
<p>When the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet but thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy bed for itself in his bosom. &#160;Being disturbed now, it scampered away. The boy smiled, and said, "Poor fool, why so fearful? &#160;I am as forlorn as thou. &#160;'Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so helpless. &#160;Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king has fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely meaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no lower go."</p>
<p>He got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard the sound of children's voices. &#160;The barn door opened and a couple of little girls came in. &#160;As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased, and they stopped and stood still, gazing at him with strong curiosity; they presently began to whisper together, then they approached nearer, and stopped again to gaze and whisper. &#160;By-and-by they gathered courage and began to discuss him aloud. &#160;One said&#8212;</p>
<p>"He hath a comely face."</p>
<p>The other added&#8212;</p>
<p>"And pretty hair."</p>
<p>"But is ill clothed enow."</p>
<p>"And how starved he looketh."</p>
<p>They came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining him minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of animal, but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he might be a sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion. &#160;Finally they halted before him, holding each other's hands for protection, and took a good satisfying stare with their innocent eyes; then one of them plucked up all her courage and inquired with honest directness&#8212;</p>
<p>"Who art thou, boy?"</p>
<p>"I am the King," was the grave answer.</p>
<p>The children gave a little start, and their eyes spread themselves wide open and remained so during a speechless half minute. &#160;Then curiosity broke the silence&#8212;</p>
<p>"The <i>King</i>? &#160;What King?"</p>
<p>"The King of England."</p>
<p>The children looked at each other&#8212;then at him&#8212;then at each other again&#8212;wonderingly, perplexedly; then one said&#8212;</p>
<p>"Didst hear him, Margery?&#8212;he said he is the King. &#160;Can that be true?"</p>
<p>"How can it be else but true, Prissy? &#160;Would he say a lie? &#160;For look you, Prissy, an' it were not true, it <i>would</i> be a lie. &#160;It surely would be. Now think on't. &#160;For all things that be not true, be lies&#8212;thou canst make nought else out of it."</p>
<p>It was a good tight argument, without a leak in it anywhere; and it left Prissy's half-doubts not a leg to stand on. &#160;She considered a moment, then put the King upon his honour with the simple remark&#8212;</p>
<p>"If thou art truly the King, then I believe thee."</p>
<p>"I am truly the King."</p>
<p>This settled the matter. &#160;His Majesty's royalty was accepted without further question or discussion, and the two little girls began at once to inquire into how he came to be where he was, and how he came to be so unroyally clad, and whither he was bound, and all about his affairs. &#160;It was a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not be scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting even his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids. &#160;But when he got down to his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without food, they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a breakfast for him.</p>
<p>The King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, "When I am come to mine own again, I will always honour little children, remembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time of trouble; whilst they that were older, and thought themselves wiser, mocked at me and held me for a liar."</p>
<p>The children's mother received the King kindly, and was full of pity; for his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her womanly heart. &#160;She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had seen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate. &#160;She imagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or keepers; so she tried to find out whence he had come, in order that she might take measures to return him; but all her references to neighbouring towns and villages, and all her inquiries in the same line went for nothing&#8212;the boy's face, and his answers, too, showed that the things she was talking of were not familiar to him. &#160;He spoke earnestly and simply about court matters, and broke down, more than once, when speaking of the late King 'his father'; but whenever the conversation changed to baser topics, he lost interest and became silent.</p>
<p>The woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up. &#160;As she proceeded with her cooking, she set herself to contriving devices to surprise the boy into betraying his real secret. &#160;She talked about cattle&#8212;he showed no concern; then about sheep&#8212;the same result: &#160;so her guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error; she talked about mills; and about weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all sorts; and about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats: &#160;but no matter, she was baffled at all points. &#160;Not altogether, either; for she argued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service. &#160;Yes, she was sure she was on the right track, now; he must have been a house servant. &#160;So she led up to that. &#160;But the result was discouraging. The subject of sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir him; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm. The goodwife touched, with a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the subject of cooking. &#160;To her surprise, and her vast delight, the King's face lighted at once! &#160;Ah, she had hunted him down at last, she thought; and she was right proud, too, of the devious shrewdness and tact which had accomplished it.</p>
<p>Her tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King's, inspired by gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering pots and pans, turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an eloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes, that within three minutes the woman said to herself, "Of a truth I was right&#8212;he hath holpen in a kitchen!" &#160;Then he broadened his bill of fare, and discussed it with such appreciation and animation, that the goodwife said to herself, "Good lack! how can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones withal? &#160;For these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great. &#160;Ah, now I see! ragged outcast as he is, he must have served in the palace before his reason went astray; yes, he must have helped in the very kitchen of the King himself! &#160;I will test him."</p>
<p>Full of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to mind the cooking a moment&#8212;hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or two, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave her children a sign to follow after. &#160;The King muttered&#8212;</p>
<p>"Another English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone time&#8212;it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the great Alfred stooped to assume. &#160;But I will try to better serve my trust than he; for he let the cakes burn."</p>
<p>The intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to it, for this King, like the other one, soon fell into deep thinkings concerning his vast affairs, and the same calamity resulted&#8212;the cookery got burned. The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire destruction; and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a brisk and cordial tongue-lashing. Then, seeing how troubled he was over his violated trust, she softened at once, and was all goodness and gentleness toward him.</p>
<p>The boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly refreshed and gladdened by it. &#160;It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious feature, that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither recipient of the favour was aware that it had been extended. &#160;The goodwife had intended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner, like any other tramp or like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the scolding she had given him, that she did what she could to atone for it by allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on ostensible terms of equality with them; and the King, on his side, was so remorseful for having broken his trust, after the family had been so kind to him, that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself to the family level, instead of requiring the woman and her children to stand and wait upon him, while he occupied their table in the solitary state due to his birth and dignity. &#160;It does us all good to unbend sometimes. &#160;This good woman was made happy all the day long by the applauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension to a tramp; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious humility toward a humble peasant woman.</p>
<p>When breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up the dishes. &#160;This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and the King came near rebelling; but then he said to himself, "Alfred the Great watched the cakes; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too&#8212;therefore will I essay it."</p>
<p>He made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too, for the cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do. It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it at last. &#160;He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now; however, he was not to lose this thrifty dame's society so easily. &#160;She furnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got through with after a fair fashion and with some credit. &#160;Then she set him and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so awkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to grind.</p>
<p>Afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in story-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign. &#160;And when, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket of kittens to drown, he did resign. &#160;At least he was just going to resign&#8212;for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and it seemed to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right thing&#8212;when there was an interruption. &#160;The interruption was John Canty&#8212;with a peddler's pack on his back&#8212;and Hugo.</p>
<p>The King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they had had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about drawing the line, but took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way, without a word. &#160;He left the creatures in an out-house, and hurried on, into a narrow lane at the rear.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00020">Chapter XX. The Prince and the hermit.</h2>
<p>The high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the impulse of a deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the distance. &#160;He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter of the forest; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance. That was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but hurried on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the twilight depths of the wood. Then he stopped; being persuaded that he was now tolerably safe. He listened intently, but the stillness was profound and solemn&#8212;awful, even, and depressing to the spirits. &#160;At wide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so remote, and hollow, and mysterious, that they seemed not to be real sounds, but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed ones. &#160;So the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they interrupted.</p>
<p>It was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the rest of the day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and he was at last obliged to resume movement in order to get warm. He struck straight through the forest, hoping to pierce to a road presently, but he was disappointed in this. &#160;He travelled on and on; but the farther he went, the denser the wood became, apparently. &#160;The gloom began to thicken, by-and-by, and the King realised that the night was coming on. &#160;It made him shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he tried to hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he could not now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously; consequently he kept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers.</p>
<p>And how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light! He approached it warily, stopping often to look about him and listen. &#160;It came from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut. &#160;He heard a voice, now, and felt a disposition to run and hide; but he changed his mind at once, for this voice was praying, evidently. &#160;He glided to the one window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance within. &#160;The room was small; its floor was the natural earth, beaten hard by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or two; near it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or three pots and pans; there was a short bench and a three-legged stool; on the hearth the remains of a faggot fire were smouldering; before a shrine, which was lighted by a single candle, knelt an aged man, and on an old wooden box at his side lay an open book and a human skull. &#160;The man was of large, bony frame; his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white; he was clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his heels.</p>
<p>"A holy hermit!" said the King to himself; "now am I indeed fortunate."</p>
<p>The hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked. &#160;A deep voice responded&#8212;</p>
<p>"Enter!&#8212;but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt stand is holy!"</p>
<p>The King entered, and paused. &#160;The hermit turned a pair of gleaming, unrestful eyes upon him, and said&#8212;</p>
<p>"Who art thou?"</p>
<p>"I am the King," came the answer, with placid simplicity.</p>
<p>"Welcome, King!" cried the hermit, with enthusiasm. &#160;Then, bustling about with feverish activity, and constantly saying, "Welcome, welcome," he arranged his bench, seated the King on it, by the hearth, threw some faggots on the fire, and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous stride.</p>
<p>"Welcome! &#160;Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were not worthy, and were turned away. &#160;But a King who casts his crown away, and despises the vain splendours of his office, and clothes his body in rags, to devote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh&#8212;he is worthy, he is welcome!&#8212;here shall he abide all his days till death come." &#160;The King hastened to interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid no attention to him&#8212;did not even hear him, apparently, but went right on with his talk, with a raised voice and a growing energy. &#160;"And thou shalt be at peace here. &#160;None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee with supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which God hath moved thee to abandon. &#160;Thou shalt pray here; thou shalt study the Book; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world, and upon the sublimities of the world to come; thou shalt feed upon crusts and herbs, and scourge thy body with whips, daily, to the purifying of thy soul. Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin; thou shalt drink water only; and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at peace; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again, baffled; he shall not find thee, he shall not molest thee."</p>
<p>The old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud, and began to mutter. &#160;The King seized this opportunity to state his case; and he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension. &#160;But the hermit went on muttering, and gave no heed. &#160;And still muttering, he approached the King and said impressively&#8212;</p>
<p>"'Sh! &#160;I will tell you a secret!" &#160;He bent down to impart it, but checked himself, and assumed a listening attitude. &#160;After a moment or two he went on tiptoe to the window-opening, put his head out, and peered around in the gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his face close down to the King's, and whispered&#8212;</p>
<p>"I am an archangel!"</p>
<p>The King started violently, and said to himself, "Would God I were with the outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a madman!" &#160;His apprehensions were heightened, and they showed plainly in his face. &#160;In a low excited voice the hermit continued&#8212;</p>
<p>"I see you feel my atmosphere! &#160;There's awe in your face! &#160;None may be in this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for it is the very atmosphere of heaven. &#160;I go thither and return, in the twinkling of an eye. &#160;I was made an archangel on this very spot, it is five years ago, by angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity. &#160;Their presence filled this place with an intolerable brightness. &#160;And they knelt to me, King! yes, they knelt to me! for I was greater than they. &#160;I have walked in the courts of heaven, and held speech with the patriarchs. &#160;Touch my hand&#8212;be not afraid&#8212;touch it. &#160;There&#8212;now thou hast touched a hand which has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob! &#160;For I have walked in the golden courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!" &#160;He paused, to give this speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and he started to his feet again saying, with angry energy, "Yes, I am an archangel; <i>a mere archangel!</i>&#8212;I that might have been pope! &#160;It is verily true. &#160;I was told it from heaven in a dream, twenty years ago; ah, yes, I was to be pope!&#8212;and I <i>should</i> have been pope, for Heaven had said it&#8212;but the King dissolved my religious house, and I, poor obscure unfriended monk, was cast homeless upon the world, robbed of my mighty destiny!" Here he began to mumble again, and beat his forehead in futile rage, with his fist; now and then articulating a venomous curse, and now and then a pathetic "Wherefore I am nought but an archangel&#8212;I that should have been pope!"</p>
<p>So he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and suffered. Then all at once the old man's frenzy departed, and he became all gentleness. &#160;His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and fell to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the King's heart completely. &#160;The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the fire and made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions with a deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a supper&#8212;chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the lad's cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that in a little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were changed to reverence and affection for the man.</p>
<p>This happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper; then, after a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the boy to bed, in a small adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother might; and so, with a parting caress, left him and sat down by the fire, and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way. Presently he paused; then tapped his forehead several times with his fingers, as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his mind. &#160;Apparently he was unsuccessful. &#160;Now he started quickly up, and entered his guest's room, and said&#8212;</p>
<p>"Thou art King?"</p>
<p>"Yes," was the response, drowsily uttered.</p>
<p>"What King?"</p>
<p>"Of England."</p>
<p>"Of England? &#160;Then Henry is gone!"</p>
<p>"Alack, it is so. &#160;I am his son."</p>
<p>A black frown settled down upon the hermit's face, and he clenched his bony hands with a vindictive energy. &#160;He stood a few moments, breathing fast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice&#8212;</p>
<p>"Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and homeless?"</p>
<p>There was no response. &#160;The old man bent down and scanned the boy's reposeful face and listened to his placid breathing. &#160;"He sleeps&#8212;sleeps soundly;" and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of evil satisfaction. &#160;A smile flitted across the dreaming boy's features. The hermit muttered, "So&#8212;his heart is happy;" and he turned away. &#160;He went stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something; now and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head around and casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always muttering, always mumbling to himself. &#160;At last he found what he seemed to want&#8212;a rusty old butcher knife and a whetstone. &#160;Then he crept to his place by the fire, sat himself down, and began to whet the knife softly on the stone, still muttering, mumbling, ejaculating. &#160;The winds sighed around the lonely place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the distances. &#160;The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at the old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on with his work, rapt, absorbed, and noted none of these things.</p>
<p>At long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife, and nodded his head with satisfaction. &#160;"It grows sharper," he said; "yes, it grows sharper."</p>
<p>He took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on, entertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out occasionally in articulate speech&#8212;</p>
<p>"His father wrought us evil, he destroyed us&#8212;and is gone down into the eternal fires! &#160;Yes, down into the eternal fires! &#160;He escaped us&#8212;but it was God's will, yes it was God's will, we must not repine. &#160;But he hath not escaped the fires! &#160;No, he hath not escaped the fires, the consuming, unpitying, remorseless fires&#8212;and <i>they</i> are everlasting!"</p>
<p>And so he wrought, and still wrought&#8212;mumbling, chuckling a low rasping chuckle at times&#8212;and at times breaking again into words&#8212;</p>
<p>"It was his father that did it all. &#160;I am but an archangel; but for him I should be pope!"</p>
<p>The King stirred. &#160;The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside, and went down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate form with his knife uplifted. &#160;The boy stirred again; his eyes came open for an instant, but there was no speculation in them, they saw nothing; the next moment his tranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more.</p>
<p>The hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his position and scarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms, and presently crept away, saying,&#8212;</p>
<p>"It is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry out, lest by accident someone be passing."</p>
<p>He glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there, and another one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle handling he managed to tie the King's ankles together without waking him. &#160;Next he essayed to tie the wrists; he made several attempts to cross them, but the boy always drew one hand or the other away, just as the cord was ready to be applied; but at last, when the archangel was almost ready to despair, the boy crossed his hands himself, and the next moment they were bound. Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper's chin and brought up over his head and tied fast&#8212;and so softly, so gradually, and so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy slept peacefully through it all without stirring.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00021">Chapter XXI. Hendon to the rescue.</h2>
<p>The old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and brought the low bench. &#160;He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and flickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving eyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there, heedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled and chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as a grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay bound and helpless in his web.</p>
<p>After a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,&#8212;yet not seeing, his mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction,&#8212;observed, on a sudden, that the boy's eyes were open! wide open and staring!&#8212;staring up in frozen horror at the knife. &#160;The smile of a gratified devil crept over the old man's face, and he said, without changing his attitude or his occupation&#8212;</p>
<p>"Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?"</p>
<p>The boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time forced a smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit chose to interpret as an affirmative answer to his question.</p>
<p>"Then pray again. &#160;Pray the prayer for the dying!"</p>
<p>A shudder shook the boy's frame, and his face blenched. &#160;Then he struggled again to free himself&#8212;turning and twisting himself this way and that; tugging frantically, fiercely, desperately&#8212;but uselessly&#8212;to burst his fetters; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him, and nodded his head, and placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time to time, "The moments are precious, they are few and precious&#8212;pray the prayer for the dying!"</p>
<p>The boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his struggles, panting. &#160;The tears came, then, and trickled, one after the other, down his face; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the savage old man.</p>
<p>The dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up sharply, with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice&#8212;</p>
<p>"I may not indulge this ecstasy longer! &#160;The night is already gone. &#160;It seems but a moment&#8212;only a moment; would it had endured a year! &#160;Seed of the Church's spoiler, close thy perishing eyes, an' thou fearest to look upon&#8212;"</p>
<p>The rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings. &#160;The old man sank upon his knees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy.</p>
<p>Hark! &#160;There was a sound of voices near the cabin&#8212;the knife dropped from the hermit's hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up, trembling. &#160;The sounds increased, and presently the voices became rough and angry; then came blows, and cries for help; then a clatter of swift footsteps, retreating. &#160;Immediately came a succession of thundering knocks upon the cabin door, followed by&#8212;</p>
<p>"Hullo-o-o! &#160;Open! &#160;And despatch, in the name of all the devils!"</p>
<p>Oh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King's ears; for it was Miles Hendon's voice!</p>
<p>The hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of the bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway the King heard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the 'chapel':&#8212;</p>
<p>"Homage and greeting, reverend sir! &#160;Where is the boy&#8212;<i>my</i> boy?"</p>
<p>"What boy, friend?"</p>
<p>"What boy! &#160;Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!&#8212;I am not in the humour for it. &#160;Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I judged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; they said he was at large again, and they had tracked him to your door. &#160;They showed me his very footprints. &#160;Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an' thou produce him not&#8212;Where is the boy?"</p>
<p>"O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried here the night. &#160;If such as you take an interest in such as he, know, then, that I have sent him of an errand. &#160;He will be back anon."</p>
<p>"How soon? &#160;How soon? &#160;Come, waste not the time&#8212;cannot I overtake him? How soon will he be back?"</p>
<p>"Thou need'st not stir; he will return quickly."</p>
<p>"So be it, then. &#160;I will try to wait. &#160;But stop!&#8212;<i>you</i> sent him of an errand?&#8212;you! &#160;Verily this is a lie&#8212;he would not go. &#160;He would pull thy old beard, an' thou didst offer him such an insolence. Thou hast lied, friend; thou hast surely lied! &#160;He would not go for thee, nor for any man."</p>
<p>"For any <i>man</i>&#8212;no; haply not. &#160;But I am not a man."</p>
<p>"<i>What</i>! &#160;Now o' God's name what art thou, then?"</p>
<p>"It is a secret&#8212;mark thou reveal it not. &#160;I am an archangel!"</p>
<p>There was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon&#8212;not altogether unprofane&#8212;followed by&#8212;</p>
<p>"This doth well and truly account for his complaisance! &#160;Right well I knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any mortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when an archangel gives the word o' command! &#160;Let me&#8212;'sh! &#160;What noise was that?"</p>
<p>All this while the little King had been yonder, alternately quaking with terror and trembling with hope; and all the while, too, he had thrown all the strength he could into his anguished moanings, constantly expecting them to reach Hendon's ear, but always realising, with bitterness, that they failed, or at least made no impression. &#160;So this last remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh fields to the dying; and he exerted himself once more, and with all his energy, just as the hermit was saying&#8212;</p>
<p>"Noise? &#160;I heard only the wind."</p>
<p>"Mayhap it was. &#160;Yes, doubtless that was it. &#160;I have been hearing it faintly all the&#8212;there it is again! &#160;It is not the wind! &#160;What an odd sound! &#160;Come, we will hunt it out!"</p>
<p>Now the King's joy was nearly insupportable. &#160;His tired lungs did their utmost&#8212;and hopefully, too&#8212;but the sealed jaws and the muffling sheepskin sadly crippled the effort. &#160;Then the poor fellow's heart sank, to hear the hermit say&#8212;</p>
<p>"Ah, it came from without&#8212;I think from the copse yonder. &#160;Come, I will lead the way."</p>
<p>The King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps die quickly away&#8212;then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful silence.</p>
<p>It seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching again&#8212;and this time he heard an added sound,&#8212;the trampling of hoofs, apparently. &#160;Then he heard Hendon say&#8212;</p>
<p>"I will not wait longer. &#160;I <i>cannot</i> wait longer. &#160;He has lost his way in this thick wood. &#160;Which direction took he? &#160;Quick&#8212;point it out to me."</p>
<p>"He&#8212;but wait; I will go with thee."</p>
<p>"Good&#8212;good! &#160;Why, truly thou art better than thy looks. &#160;Marry I do not think there's not another archangel with so right a heart as thine. &#160;Wilt ride? &#160;Wilt take the wee donkey that's for my boy, or wilt thou fork thy holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have provided for myself?&#8212;and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the indifferent sum of a month's usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker out of work."</p>
<p>"No&#8212;ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own feet, and will walk."</p>
