<p>He growled these words to the rest of the family&#8212;</p>
<p>"If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London Bridge; whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper's shop on the bridge, let him tarry there till the others be come, then will we flee into Southwark together."</p>
<p>At this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light; and not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude of singing, dancing, and shouting people, massed together on the river frontage. There was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see, up and down the Thames; London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge likewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of coloured lights; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies with an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain of dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were crowds of revellers; all London seemed to be at large.</p>
<p>John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat; but it was too late. &#160;He and his tribe were swallowed up in that swarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from each other in an instant. We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe; Canty still kept his grip upon him. &#160;The Prince's heart was beating high with hopes of escape, now. &#160;A burly waterman, considerably exalted with liquor, found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough through the crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty's shoulder and said&#8212;</p>
<p>"Nay, whither so fast, friend? &#160;Dost canker thy soul with sordid business when all that be leal men and true make holiday?"</p>
<p>"Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not," answered Canty, roughly; "take away thy hand and let me pass."</p>
<p>"Sith that is thy humour, thou'lt <i>not</i> pass, till thou'st drunk to the Prince of Wales, I tell thee that," said the waterman, barring the way resolutely.</p>
<p>"Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!"</p>
<p>Other revellers were interested by this time. &#160;They cried out&#8212;</p>
<p>"The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the loving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes."<a id="footref-6" href="the-prince-and-the-pauper-10.html#foot-6">{6}</a></p>
<p>So a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by one of its handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary napkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty, who had to grasp the opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the other, according to ancient custom. This left the Prince hand-free for a second, of course. &#160;He wasted no time, but dived among the forest of legs about him and disappeared. &#160;In another moment he could not have been harder to find, under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had been the Atlantic's and he a lost sixpence.</p>
<p>He very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself about his own affairs without further thought of John Canty. &#160;He quickly realised another thing, too. &#160;To wit, that a spurious Prince of Wales was being feasted by the city in his stead. &#160;He easily concluded that the pauper lad, Tom Canty, had deliberately taken advantage of his stupendous opportunity and become a usurper.</p>
<p>Therefore there was but one course to pursue&#8212;find his way to the Guildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor. &#160;He also made up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual preparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered, according to the law and usage of the day in cases of high treason.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00011">Chapter XI. At Guildhall.</h2>
<p>The royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its stately way down the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats. The air was laden with music; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames; the distant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible bonfires; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky, incrusted with sparkling lights, wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like jewelled lances thrust aloft; as the fleet swept along, it was greeted from the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless flash and boom of artillery.</p>
<p>To Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds and this spectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing. To his little friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey, they were nothing.</p>
<p>Arrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook (whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under acres of buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and under bridges populous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted, and at last came to a halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard, in the centre of the ancient city of London. &#160;Tom disembarked, and he and his gallant procession crossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and Basinghall Street to the Guildhall.</p>
<p>Tom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord Mayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and scarlet robes of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of the great hall, preceded by heralds making proclamation, and by the Mace and the City Sword. &#160;The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom and his two small friends took their places behind their chairs.</p>
<p>At a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree were seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners took places at a multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall. &#160;From their lofty vantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the ancient guardians of the city, contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar to it in forgotten generations. &#160;There was a bugle-blast and a proclamation, and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward wall, followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a royal baron of beef, smoking hot and ready for the knife.</p>
<p>After grace, Tom (being instructed) rose&#8212;and the whole house with him&#8212;and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess Elizabeth; from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed the general assemblage. &#160;So the banquet began.</p>
<p>By midnight the revelry was at its height. &#160;Now came one of those picturesque spectacles so admired in that old day. &#160;A description of it is still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it:</p>
<p>'Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after the Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on their heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of gold, girded with two swords, called scimitars, hanging by great bawdricks of gold. &#160;Next came yet another baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin, traversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend of crimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of gray on their heads; either of them having an hatchet in their hands, and boots with pykes' (points a foot long), 'turned up. &#160;And after them came a knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five nobles, in doublets of crimson velvet, voyded low on the back and before to the cannell-bone, laced on the breasts with chains of silver; and over that, short cloaks of crimson satin, and on their heads hats after the dancers' fashion, with pheasants' feathers in them. &#160;These were appareled after the fashion of Prussia. &#160;The torchbearers, which were about an hundred, were appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors, their faces black. Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which were disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also, that it was a pleasure to behold.'</p>
<p>And while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this 'wild' dancing, lost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours which the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented, the ragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and his wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and clamouring for admission at the gates of Guildhall! The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously, and pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter. Presently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him into a higher and still more entertaining fury. &#160;Tears of mortification sprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right royally. &#160;Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he exclaimed&#8212;</p>
<p>"I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince of Wales! And all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give me word of grace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from my ground, but will maintain it!"</p>
<p>"Though thou be prince or no prince, 'tis all one, thou be'st a gallant lad, and not friendless neither! &#160;Here stand I by thy side to prove it; and mind I tell thee thou might'st have a worser friend than Miles Hendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking. Rest thy small jaw, my child; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very native."</p>
<p>The speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect, and bearing. &#160;He was tall, trim-built, muscular. &#160;His doublet and trunks were of rich material, but faded and threadbare, and their gold-lace adornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was rumpled and damaged; the plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and disreputable look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron sheath; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of the camp. &#160;The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an explosion of jeers and laughter. &#160;Some cried, "'Tis another prince in disguise!" "'Ware thy tongue, friend: &#160;belike he is dangerous!" &#160;"Marry, he looketh it&#8212;mark his eye!" &#160;"Pluck the lad from him&#8212;to the horse-pond wi' the cub!"</p>
<p>Instantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this happy thought; as instantly the stranger's long sword was out and the meddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it. The next moment a score of voices shouted, "Kill the dog! &#160;Kill him! Kill him!" and the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself against a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a madman. &#160;His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured over their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with undiminished fury.</p>
<p>His moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a trumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, "Way for the King's messenger!" and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of harm's reach as fast as their legs could carry them. The bold stranger caught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away from danger and the multitude.</p>
<p>Return we within the Guildhall. &#160;Suddenly, high above the jubilant roar and thunder of the revel, broke the clear peal of a bugle-note. &#160;There was instant silence&#8212;a deep hush; then a single voice rose&#8212;that of the messenger from the palace&#8212;and began to pipe forth a proclamation, the whole multitude standing listening.</p>
<p>The closing words, solemnly pronounced, were&#8212;</p>
<p>"The King is dead!"</p>
<p>The great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one accord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then all sank upon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward Tom, and a mighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building&#8212;</p>
<p>"Long live the King!"</p>
<p>Poor Tom's dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle, and finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him, a moment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden purpose dawned in his face. &#160;He said, in a low tone, at Lord Hertford's ear&#8212;</p>
<p>"Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour! &#160;Uttered I here a command, the which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter, would such commandment be obeyed, and none rise up to say me nay?"</p>
<p>"None, my liege, in all these realms. &#160;In thy person bides the majesty of England. &#160;Thou art the king&#8212;thy word is law."</p>
<p>Tom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great animation&#8212;</p>
<p>"Then shall the king's law be law of mercy, from this day, and never more be law of blood! &#160;Up from thy knees and away! &#160;To the Tower, and say the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!"</p>
<p>The words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and wide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence, another prodigious shout burst forth&#8212;</p>
<p>"The reign of blood is ended! &#160;Long live Edward, King of England!"<a id="footref-7" href="the-prince-and-the-pauper-10.html#foot-7">{7}</a></p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00012">Chapter XII. The Prince and his Deliverer.</h2>
<p>As soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob, they struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river. &#160;Their way was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge; then they ploughed into the multitude again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon the Prince's&#8212;no, the King's&#8212;wrist. &#160;The tremendous news was already abroad, and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once&#8212;"The King is dead!" &#160;The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little waif, and sent a shudder through his frame. &#160;He realised the greatness of his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who had been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him. &#160;The tears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects. &#160;For an instant he felt himself the most forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God's creatures&#8212;then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching thunders: &#160;"Long live King Edward the Sixth!" and this made his eyes kindle, and thrilled him with pride to his fingers' ends. "Ah," he thought, "how grand and strange it seems&#8212;<i>I am King</i>!"</p>
<p>Our friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the bridge. &#160;This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and had been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious affair, for a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family quarters overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of the river to the other. &#160;The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it had its inn, its beer-houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food markets, its manufacturing industries, and even its church. &#160;It looked upon the two neighbours which it linked together&#8212;London and Southwark&#8212;as being well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise particularly important. &#160;It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was a narrow town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its population was but a village population and everybody in it knew all his fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers before them&#8212;and all their little family affairs into the bargain. &#160;It had its aristocracy, of course&#8212;its fine old families of butchers, and bakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old premises for five or six hundred years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from beginning to end, and all its strange legends; and who always talked bridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and lied in a long, level, direct, substantial bridgy way. &#160;It was just the sort of population to be narrow and ignorant and self-conceited. Children were born on the Bridge, were reared there, grew to old age, and finally died without ever having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge alone. &#160;Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and interminable procession which moved through its street night and day, with its confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing and bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in this world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it. &#160;And so they were, in effect&#8212;at least they could exhibit it from their windows, and did&#8212;for a consideration&#8212;whenever a returning king or hero gave it a fleeting splendour, for there was no place like it for affording a long, straight, uninterrupted view of marching columns.</p>
<p>Men born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and inane elsewhere. &#160;History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at the age of seventy-one and retired to the country. &#160;But he could only fret and toss in his bed; he could not go to sleep, the deep stillness was so painful, so awful, so oppressive. &#160;When he was worn out with it, at last, he fled back to his old home, a lean and haggard spectre, and fell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of the lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge.</p>
<p>In the times of which we are writing, the Bridge furnished 'object lessons' in English history for its children&#8212;namely, the livid and decaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its gateways. &#160;But we digress.</p>
<p>Hendon's lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge. &#160;As he neared the door with his small friend, a rough voice said&#8212;</p>
<p>"So, thou'rt come at last! &#160;Thou'lt not escape again, I warrant thee; and if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat, thou'lt not keep us waiting another time, mayhap,"&#8212;and John Canty put out his hand to seize the boy.</p>
<p>Miles Hendon stepped in the way and said&#8212;</p>
<p>"Not too fast, friend. &#160;Thou art needlessly rough, methinks. &#160;What is the lad to thee?"</p>
<p>"If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others' affairs, he is my son."</p>
<p>"'Tis a lie!" cried the little King, hotly.</p>
<p>"Boldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy small headpiece be sound or cracked, my boy. &#160;But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father or no, 'tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse, according to his threat, so thou prefer to bide with me."</p>
<p>"I do, I do&#8212;I know him not, I loathe him, and will die before I will go with him."</p>
<p>"Then 'tis settled, and there is nought more to say."</p>
<p>"We will see, as to that!" exclaimed John Canty, striding past Hendon to get at the boy; "by force shall he&#8212;"</p>
<p>"If thou do but touch him, thou animated offal, I will spit thee like a goose!" said Hendon, barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword hilt. &#160;Canty drew back. &#160;"Now mark ye," continued Hendon, "I took this lad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled him, mayhap killed him; dost imagine I will desert him now to a worser fate?&#8212;for whether thou art his father or no&#8212;and sooth to say, I think it is a lie&#8212;a decent swift death were better for such a lad than life in such brute hands as thine. &#160;So go thy ways, and set quick about it, for I like not much bandying of words, being not over-patient in my nature."</p>
<p>John Canty moved off, muttering threats and curses, and was swallowed from sight in the crowd. &#160;Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his room, with his charge, after ordering a meal to be sent thither. &#160;It was a poor apartment, with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old furniture in it, and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles. The little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it, almost exhausted with hunger and fatigue. &#160;He had been on his feet a good part of a day and a night (for it was now two or three o'clock in the morning), and had eaten nothing meantime. &#160;He murmured drowsily&#8212;</p>
<p>"Prithee call me when the table is spread," and sank into a deep sleep immediately.</p>
<p>A smile twinkled in Hendon's eye, and he said to himself&#8212;</p>
<p>"By the mass, the little beggar takes to one's quarters and usurps one's bed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them&#8212;with never a by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of the sort. &#160;In his diseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales, and bravely doth he keep up the character. &#160;Poor little friendless rat, doubtless his mind has been disordered with ill-usage. &#160;Well, I will be his friend; I have saved him, and it draweth me strongly to him; already I love the bold-tongued little rascal. &#160;How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble and flung back his high defiance! &#160;And what a comely, sweet and gentle face he hath, now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its griefs. I will teach him; I will cure his malady; yea, I will be his elder brother, and care for him and watch over him; and whoso would shame him or do him hurt may order his shroud, for though I be burnt for it he shall need it!"</p>
<p>He bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying interest, tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the tangled curls with his great brown hand. &#160;A slight shiver passed over the boy's form. Hendon muttered&#8212;</p>
<p>"See, now, how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill his body with deadly rheums. &#160;Now what shall I do? 'twill wake him to take him up and put him within the bed, and he sorely needeth sleep."</p>
<p>He looked about for extra covering, but finding none, doffed his doublet and wrapped the lad in it, saying, "I am used to nipping air and scant apparel, 'tis little I shall mind the cold!"&#8212;then walked up and down the room, to keep his blood in motion, soliloquising as before.</p>
<p>"His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales; 'twill be odd to have a Prince of Wales still with us, now that he that <i>was</i> the prince is prince no more, but king&#8212;for this poor mind is set upon the one fantasy, and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince and call itself the king. . . If my father liveth still, after these seven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon, he will welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake; so will my good elder brother, Arthur; my other brother, Hugh&#8212;but I will crack his crown an <i>he</i> interfere, the fox-hearted, ill-conditioned animal! Yes, thither will we fare&#8212;and straightway, too."</p>
<p>A servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed it upon a small deal table, placed the chairs, and took his departure, leaving such cheap lodgers as these to wait upon themselves. &#160;The door slammed after him, and the noise woke the boy, who sprang to a sitting posture, and shot a glad glance about him; then a grieved look came into his face and he murmured to himself, with a deep sigh, "Alack, it was but a dream, woe is me!" &#160;Next he noticed Miles Hendon's doublet&#8212;glanced from that to Hendon, comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him, and said, gently&#8212;</p>
<p>"Thou art good to me, yes, thou art very good to me. &#160;Take it and put it on&#8212;I shall not need it more."</p>
<p>Then he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood there, waiting. &#160;Hendon said in a cheery voice&#8212;</p>
<p>"We'll have a right hearty sup and bite, now, for everything is savoury and smoking hot, and that and thy nap together will make thee a little man again, never fear!"</p>
<p>The boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, that was filled with grave surprise, and also somewhat touched with impatience, upon the tall knight of the sword. &#160;Hendon was puzzled, and said&#8212;</p>
<p>"What's amiss?"</p>
<p>"Good sir, I would wash me."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that all? &#160;Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou cravest. &#160;Make thyself perfectly free here, and welcome, with all that are his belongings."</p>
<p>Still the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor once or twice with his small impatient foot. &#160;Hendon was wholly perplexed. &#160;Said he&#8212;</p>
<p>"Bless us, what is it?"</p>
<p>"Prithee pour the water, and make not so many words!"</p>
<p>Hendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, "By all the saints, but this is admirable!" stepped briskly forward and did the small insolent's bidding; then stood by, in a sort of stupefaction, until the command, "Come&#8212;the towel!" woke him sharply up. &#160;He took up a towel, from under the boy's nose, and handed it to him without comment. &#160;He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash, and while he was at it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall to. Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the other chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said, indignantly&#8212;</p>
<p>"Forbear! &#160;Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?"</p>
<p>This blow staggered Hendon to his foundations. &#160;He muttered to himself, "Lo, the poor thing's madness is up with the time! &#160;It hath changed with the great change that is come to the realm, and now in fancy is he <i>king</i>! Good lack, I must humour the conceit, too&#8212;there is no other way&#8212;faith, he would order me to the Tower, else!"</p>
<p>And pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table, took his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in the courtliest way he was capable of.</p>
<p>While the King ate, the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little, and with his growing contentment came a desire to talk. He said&#8212;"I think thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sire," Miles replied; then observed to himself, "If I <i>must</i> humour the poor lad's madness, I must 'Sire' him, I must 'Majesty' him, I must not go by halves, I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the part I play, else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable and kindly cause."</p>
<p>The King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine, and said&#8212;"I would know thee&#8212;tell me thy story. &#160;Thou hast a gallant way with thee, and a noble&#8212;art nobly born?"</p>
<p>"We are of the tail of the nobility, good your Majesty. &#160;My father is a baronet&#8212;one of the smaller lords by knight service&#8212;Sir Richard Hendon of Hendon Hall, by Monk's Holm in Kent."</p>
<p>"The name has escaped my memory. &#160;Go on&#8212;tell me thy story."</p>
<p>"'Tis not much, your Majesty, yet perchance it may beguile a short half-hour for want of a better. &#160;My father, Sir Richard, is very rich, and of a most generous nature. &#160;My mother died whilst I was yet a boy. &#160;I have two brothers: &#160;Arthur, my elder, with a soul like to his father's; and Hugh, younger than I, a mean spirit, covetous, treacherous, vicious, underhanded&#8212;a reptile. &#160;Such was he from the cradle; such was he ten years past, when I last saw him&#8212;a ripe rascal at nineteen, I being twenty then, and Arthur twenty-two. &#160;There is none other of us but the Lady Edith, my cousin&#8212;she was sixteen then&#8212;beautiful, gentle, good, the daughter of an earl, the last of her race, heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title. &#160;My father was her guardian. &#160;I loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed to Arthur from the cradle, and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be broken. &#160;Arthur loved another maid, and bade us be of good cheer and hold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give success to our several causes. &#160;Hugh loved the Lady Edith's fortune, though in truth he said it was herself he loved&#8212;but then 'twas his way, alway, to say the one thing and mean the other. &#160;But he lost his arts upon the girl; he could deceive my father, but none else. &#160;My father loved him best of us all, and trusted and believed him; for he was the youngest child, and others hated him&#8212;these qualities being in all ages sufficient to win a parent's dearest love; and he had a smooth persuasive tongue, with an admirable gift of lying&#8212;and these be qualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself. &#160;I was wild&#8212;in troth I might go yet farther and say <i>very</i> wild, though 'twas a wildness of an innocent sort, since it hurt none but me, brought shame to none, nor loss, nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness, or what might not beseem mine honourable degree.</p>
<p>"Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account&#8212;he seeing that our brother Arthur's health was but indifferent, and hoping the worst might work him profit were I swept out of the path&#8212;so&#8212;but 'twere a long tale, good my liege, and little worth the telling. &#160;Briefly, then, this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them crimes; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine apartments&#8212;conveyed thither by his own means&#8212;and did convince my father by this, and suborned evidence of servants and other lying knaves, that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in rank defiance of his will.</p>
<p>"Three years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier and a man of me, my father said, and teach me some degree of wisdom. &#160;I fought out my long probation in the continental wars, tasting sumptuously of hard knocks, privation, and adventure; but in my last battle I was taken captive, and during the seven years that have waxed and waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath harboured me. &#160;Through wit and courage I won to the free air at last, and fled hither straight; and am but just arrived, right poor in purse and raiment, and poorer still in knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall, its people and belongings. &#160;So please you, sir, my meagre tale is told."</p>
<p>"Thou hast been shamefully abused!" said the little King, with a flashing eye. &#160;"But I will right thee&#8212;by the cross will I! &#160;The King hath said it."</p>
<p>Then, fired by the story of Miles's wrongs, he loosed his tongue and poured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his astonished listener. &#160;When he had finished, Miles said to himself&#8212;</p>
<p>"Lo, what an imagination he hath! &#160;Verily, this is no common mind; else, crazed or sane, it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this out of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt. Poor ruined little head, it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I bide with the living. &#160;He shall never leave my side; he shall be my pet, my little comrade. &#160;And he shall be cured!&#8212;ay, made whole and sound&#8212;then will he make himself a name&#8212;and proud shall I be to say, 'Yes, he is mine&#8212;I took him, a homeless little ragamuffin, but I saw what was in him, and I said his name would be heard some day&#8212;behold him, observe him&#8212;was I right?'"</p>
<p>The King spoke&#8212;in a thoughtful, measured voice&#8212;</p>
<p>"Thou didst save me injury and shame, perchance my life, and so my crown. Such service demandeth rich reward. &#160;Name thy desire, and so it be within the compass of my royal power, it is thine."</p>
<p>This fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie. &#160;He was about to thank the King and put the matter aside with saying he had only done his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser thought came into his head, and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the gracious offer&#8212;an idea which the King gravely approved, remarking that it was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import.</p>
<p>Miles reflected during some moments, then said to himself, "Yes, that is the thing to do&#8212;by any other means it were impossible to get at it&#8212;and certes, this hour's experience has taught me 'twould be most wearing and inconvenient to continue it as it is. Yes, I will propose it; 'twas a happy accident that I did not throw the chance away." &#160;Then he dropped upon one knee and said&#8212;</p>
<p>"My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject's simple duty, and therefore hath no merit; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold it worthy some reward, I take heart of grace to make petition to this effect. &#160;Near four hundred years ago, as your grace knoweth, there being ill blood betwixt John, King of England, and the King of France, it was decreed that two champions should fight together in the lists, and so settle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God. &#160;These two kings, and the Spanish king, being assembled to witness and judge the conflict, the French champion appeared; but so redoubtable was he, that our English knights refused to measure weapons with him. &#160;So the matter, which was a weighty one, was like to go against the English monarch by default. &#160;Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest arm in England, stripped of his honours and possessions, and wasting with long captivity. &#160;Appeal was made to him; he gave assent, and came forth arrayed for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge frame and hear his famous name but he fled away, and the French king's cause was lost. &#160;King John restored De Courcy's titles and possessions, and said, 'Name thy wish and thou shalt have it, though it cost me half my kingdom;' whereat De Courcy, kneeling, as I do now, made answer, 'This, then, I ask, my liege; that I and my successors may have and hold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of England, henceforth while the throne shall last.' The boon was granted, as your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four hundred years, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even unto this day, the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the King's Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do. Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to grant to me but this one grace and privilege&#8212;to my more than sufficient reward&#8212;and none other, to wit: &#160;that I and my heirs, for ever, may <i>sit</i> in the presence of the Majesty of England!"</p>
<p>"Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight," said the King, gravely&#8212;giving the accolade with Hendon's sword&#8212;"rise, and seat thyself. &#160;Thy petition is granted. &#160;Whilst England remains, and the crown continues, the privilege shall not lapse."</p>
<p>His Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a chair at table, observing to himself, "'Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought me a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied. An I had not thought of that, I must have had to stand for weeks, till my poor lad's wits are cured." &#160;After a little, he went on, "And so I am become a knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows! A most odd and strange position, truly, for one so matter-of-fact as I. &#160;I will not laugh&#8212;no, God forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to me is <i>real</i> to him. &#160;And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it reflects with truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him." &#160;After a pause: "Ah, what if he should call me by my fine title before folk!&#8212;there'd be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment! &#160;But no matter, let him call me what he will, so it please him; I shall be content."</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00013">Chapter XIII. The disappearance of the Prince.</h2>
<p>A heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades. &#160;The King said&#8212;</p>
<p>"Remove these rags."&#8212;meaning his clothing.</p>
<p>Hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked him up in bed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself, ruefully, "He hath taken my bed again, as before&#8212;marry, what shall <i>I</i> do?" &#160;The little King observed his perplexity, and dissipated it with a word. &#160;He said, sleepily&#8212;</p>
<p>"Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it." &#160;In a moment more he was out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.</p>
<p>"Dear heart, he should have been born a king!" muttered Hendon, admiringly; "he playeth the part to a marvel."</p>
<p>Then he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying contentedly&#8212;</p>
<p>"I have lodged worse for seven years; 'twould be but ill gratitude to Him above to find fault with this."</p>
<p>He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared. &#160;Toward noon he rose, uncovered his unconscious ward&#8212;a section at a time&#8212;and took his measure with a string. &#160;The King awoke, just as he had completed his work, complained of the cold, and asked what he was doing.</p>
<p>"'Tis done, now, my liege," said Hendon; "I have a bit of business outside, but will presently return; sleep thou again&#8212;thou needest it. There&#8212;let me cover thy head also&#8212;thou'lt be warm the sooner."</p>
<p>The King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended. Miles slipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the course of thirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of boy's clothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear; but tidy, and suited to the season of the year. &#160;He seated himself, and began to overhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself&#8212;</p>
<p>"A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has not the long purse one must be content with what a short one may do&#8212;</p>
<p>"'There was a woman in our town,<br/>
In our town did dwell&#8212;'</p>
<p>"He stirred, methinks&#8212;I must sing in a less thunderous key; 'tis not good to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so wearied out, poor chap . . . This garment&#8212;'tis well enough&#8212;a stitch here and another one there will set it aright. &#160;This other is better, albeit a stitch or two will not come amiss in it, likewise . . . <i>These</i> be very good and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and dry&#8212;an odd new thing to him, belike, since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare, winters and summers the same . . . Would thread were bread, seeing one getteth a year's sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle without cost, for mere love. &#160;Now shall I have the demon's own time to thread it!"</p>
<p>And so he had. &#160;He did as men have always done, and probably always will do, to the end of time&#8212;held the needle still, and tried to thrust the thread through the eye, which is the opposite of a woman's way. &#160;Time and time again the thread missed the mark, going sometimes on one side of the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the shaft; but he was patient, having been through these experiences before, when he was soldiering. &#160;He succeeded at last, and took up the garment that had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work.</p>
<p>"The inn is paid&#8212;the breakfast that is to come, included&#8212;and there is wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs for the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at Hendon Hall&#8212;</p>
<p>"'She loved her hus&#8212;'</p>
<p>"Body o' me! &#160;I have driven the needle under my nail! . . . It matters little&#8212;'tis not a novelty&#8212;yet 'tis not a convenience, neither. . . . We shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it! Thy troubles will vanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper&#8212;</p>
<p>"'She loved her husband dearilee,<br/>
But another man&#8212;'</p>
<p>"These be noble large stitches!"&#8212;holding the garment up and viewing it admiringly&#8212;"they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause these small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and plebeian&#8212;</p>
<p>"'She loved her husband dearilee,<br/>
But another man he loved she,&#8212;'</p>
<p>"Marry, 'tis done&#8212;a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought with expedition. &#160;Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him, and then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark and&#8212;be pleased to rise, my liege!&#8212;he answereth not&#8212;what ho, my liege!&#8212;of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch, sith his slumber is deaf to speech. &#160;What!"</p>
<p>He threw back the covers&#8212;the boy was gone!</p>
<p>He stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment; noticed for the first time that his ward's ragged raiment was also missing; then he began to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper. &#160;At that moment a servant entered with the breakfast.</p>
<p>"Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!" roared the man of war, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter could not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and surprise. &#160;"Where is the boy?"</p>
