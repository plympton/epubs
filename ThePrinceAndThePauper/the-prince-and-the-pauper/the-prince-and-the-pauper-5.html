<p>"Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly proven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that they be hanged. &#160;They sold themselves to the devil&#8212;such is their crime."</p>
<p>Tom shuddered. &#160;He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked thing. &#160;Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding his curiosity for all that; so he asked&#8212;</p>
<p>"Where was this done?&#8212;and when?"</p>
<p>"On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty."</p>
<p>Tom shuddered again.</p>
<p>"Who was there present?"</p>
<p>"Only these two, your grace&#8212;and <i>that other</i>."</p>
<p>"Have these confessed?"</p>
<p>"Nay, not so, sire&#8212;they do deny it."</p>
<p>"Then prithee, how was it known?"</p>
<p>"Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this bred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified it. &#160;In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so obtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the region round about. &#160;Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and sooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it, sith all had suffered by it."</p>
<p>"Certes this is a serious matter." &#160;Tom turned this dark piece of scoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked&#8212;</p>
<p>"Suffered the woman also by the storm?"</p>
<p>Several old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of the wisdom of this question. &#160;The sheriff, however, saw nothing consequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness&#8212;</p>
<p>"Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver. Her habitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless."</p>
<p>"Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought. She had been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid her soul, and her child's, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she knoweth not what she doth, therefore sinneth not."</p>
<p>The elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom's wisdom once more, and one individual murmured, "An' the King be mad himself, according to report, then is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I wot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it."</p>
<p>"What age hath the child?" asked Tom.</p>
<p>"Nine years, please your Majesty."</p>
<p>"By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself, my lord?" asked Tom, turning to a learned judge.</p>
<p>"The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty matter, good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope with the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders. &#160;The <i>Devil</i> may buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto, but not an Englishman&#8212;in this latter case the contract would be null and void."</p>
<p>"It seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English law denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!" cried Tom, with honest heat.</p>
<p>This novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored away in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom's originality as well as progress toward mental health.</p>
<p>The elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom's words with an excited interest and a growing hope. &#160;Tom noticed this, and it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and unfriended situation. &#160;Presently he asked&#8212;</p>
<p>"How wrought they to bring the storm?"</p>
<p>"<i>By pulling off their stockings</i>, sire."</p>
<p>This astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat. He said, eagerly&#8212;</p>
<p>"It is wonderful! &#160;Hath it always this dread effect?"</p>
<p>"Always, my liege&#8212;at least if the woman desire it, and utter the needful words, either in her mind or with her tongue."</p>
<p>Tom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal&#8212;</p>
<p>"Exert thy power&#8212;I would see a storm!"</p>
<p>There was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and a general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place&#8212;all of which was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed cataclysm. &#160;Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman's face, he added, excitedly&#8212;</p>
<p>"Never fear&#8212;thou shalt be blameless. &#160;More&#8212;thou shalt go free&#8212;none shall touch thee. &#160;Exert thy power."</p>
<p>"Oh, my lord the King, I have it not&#8212;I have been falsely accused."</p>
<p>"Thy fears stay thee. &#160;Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm. &#160;Make a storm&#8212;it mattereth not how small a one&#8212;I require nought great or harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite&#8212;do this and thy life is spared&#8212;thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King's pardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm."</p>
<p>The woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had no power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her child's life alone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King's command so precious a grace might be acquired.</p>
<p>Tom urged&#8212;the woman still adhered to her declarations. &#160;Finally he said&#8212;</p>
<p>"I think the woman hath said true. &#160;An' <i>my</i> mother were in her place and gifted with the devil's functions, she had not stayed a moment to call her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my forfeit life were the price she got! &#160;It is argument that other mothers are made in like mould. &#160;Thou art free, goodwife&#8212;thou and thy child&#8212;for I do think thee innocent. &#160;<i>Now</i> thou'st nought to fear, being pardoned&#8212;pull off thy stockings!&#8212;an' thou canst make me a storm, thou shalt be rich!"</p>
<p>The redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to obey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred by apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided discomfort and uneasiness. &#160;The woman stripped her own feet and her little girl's also, and plainly did her best to reward the King's generosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure and a disappointment. &#160;Tom sighed, and said&#8212;</p>
<p>"There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is departed out of thee. &#160;Go thy way in peace; and if it return to thee at any time, forget me not, but fetch me a storm."</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00016">Chapter XVI. The State Dinner.</h2>
<p>The dinner hour drew near&#8212;yet strangely enough, the thought brought but slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror. &#160;The morning's experiences had wonderfully built up his confidence; the poor little ash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret, after four days' habit, than a mature person could have become in a full month. &#160;A child's facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more strikingly illustrated.</p>
<p>Let us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a glance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the imposing occasion. &#160;It is a spacious apartment, with gilded pillars and pilasters, and pictured walls and ceilings. &#160;At the door stand tall guards, as rigid as statues, dressed in rich and picturesque costumes, and bearing halberds. &#160;In a high gallery which runs all around the place is a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes, in brilliant attire. &#160;In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform, is Tom's table. Now let the ancient chronicler speak:</p>
<p>"A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him another bearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times with the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after kneeling again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod again, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and bread; when they have kneeled as the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the table, they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first; at last come two nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife, who, after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful manner, approach and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe as if the King had been present."</p>
<p>So end the solemn preliminaries. &#160;Now, far down the echoing corridors we hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, "Place for the King! &#160;Way for the King's most excellent majesty!" &#160;These sounds are momently repeated&#8212;they grow nearer and nearer&#8212;and presently, almost in our faces, the martial note peals and the cry rings out, "Way for the King!" &#160;At this instant the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door, with a measured march. Let the chronicler speak again:&#8212;</p>
<p>"First come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly dressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between two, one of which carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of State in a red scabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next comes the King himself&#8212;whom, upon his appearing, twelve trumpets and many drums salute with a great burst of welcome, whilst all in the galleries rise in their places, crying 'God save the King!' &#160;After him come nobles attached to his person, and on his right and left march his guard of honour, his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes."</p>
<p>This was all fine and pleasant. &#160;Tom's pulse beat high, and a glad light was in his eye. &#160;He bore himself right gracefully, and all the more so because he was not thinking of how he was doing it, his mind being charmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him&#8212;and besides, nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful clothes after he has grown a little used to them&#8212;especially if he is for the moment unconscious of them. Tom remembered his instructions, and acknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head, and a courteous "I thank ye, my good people."</p>
<p>He seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it without the least embarrassment; for to eat with one's cap on was the one solitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon common ground, neither party having any advantage over the other in the matter of old familiarity with it. &#160;The pageant broke up and grouped itself picturesquely, and remained bareheaded.</p>
<p>Now to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered,&#8212;"the tallest and mightiest men in England, they being carefully selected in this regard"&#8212;but we will let the chronicler tell about it:&#8212;</p>
<p>"The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in scarlet, with golden roses upon their backs; and these went and came, bringing in each turn a course of dishes, served in plate. &#160;These dishes were received by a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and placed upon the table, while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the particular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison."</p>
<p>Tom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds of eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an interest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly explosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about the place. &#160;He was careful not to hurry, and equally careful not to do anything whatever for himself, but wait till the proper official knelt down and did it for him. &#160;He got through without a mistake&#8212;flawless and precious triumph.</p>
<p>When the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his bright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles, rolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad to endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself free from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office.</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00017">Chapter XVII. Foo-foo the First.</h2>
<p>Miles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge, keeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and expecting to overtake them presently. &#160;He was disappointed in this, however. &#160;By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the way through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as to how to proceed. &#160;Still, he continued his efforts as best he could during the rest of the day. &#160;Nightfall found him leg-weary, half-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so he supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early start in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search. &#160;As he lay thinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus: &#160;The boy would escape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go back to London and seek his former haunts? &#160;No, he would not do that, he would avoid recapture. What, then, would he do? &#160;Never having had a friend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would naturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not require him to go toward London and danger. &#160;He would strike for Hendon Hall, that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound and there he might expect to find him. &#160;Yes, the case was plain to Hendon&#8212;he must lose no more time in Southwark, but move at once through Kent, toward Monk's Holm, searching the wood and inquiring as he went. &#160;Let us return to the vanished little King now.</p>
<p>The ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw 'about to join' the youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close behind them and followed their steps. &#160;He said nothing. His left arm was in a sling, and he wore a large green patch over his left eye; he limped slightly, and used an oaken staff as a support. &#160;The youth led the King a crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the high road beyond. &#160;The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop here&#8212;it was Hendon's place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon. &#160;He would not endure such insolence; he would stop where he was. &#160;The youth said&#8212;</p>
<p>"Thou'lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder? &#160;So be it, then."</p>
<p>The King's manner changed at once. &#160;He cried out&#8212;</p>
<p>"Wounded? &#160;And who hath dared to do it? &#160;But that is apart; lead on, lead on! &#160;Faster, sirrah! &#160;Art shod with lead? &#160;Wounded, is he? &#160;Now though the doer of it be a duke's son he shall rue it!"</p>
<p>It was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily traversed. The youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking in the ground, with a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way into the forest, watching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals; they were evidently guides to the point he was aiming at. &#160;By-and-by an open place was reached, where were the charred remains of a farm-house, and near them a barn which was falling to ruin and decay. &#160;There was no sign of life anywhere, and utter silence prevailed. &#160;The youth entered the barn, the King following eagerly upon his heels. &#160;No one there! The King shot a surprised and suspicious glance at the youth, and asked&#8212;</p>
<p>"Where is he?"</p>
<p>A mocking laugh was his answer. &#160;The King was in a rage in a moment; he seized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth when another mocking laugh fell upon his ear. &#160;It was from the lame ruffian who had been following at a distance. The King turned and said angrily&#8212;</p>
<p>"Who art thou? &#160;What is thy business here?"</p>
<p>"Leave thy foolery," said the man, "and quiet thyself. &#160;My disguise is none so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through it."</p>
<p>"Thou art not my father. &#160;I know thee not. &#160;I am the King. &#160;If thou hast hid my servant, find him for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou hast done."</p>
<p>John Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice&#8212;</p>
<p>"It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee; &#160;but if thou provoke me, I must. &#160;Thy prating doth no harm here, where there are no ears that need to mind thy follies; yet it is well to practise thy tongue to wary speech, that it may do no hurt when our quarters change. &#160;I have done a murder, and may not tarry at home&#8212;neither shalt thou, seeing I need thy service. &#160;My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is Hobbs&#8212;John Hobbs; thine is Jack&#8212;charge thy memory accordingly. &#160;Now, then, speak. &#160;Where is thy mother? &#160;Where are thy sisters? &#160;They came not to the place appointed&#8212;knowest thou whither they went?"</p>
<p>The King answered sullenly&#8212;</p>
<p>"Trouble me not with these riddles. &#160;My mother is dead; my sisters are in the palace."</p>
<p>The youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King would have assaulted him, but Canty&#8212;or Hobbs, as he now called himself&#8212;prevented him, and said&#8212;</p>
<p>"Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret him. Sit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat, anon."</p>
<p>Hobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the King removed himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company. &#160;He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn, where he found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw. &#160;He lay down here, drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed in thinking. &#160;He had many griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost into forgetfulness by the supreme one, the loss of his father. &#160;To the rest of the world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and suggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand dealt scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only sensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance that was all gentleness and affection. &#160;He called to mind a long succession of loving passages between his father and himself, and dwelt fondly upon them, his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that possessed his heart. As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with his troubles, sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber.</p>
<p>After a considerable time&#8212;he could not tell how long&#8212;his senses struggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes vaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he noted a murmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof. A snug sense of comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken, the next moment, by a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter. &#160;It startled him disagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption proceeded. &#160;A grim and unsightly picture met his eye. &#160;A bright fire was burning in the middle of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and around it, and lit weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the motliest company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he had ever read or dreamed of. &#160;There were huge stalwart men, brown with exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there were middle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly clad; there were blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones, with wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with running sores peeping from ineffectual wrappings; there was a villain-looking pedlar with his pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker, and a barber-surgeon, with the implements of their trades; some of the females were hardly-grown girls, some were at prime, some were old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud, brazen, foul-mouthed; and all soiled and slatternly; there were three sore-faced babies; there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings about their necks, whose office was to lead the blind.</p>
<p>The night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy was beginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A general cry broke forth&#8212;</p>
<p>"A song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!"</p>
<p>One of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the patches that sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard which recited the cause of his calamity. &#160;Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself of his timber leg and took his place, upon sound and healthy limbs, beside his fellow-rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty, and were reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of each stanza, in a rousing chorus. &#160;By the time the last stanza was reached, the half-drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch, that everybody joined in and sang it clear through from the beginning, producing a volume of villainous sound that made the rafters quake. &#160;These were the inspiring words:&#8212;</p>
<p>'Bien Darkman's then, Bouse Mort and Ken,<br/>
The bien Coves bings awast,<br/>
On Chates to trine by Rome Coves dine<br/>
For his long lib at last.<br/>
Bing'd out bien Morts and toure, and toure,<br/>
Bing out of the Rome vile bine,<br/>
And toure the Cove that cloy'd your duds,<br/>
Upon the Chates to trine.'<br/><br/>
(From'The English Rogue.' London, 1665.)</p>
<p>Conversation followed; not in the thieves' dialect of the song, for that was only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening. &#160;In the course of it, it appeared that 'John Hobbs' was not altogether a new recruit, but had trained in the gang at some former time. &#160;His later history was called for, and when he said he had 'accidentally' killed a man, considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the man was a priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with everybody. &#160;Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new ones were proud to shake him by the hand. &#160;He was asked why he had 'tarried away so many months.' &#160;He answered&#8212;</p>
<p>"London is better than the country, and safer, these late years, the laws be so bitter and so diligently enforced. &#160;An' I had not had that accident, I had stayed there. &#160;I had resolved to stay, and never more venture country-wards&#8212;but the accident has ended that."</p>
<p>He inquired how many persons the gang numbered now. &#160;The 'ruffler,' or chief, answered&#8212;</p>
<p>"Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and maunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. Most are here, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We follow at dawn."</p>
<p>"I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me. &#160;Where may he be?"</p>
<p>"Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a delicate taste. He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about midsummer."</p>
<p>"I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and brave."</p>
<p>"That was he, truly. &#160;Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet, but absent on the eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none ever seeing her drunk above four days in the seven."</p>
<p>"She was ever strict&#8212;I remember it well&#8212;a goodly wench and worthy all commendation. &#160;Her mother was more free and less particular; a troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above the common."</p>
<p>"We lost her through it. &#160;Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of fortune-telling begot for her at last a witch's name and fame. The law roasted her to death at a slow fire. &#160;It did touch me to a sort of tenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot&#8212;cursing and reviling all the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked upward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about her old gray head&#8212;cursing them! why an' thou should'st live a thousand years thoud'st never hear so masterful a cursing. &#160;Alack, her art died with her. &#160;There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true blasphemy."</p>
<p>The Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general depression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened outcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able to feel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and under peculiarly favouring circumstances&#8212;as in cases like to this, for instance, when genius and culture depart and leave no heir. &#160;However, a deep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners.</p>
<p>"Have any others of our friends fared hardly?" asked Hobbs.</p>
<p>"Some&#8212;yes. &#160;Particularly new comers&#8212;such as small husbandmen turned shiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from them to be changed to sheep ranges. &#160;They begged, and were whipped at the cart's tail, naked from the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set in the stocks to be pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and deprived of an ear; they begged a third time&#8212;poor devils, what else could they do?&#8212;and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then sold for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged. &#160;'Tis a brief tale, and quickly told. &#160;Others of us have fared less hardly. Stand forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge&#8212;show your adornments!"</p>
<p>These stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing their backs, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash; one turned up his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been; another showed a brand upon his shoulder&#8212;the letter V&#8212;and a mutilated ear; the third said&#8212;</p>
<p>"I am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and kids&#8212;now am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the wife and kids are gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in&#8212;in the other place&#8212;but the kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in <i>England</i>! &#160;My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick; one of these died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for a witch, whilst my babes looked on and wailed. &#160;English law!&#8212;up, all, with your cups!&#8212;now all together and with a cheer!&#8212;drink to the merciful English law that delivered <i>her</i> from the English hell! &#160;Thank you, mates, one and all. &#160;I begged, from house to house&#8212;I and the wife&#8212;bearing with us the hungry kids&#8212;but it was crime to be hungry in England&#8212;so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns. &#160;Drink ye all again to the merciful English law!&#8212;for its lash drank deep of my Mary's blood and its blessed deliverance came quick. &#160;She lies there, in the potter's field, safe from all harms. &#160;And the kids&#8212;well, whilst the law lashed me from town to town, they starved. Drink, lads&#8212;only a drop&#8212;a drop to the poor kids, that never did any creature harm. &#160;I begged again&#8212;begged, for a crust, and got the stocks and lost an ear&#8212;see, here bides the stump; I begged again, and here is the stump of the other to keep me minded of it. And still I begged again, and was sold for a slave&#8212;here on my cheek under this stain, if I washed it off, ye might see the red S the branding-iron left there! &#160;A <i>slave</i>! &#160;Do you understand that word? &#160;An English <i>slave</i>!&#8212;that is he that stands before ye. &#160;I have run from my master, and when I am found&#8212;the heavy curse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it!&#8212;I shall hang!"</p>
<p>A ringing voice came through the murky air&#8212;</p>
<p>"Thou shalt <i>not</i>!&#8212;and this day the end of that law is come!"</p>
<p>All turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching hurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed, a general explosion of inquiries broke out&#8212;</p>
<p>"Who is it? &#160;<i>What</i> is it? &#160;Who art thou, manikin?"</p>
<p>The boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and questioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity&#8212;</p>
<p>"I am Edward, King of England."</p>
<p>A wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly of delight in the excellence of the joke. &#160;The King was stung. &#160;He said sharply&#8212;</p>
<p>"Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal boon I have promised?"</p>
<p>He said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was lost in a whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations. &#160;'John Hobbs' made several attempts to make himself heard above the din, and at last succeeded&#8212;saying&#8212;</p>
<p>"Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad&#8212;mind him not&#8212;he thinketh he <i>is</i> the King."</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> the King," said Edward, turning toward him, "as thou shalt know to thy cost, in good time. &#160;Thou hast confessed a murder&#8212;thou shalt swing for it."</p>
<p>"<i>Thou'lt</i> betray me?&#8212;<i>thou</i>? &#160;An' I get my hands upon thee&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Tut-tut!" said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save the King, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist, "hast respect for neither Kings <i>nor</i> Rufflers? &#160;An' thou insult my presence so again, I'll hang thee up myself." &#160;Then he said to his Majesty, "Thou must make no threats against thy mates, lad; and thou must guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere. &#160;<i>Be king</i>, if it please thy mad humour, but be not harmful in it. &#160;Sink the title thou hast uttered&#8212;'tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but none among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving and loyal hearts, in that regard. &#160;Note if I speak truth. &#160;Now&#8212;all together: &#160;'Long live Edward, King of England!'"</p>
<p>"LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!"</p>
<p>The response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the crazy building vibrated to the sound. &#160;The little King's face lighted with pleasure for an instant, and he slightly inclined his head, and said with grave simplicity&#8212;</p>
<p>"I thank you, my good people."</p>
<p>This unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment. When something like quiet was presently come again, the Ruffler said, firmly, but with an accent of good nature&#8212;</p>
<p>"Drop it, boy, 'tis not wise, nor well. &#160;Humour thy fancy, if thou must, but choose some other title."</p>
<p>A tinker shrieked out a suggestion&#8212;</p>
<p>"Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!"</p>
<p>The title 'took,' at once, every throat responded, and a roaring shout went up, of&#8212;</p>
<p>"Long live Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!" followed by hootings, cat-calls, and peals of laughter.</p>
<p>"Hale him forth, and crown him!"</p>
<p>"Robe him!"</p>
<p>"Sceptre him!"</p>
<p>"Throne him!"</p>
<p>These and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost before the poor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin, robed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a barrel, and sceptred with the tinker's soldering-iron. &#160;Then all flung themselves upon their knees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking supplications, whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and ragged sleeves and aprons&#8212;</p>
<p>"Be gracious to us, O sweet King!"</p>
<p>"Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!"</p>
<p>"Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!"</p>
<p>"Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of sovereignty!"</p>
<p>"Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat the dirt and be ennobled!"</p>
<p>"Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children's children may tell of thy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for ever!"</p>
<p>But the humorous tinker made the 'hit' of the evening and carried off the honours. &#160;Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King's foot, and was indignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste over the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying it must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he should make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to view at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight. &#160;He made himself so killingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy rabble.</p>
<p>Tears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch's eyes; and the thought in his heart was, "Had I offered them a deep wrong they could not be more cruel&#8212;yet have I proffered nought but to do them a kindness&#8212;and it is thus they use me for it!"</p>
<h2 id="dlepubid00018">Chapter XVIII. The Prince with the Tramps.</h2>
<p>The troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward on their march. &#160;There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy ground under foot, and a winter chill in the air. &#160;All gaiety was gone from the company; some were sullen and silent, some were irritable and petulant, none were gentle-humoured, all were thirsty.</p>
<p>The Ruffler put 'Jack' in Hugo's charge, with some brief instructions, and commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone; he also warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad.</p>
<p>After a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat. The troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve. &#160;They grew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and insult passengers along the highway. &#160;This showed that they were awaking to an appreciation of life and its joys once more. &#160;The dread in which their sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them the road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing to talk back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full view of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that they did not take the hedges, too.</p>
<p>By-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to furnish a breakfast for them. &#160;They chucked the housewife and her daughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands, and made coarse jests about them, accompanied with insulting epithets and bursts of horse-laughter. &#160;They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer and his sons, kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously when a good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of the daughters who resented some of their familiarities. &#160;When they took their leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the heads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the authorities.</p>
<p>About noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a halt behind a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village. &#160;An hour was allowed for rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village at different points to ply their various trades&#8212;'Jack' was sent with Hugo. &#160;They wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching for opportunities to do a stroke of business, but finding none&#8212;so he finally said&#8212;</p>
<p>"I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place. &#160;Wherefore we will beg."</p>
<p>"<i>We</i>, forsooth! &#160;Follow thy trade&#8212;it befits thee. &#160;But <i>I</i> will not beg."</p>
<p>"Thou'lt not beg!" exclaimed Hugo, eyeing the King with surprise. "Prithee, since when hast thou reformed?"</p>
<p>"What dost thou mean?"</p>
<p>"Mean? &#160;Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life?"</p>
<p>"I? &#160;Thou idiot!"</p>
<p>"Spare thy compliments&#8212;thy stock will last the longer. &#160;Thy father says thou hast begged all thy days. &#160;Mayhap he lied. Peradventure you will even make so bold as to <i>say</i> he lied," scoffed Hugo.</p>
<p>"Him <i>you</i> call my father? &#160;Yes, he lied."</p>
<p>"Come, play not thy merry game of madman so far, mate; use it for thy amusement, not thy hurt. &#160;An' I tell him this, he will scorch thee finely for it."</p>
<p>"Save thyself the trouble. &#160;I will tell him."</p>
<p>"I like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not admire thy judgment. Bone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life, without going out of one's way to invite them. &#160;But a truce to these matters; <i>I</i> believe your father. &#160;I doubt not he can lie; I doubt not he <i>doth</i> lie, upon occasion, for the best of us do that; but there is no occasion here. &#160;A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for nought. &#160;But come; sith it is thy humour to give over begging, wherewithal shall we busy ourselves? &#160;With robbing kitchens?"</p>
<p>The King said, impatiently&#8212;</p>
<p>"Have done with this folly&#8212;you weary me!"</p>
<p>Hugo replied, with temper&#8212;</p>
<p>"Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it. But I will tell you what you <i>will</i> do. &#160;You will play decoy whilst <i>I</i> beg. Refuse, an' you think you may venture!"</p>
<p>The King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said, interrupting&#8212;</p>
<p>"Peace! &#160;Here comes one with a kindly face. &#160;Now will I fall down in a fit. &#160;When the stranger runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon your knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as all the devils of misery were in your belly, and say, 'Oh, sir, it is my poor afflicted brother, and we be friendless; o' God's name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful look upon a sick, forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow one little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready to perish!'&#8212;and mind you, keep you <i>on</i> wailing, and abate not till we bilk him of his penny, else shall you rue it."</p>
<p>Then immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his eyes, and reel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at hand, down he sprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to writhe and wallow in the dirt, in seeming agony.</p>
<p>"O, dear, O dear!" cried the benevolent stranger, "O poor soul, poor soul, how he doth suffer! &#160;There&#8212;let me help thee up."</p>
<p>"O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely gentleman&#8212;but it giveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so. &#160;My brother there will tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be upon me. &#160;A penny, dear sir, a penny, to buy a little food; then leave me to my sorrows."</p>
<p>"A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,"&#8212;and he fumbled in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. "There, poor lad, take them and most welcome. &#160;Now come hither, my boy, and help me carry thy stricken brother to yon house, where&#8212;"</p>
<p>"I am not his brother," said the King, interrupting.</p>
<p>"What! not his brother?"</p>
<p>"Oh, hear him!" groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth. "He denies his own brother&#8212;and he with one foot in the grave!"</p>
<p>"Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother. &#160;For shame!&#8212;and he scarce able to move hand or foot. &#160;If he is not thy brother, who is he, then?"</p>
