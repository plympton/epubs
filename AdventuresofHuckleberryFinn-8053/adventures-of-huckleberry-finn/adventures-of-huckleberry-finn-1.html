<body>
<p>Everybody was willing. &#160;So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. &#160;It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. &#160;And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.</p>
<p>Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head. &#160;He said, some of it, but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.</p>
<p>Some thought it would be good to kill the <i>families</i> of boys that told the secrets. &#160;Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:</p>
<p>"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout him?"</p>
<p>"Well, hain't he got a father?" says Tom Sawyer.</p>
<p>"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. &#160;He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more."</p>
<p>They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others. &#160;Well, nobody could think of anything to do&#8212;everybody was stumped, and set still. &#160;I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson&#8212;they could kill her. &#160;Everybody said:</p>
<p>"Oh, she'll do. &#160;That's all right. &#160;Huck can come in."</p>
<p>Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.</p>
<p>"Now," says Ben Rogers, "what's the line of business of this Gang?"</p>
<p>"Nothing only robbery and murder," Tom said.</p>
<p>"But who are we going to rob?&#8212;houses, or cattle, or&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary," says Tom Sawyer. &#160;"We ain't burglars. &#160;That ain't no sort of style. &#160;We are highwaymen. &#160;We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money."</p>
<p>"Must we always kill the people?"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly. &#160;It's best. &#160;Some authorities think different, but mostly it's considered best to kill them&#8212;except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed."</p>
<p>"Ransomed? &#160;What's that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. &#160;But that's what they do. &#160;I've seen it in books; and so of course that's what we've got to do."</p>
<p>"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?"</p>
<p>"Why, blame it all, we've <i>got</i> to do it. &#160;Don't I tell you it's in the books? &#160;Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books, and get things all muddled up?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all very fine to <i>say</i>, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to them?&#8212;that's the thing I want to get at. &#160;Now, what do you reckon it is?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know. &#160;But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead."</p>
<p>"Now, that's something <i>like</i>. &#160;That'll answer. &#160;Why couldn't you said that before? &#160;We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they'll be, too&#8212;eating up everything, and always trying to get loose."</p>
<p>"How you talk, Ben Rogers. &#160;How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?"</p>
<p>"A guard! &#160;Well, that <i>is</i> good. &#160;So somebody's got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. &#160;I think that's foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?"</p>
<p>"Because it ain't in the books so&#8212;that's why. &#160;Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don't you?&#8212;that's the idea. &#160;Don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do? &#160;Do you reckon <i>you</i> can learn 'em anything? &#160;Not by a good deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way."</p>
<p>"All right. &#160;I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. &#160;Say, do we kill the women, too?"</p>
<p>"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. &#160;Kill the women? &#160;No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. &#160;You fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more."</p>
<p>"Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it. Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say."</p>
<p>Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't want to be a robber any more.</p>
<p>So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. &#160;But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.</p>
<p>Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. &#160;They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.</p>
<p>I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.</p>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could. &#160;Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. &#160;She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. &#160;But it warn't so. &#160;I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. &#160;It warn't any good to me without hooks. &#160;I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn't make it work. &#160;By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. &#160;She never told me why, and I couldn't make it out no way.</p>
<p>I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it. &#160;I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? &#160;Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? &#160;Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. &#160;I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was "spiritual gifts." &#160;This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant&#8212;I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. &#160;I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it&#8212;except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go. &#160;Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. &#160;I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more. &#160;I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.</p>
<p>Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for me; I didn't want to see him no more. &#160;He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. &#160;Well, about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said. &#160;They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all. &#160;They said he was floating on his back in the water. &#160;They took him and buried him on the bank. &#160;But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. &#160;I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back, but on his face. &#160;So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes. &#160;So I was uncomfortable again. &#160;I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he wouldn't.</p>
<p>We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. &#160;All the boys did. &#160;We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended. &#160;We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. &#160;Tom Sawyer called the hogs "ingots," and he called the turnips and stuff "julery," and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. &#160;But I couldn't see no profit in it. &#160;One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand "sumter" mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. &#160;He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. &#160;He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. &#160;I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. &#160;But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. &#160;It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. &#160;We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.</p>
<p>&#160;I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. &#160;He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. &#160;I said, why couldn't we see them, then? &#160;He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. &#160;He said it was all done by enchantment. &#160;He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. &#160;I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. &#160;Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.</p>
<p>"Why," said he, "a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. &#160;They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church."</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "s'pose we got some genies to help <i>us</i>&#8212;can't we lick the other crowd then?"</p>
<p>"How you going to get them?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. &#160;How do <i>they</i> get them?"</p>
<p>"Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it. &#160;They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it&#8212;or any other man."</p>
<p>"Who makes them tear around so?"</p>
<p>"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. &#160;They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says. &#160;If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor's daughter from China for you to marry, they've got to do it&#8212;and they've got to do it before sun-up next morning, too. &#160;And more: &#160;they've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you understand."</p>
<p>"Well," says I, "I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that. &#160;And what's more&#8212;if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp."</p>
<p>"How you talk, Huck Finn. &#160;Why, you'd <i>have</i> to come when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not."</p>
<p>"What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? &#160;All right, then; I <i>would</i> come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country."</p>
<p>"Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. &#160;You don't seem to know anything, somehow&#8212;perfect saphead."</p>
<p>I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it. &#160;I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't no use, none of the genies come. &#160;So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies. &#160;I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. &#160;It had all the marks of a Sunday-school.</p>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever. &#160;I don't take no stock in mathematics, anyway.</p>
<p>At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. &#160;So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be. &#160;I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me. &#160;Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me. &#160;I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. &#160;She said she warn't ashamed of me.</p>
<p>One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. &#160;I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, "Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!" &#160;The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. &#160;I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. &#160;There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.</p>
<p>I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence. &#160;There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody's tracks. &#160;They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden fence. &#160;It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so. &#160;I couldn't make it out. &#160;It was very curious, somehow. &#160;I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. &#160;I didn't notice anything at first, but next I did. &#160;There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.</p>
<p>I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. &#160;I looked over my shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. &#160;I was at Judge Thatcher's as quick as I could get there. &#160;He said:</p>
<p>"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. &#160;Did you come for your interest?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," I says; "is there some for me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night&#8212;over a hundred and fifty dollars. &#160;Quite a fortune for you. &#160;You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it."</p>
<p>"No, sir," I says, "I don't want to spend it. &#160;I don't want it at all&#8212;nor the six thousand, nuther. &#160;I want you to take it; I want to give it to you&#8212;the six thousand and all."</p>
<p>He looked surprised. &#160;He couldn't seem to make it out. &#160;He says:</p>
<p>"Why, what can you mean, my boy?"</p>
<p>I says, "Don't you ask me no questions about it, please. &#160;You'll take it&#8212;won't you?"</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<p>"Well, I'm puzzled. &#160;Is something the matter?"</p>
<p>"Please take it," says I, "and don't ask me nothing&#8212;then I won't have to tell no lies."</p>
<p>He studied a while, and then he says:</p>
<p>"Oho-o! &#160;I think I see. &#160;You want to <i>sell</i> all your property to me&#8212;not give it. &#160;That's the correct idea."</p>
<p>Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:</p>
<p>"There; you see it says 'for a consideration.' &#160;That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. &#160;Here's a dollar for you. &#160;Now you sign it."</p>
<p>So I signed it, and left.</p>
<p>Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it. &#160;He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything. &#160;So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. &#160;What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? &#160;Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. &#160;It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. &#160;Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. &#160;Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. &#160;But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. &#160;I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. &#160;(I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference. &#160;Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. &#160;He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. &#160;Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.</p>
<p>Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. &#160;He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. &#160;I says, go on. &#160;So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. &#160;He says:</p>
<p>"Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do. &#160;Sometimes he spec he'll go 'way, en den agin he spec he'll stay. &#160;De bes' way is to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way. &#160;Dey's two angels hoverin' roun' 'bout him. &#160;One uv 'em is white en shiny, en t'other one is black. De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up. &#160;A body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las'. &#160;But you is all right. &#160;You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo' life, en considable joy. &#160;Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you's gwyne to git well agin. &#160;Dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life. &#160;One uv 'em's light en t'other one is dark. One is rich en t'other is po'. &#160;You's gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by. &#160;You wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don't run no resk, 'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung."</p>
<p>When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self!</p>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>I had shut the door to. &#160;Then I turned around and there he was. &#160;I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. &#160;I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken&#8212;that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn't scared of him worth bothring about.</p>
<p>He was most fifty, and he looked it. &#160;His hair was long and tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines. &#160;It was all black, no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers. &#160;There warn't no color in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl&#8212;a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. &#160;As for his clothes&#8212;just rags, that was all. &#160;He had one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then. &#160;His hat was laying on the floor&#8212;an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.</p>
<p>I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair tilted back a little. &#160;I set the candle down. &#160;I noticed the window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. &#160;He kept a-looking me all over. &#160;By and by he says:</p>
<p>"Starchy clothes&#8212;very. &#160;You think you're a good deal of a big-bug, <i>don't</i> you?"</p>
<p>"Maybe I am, maybe I ain't," I says.</p>
<p>"Don't you give me none o' your lip," says he. &#160;"You've put on considerable many frills since I been away. &#160;I'll take you down a peg before I get done with you. &#160;You're educated, too, they say&#8212;can read and write. &#160;You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because he can't? &#160;<i>I'll</i> take it out of you. &#160;Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness, hey?&#8212;who told you you could?"</p>
<p>"The widow. &#160;She told me."</p>
<p>"The widow, hey?&#8212;and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain't none of her business?"</p>
<p>"Nobody never told her."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll learn her how to meddle. &#160;And looky here&#8212;you drop that school, you hear? &#160;I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what <i>he</i> is. &#160;You lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? &#160;Your mother couldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther, before she died. &#160;None of the family couldn't before <i>they</i> died. &#160;I can't; and here you're a-swelling yourself up like this. &#160;I ain't the man to stand it&#8212;you hear? Say, lemme hear you read."</p>
<p>I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house. &#160;He says:</p>
<p>"It's so. &#160;You can do it. &#160;I had my doubts when you told me. &#160;Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. &#160;I won't have it. &#160;I'll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I'll tan you good. First you know you'll get religion, too. &#160;I never see such a son."</p>
<p>He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and says:</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>"It's something they give me for learning my lessons good."</p>
<p>He tore it up, and says:</p>
<p>"I'll give you something better&#8212;I'll give you a cowhide."</p>
<p>He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:</p>
<p>"<i>Ain't</i> you a sweet-scented dandy, though? &#160;A bed; and bedclothes; and a look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor&#8212;and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. &#160;I never see such a son. &#160;I bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with you. Why, there ain't no end to your airs&#8212;they say you're rich. &#160;Hey?&#8212;how's that?"</p>
<p>"They lie&#8212;that's how."</p>
<p>"Looky here&#8212;mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can stand now&#8212;so don't gimme no sass. &#160;I've been in town two days, and I hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich. &#160;I heard about it away down the river, too. &#160;That's why I come. &#160;You git me that money to-morrow&#8212;I want it."</p>
<p>"I hain't got no money."</p>
<p>"It's a lie. &#160;Judge Thatcher's got it. &#160;You git it. &#160;I want it."</p>
<p>"I hain't got no money, I tell you. &#160;You ask Judge Thatcher; he'll tell you the same."</p>
<p>"All right. &#160;I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or I'll know the reason why. &#160;Say, how much you got in your pocket? &#160;I want it."</p>
<p>"I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to&#8212;"</p>
<p>"It don't make no difference what you want it for&#8212;you just shell it out."</p>
<p>He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink all day. When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't drop that.</p>
<p>Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn't, and then he swore he'd make the law force him.</p>
<p>The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druther not take a child away from its father. &#160;So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business.</p>
<p>That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. &#160;He said he'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him. &#160;I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed him again for a week. &#160;But he said <i>he</i> was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he'd make it warm for <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak. &#160;And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him. &#160;The judge said he could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it. &#160;The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried again. &#160;And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand, and says:</p>
<p>"Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it. There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and'll die before he'll go back. &#160;You mark them words&#8212;don't forget I said them. &#160;It's a clean hand now; shake it&#8212;don't be afeard."</p>
<p>So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. &#160;The judge's wife she kissed it. &#160;Then the old man he signed a pledge&#8212;made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. &#160;And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it.</p>
<p>The judge he felt kind of sore. &#160;He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way.</p>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. &#160;He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. &#160;I didn't want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. &#160;That law trial was a slow business&#8212;appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. &#160;Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. &#160;He was just suited&#8212;this kind of thing was right in his line.</p>
<p>He got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at last that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well, <i>wasn't</i> he mad? &#160;He said he would show who was Huck Finn's boss. &#160;So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.</p>
<p>He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights. &#160;He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. &#160;Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. &#160;The widow she found out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it&#8212;all but the cowhide part.</p>
<p>It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. &#160;Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. &#160;I didn't want to go back no more. &#160;I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't no objections. &#160;It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around.</p>
<p>But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand it. I was all over welts. &#160;He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. &#160;Once he locked me in and was gone three days. &#160;It was dreadful lonesome. &#160;I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever going to get out any more. &#160;I was scared. &#160;I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. &#160;I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. &#160;There warn't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through. &#160;I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. &#160;The door was thick, solid oak slabs. &#160;Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. &#160;But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. &#160;There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. &#160;I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out&#8212;big enough to let me through. &#160;Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. &#160;I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.</p>
<p>Pap warn't in a good humor&#8212;so he was his natural self. &#160;He said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. &#160;His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. &#160;This shook me up considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. &#160;Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.</p>
<p>He said he would like to see the widow get me. &#160;He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't find me. &#160;That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that chance.</p>
<p>The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. &#160;I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. &#160;I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. &#160;I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn't ever find me any more. &#160;I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. &#160;I got so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.</p>
<p>I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. &#160;While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. &#160;He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. &#160;A body would a thought he was Adam&#8212;he was just all mud. &#160;Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:</p>
<p>"Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like. Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him&#8212;a man's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. &#160;Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for <i>him</i> and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. &#160;And they call <i>that</i> govment! &#160;That ain't all, nuther. &#160;The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property. &#160;Here's what the law does: &#160;The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that govment! &#160;A man can't get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I <i>told</i> 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. &#160;Lots of 'em heard me, and can tell what I said. &#160;Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. &#160;Them's the very words. &#160;I says look at my hat&#8212;if you call it a hat&#8212;but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stove-pipe. &#160;Look at it, says I&#8212;such a hat for me to wear&#8212;one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. &#160;Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio&#8212;a mulatter, most as white as a white man. &#160;He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane&#8212;the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. &#160;And what do you think? &#160;They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. &#160;And that ain't the wust. They said he could <i>vote</i> when he was at home. &#160;Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? &#160;It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. &#160;I says I'll never vote agin. &#160;Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me&#8212;I'll never vote agin as long as I live. &#160;And to see the cool way of that nigger&#8212;why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. &#160;I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold?&#8212;that's what I want to know. &#160;And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. &#160;There, now&#8212;that's a specimen. &#160;They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State six months. &#160;Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and&#8212;"</p>
<p>Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language&#8212;mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there. &#160;He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. &#160;But it warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous. &#160;He said so his own self afterwards. &#160;He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.</p>
<p>After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. &#160;That was always his word. &#160;I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. &#160;He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. &#160;He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. &#160;He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. &#160;At last I got so sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.</p>
